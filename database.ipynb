The SIREN\\n        hoots maniacally, masking all other sound.  Ripley\\n        scans the room with her light, her hair plastered\\n        to her face, wiping water out of her eyes.  She is\\n        eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She\\n        looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.\\n        Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT\\n        HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,\\n        splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles\\n        away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of\\n        her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings\\n        for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a\\n        steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling\\n        equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the\\n        floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of\\n        multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.\\n\\n        She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for\\n        its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,\\n        avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,\\n        backing away, until she is pressed up against a\\n        desk in one corner.\\n\\n        Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body\\n        back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around\\n        her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside\\n        of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,\\n        knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.\\n        Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her\\n        and making it impossible to get a grip on the creature's\\n        body.\\n\\n        ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the\\n        desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking\\n        fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the\\n        writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against\\n        all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.\\n        She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature\\n        gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing\\n        itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.\\n\\n        The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's\\n        head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head\\n        from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly\\n        from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing\\n        itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over\\n        her face.\\n\\n        A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette\\n        behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.\\n        Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of\\n        pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks\\n        dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes\\n        into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits\\n        rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and\\n        slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the\\n        thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between\\n        the two of them they force is away from her face,\\n        though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens\\n        sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the\\n        room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding\\n        across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature\\n        against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.\\n\\n        Gorman appears at Ripley's side and grabs the tail,\\n        unwinding its writhing length like a boa constrictor\\n        coil from her throat.  All of them grip the struggling,\\n        SHRIEKING creature.\\n\\n\",\n",

Inside\\n        the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless\\n        eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor\\n        where they emerge glistening, to be picked up by\\n        DRONES.
