Their\\n     search takes them to a wrecked alien spacecraft whose doors gape open\\n     -- it is dead and abandoned.  Inside they find, among other strange\\n     things, the skeleton of one of the unearthly space travellers.\\n\\n     Certain clues in the wrecked ship lead them across the hostile surface\\n     of the planet to a primitive stone pyramid, the only remnant of a\\n     vanished civilization.  Beneath this pyramid they find an ancient tomb\\n     full of fantastic artifacts.  Lying dormant in the tomb are centuries-\\n     old spores, which are triggered into life by the men\\'s presence.  A\\n     parasite emerges and fastens itself to one of the men\\'s faces -- and\\n     cannot be removed.\\n\\n     An examination by the ship\\'s medical computer reveals that the\\n     creature has inserted a tube down his throat, which is depositing\\n     something inside him.  Then it is discovered that the parasite\\'s blood\\n     is a horribly corrosive acid which eats through metal -- they dare not\\n     kill it on the ship.\\n\\n     Ultimately it is dislodged from its victim and ejected from the ship,\\n     and they blast off from the Hell-planet.  However, before they can seal\\n     themselves into suspended animation for the long voyage home, a\\n     horrible little monster emerges from the victim\\'s body -- it has been\\n     growing in him, deposited there by the parasite... and now it is loose\\n     on the ship.\\n\\n     A series of ghastly adventures follow.  They trap it in an air shaft\\n     and a man has to crawl down the shaft with a flamethrower -- it tears\\n     a man\\'s head off and runs away with his body -- a man is crushed in\\n     the air lock door and the ship loses most of its air in a terrific\\n     windstorm -- another man is burned to death and then eaten by the\\n     creature -- and another is woven into a cocoon as part of the alien\\'s\\n     bizarre life cycle.\\n\\n     Finally there is only one man left alive, alone on the ship with the\\n     creature, and only six hours till his air runs out; which leads to a\\n     climax of horrifying, explosive jeopardy, the outcome of which\\n     determines who will reach Earth alive -- man or alien.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                         CAST OF CHARACTERS\\n\\n     CHAZ STANDARD,\\n          Captain.................A leader and a politician.

Faust,\\n     prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of\\n     approaching the source of the signal.\\n\\n     He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any\\n     second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.\\n\\n     The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one\\n     wall.\\n\\n     Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust\\'s face as he sets\\n     down the tracker and reaches for the little door.  He raises the prod,\\n     grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod\\n     inside.\\n\\n     WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF\\n     THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.\\n\\n     Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (very annoyed)\\n               Oh, hold it!\\n\\n     They open the net and release the creature.

As the hatch\\n     closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.\\n\\n     Done in, he collapses to the floor.\\n\\n     Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath.  Because of\\n     the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD --\\n     THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE.  Roby is gasping loudly, but we can\\n     barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking\\n     underwater.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS\\n\\n     Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and\\n     Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping\\n     like fishes out of water.  They are sweating heavily and their noses\\n     bleed.\\n\\n     They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can\\n     only hear distant croaks.\\n\\n     Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall.  The others\\n     follow him.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM\\n\\n     The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging\\n     thinly on the metal flooring.  We see several rows of large oxygen\\n     tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.\\n\\n     Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening\\n     them.  THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL\\n     GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the\\n     floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.\\n\\n     Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               How much oxygen did we lose?\\n\\n     Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               We\\'ve got six hours left.\\n\\n                              HUNTER\\n                    (groans)\\n               Oh my God.\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               Does anybody know what happened?\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               I saw it.

Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat\\n     door a couple of times.  It slams open and shut quite rapidly.\\n\\n     He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to \"READY.\"\\n\\n     Then STANDARD\\'S VOICE comes from the communicator:\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n                    (over, filtered)\\n               We\\'ve got something on the\\n               tracker... got to be it, it\\'s\\n               too big for the cat.\\n\\n     This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO\\n     THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.\\n\\n                              HUNTER\\n                    (over, filtered)\\n               It\\'s coming from down there.\\n\\n     Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings,\\n     breathing, etc.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP\\n\\n     Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at\\n     the tracker.\\n\\n                              HUNTER\\n               It must have stopped moving.

Then THE CREATURE POPS\\n     OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.\\n\\n     HUNTER SCREAMS.\\n\\n     Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter.  It holds him\\n     off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.\\n\\n     Standard doesn\\'t know what to do.\\n\\n                              HUNTER\\n               The flamethrower!\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               I can\\'t, the acid will pour out!\\n\\n     At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN\\n     MORTAL AGONY.\\n\\n     Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires\\n     -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER\\n     CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.\\n\\n     Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of\\n     flame, held out at arm\\'s length by the monster.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP\\n\\n     Roby is listening to all this on the communicator.  He can hear the\\n     shrieks and crashing noises.\\n\\n     Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               Hello?  Standard?  Hunter?\\n\\n     He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his\\n     expression that he expects none.\\n\\n     He drops his face into his hands.  When he lifts his head again, he has\\n     managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other\\n     hand.  He comes across Standard\\'s flamethrower, lying on the floor.  He\\n     picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.\\n\\n     Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps\\n     into the maintenance level.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL\\n\\n     Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that\\n     the source of the signal is directly under his feet.  Looking down, he\\n     sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.\\n\\n     Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate,\\n     revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.\\n\\n     Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the\\n     flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM\\n\\n     Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal\\n     ladder to the floor.\\n\\n     THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH,\\n     PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.\\n\\n     Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.\\n\\n     HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON.  It appears to be woven from\\n     some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.\\n\\n     Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon.  As he gets close\\n     enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF\\n     STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.\\n\\n     Unexpectedly, Standard\\'s eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps\\n     violently.\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n                    (a feeble whisper)\\n               Kill me... \\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (sickened)\\n               What did it do to you?\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n                    (moves his head slightly)\\n               Look... \\n\\n     Roby turns his light where Standard indicates.  Another cocoon dangles\\n     from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different.  It is smaller\\n     and darker, with a harder shell.  In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE\\n     THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.\\n\\n                              STANDARD (CONT\\'D)\\n                    (whispering)\\n               That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter... \\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (looking around for a tool)\\n               I\\'ll get you out of there.\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               No... don\\'t... \\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               But I can save you -- get you to the\\n               Autodoc!\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               No good... it\\'s eaten too much of\\n               me... \\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (in horror)\\n               What can I do?\\n\\n                              STANDARD\\n               Kill me... \\n\\n     Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look\\n     at him.  REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and\\n     sprays a molten blast.  When the entire room is in flames, he turns and\\n     scrambles back up the ladder.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL\\n\\n     Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up.\\n     At length, he regains control of himself.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE - AT LIGHT SPEED\\n\\n     The SNARK appears to hang motionless, with planets and star clusters\\n     rolling past in the infinite distance.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - BRIDGE\\n\\n     Roby is putting the cat into a metal, vacuum-sealed catbox, with a\\n     little oxygen tank on it.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               Kitty go bye-bye.\\n\\n     He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen.  There is a faint hiss\\n     of pressurized air.  Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in\\n     front.  It YOWLS.\\n\\n     He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY\\n\\n     Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the\\n     flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal\\n     cannisters.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (reading from labels)\\n               What\\'ll it be, Kitty?

Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one\\n     by one.\\n\\n     A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

The thing can\\n     be heard fumbling around in the passageway.\\n\\n     Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding\\n     down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the\\n     ship as he sprints for the engine room.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

The room is full of\\n     smoke and the engines are whining dangerously.  It is extremely hot in\\n     the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.\\n\\n     He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit\\n     switches.\\n\\n     Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

He turns and runs from the\\n     engine room.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP\\n\\n     Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time\\n     up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:\\n\\n                              COMPUTER\\n               Attention!

Engines will explode in\\n               60 seconds!\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and\\n     does a dive over the back of the control chair.  He is no sooner in the\\n     seat than he hits the \"LAUNCH\" button.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE\\n     LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE \"SNARK.\"\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates\\n     away from the mother ship.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of\\n     the SNARK.  The scene is strangely serene for such deadly\\n     circumstances.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the\\n     catbox.  The cat is YOWLING.  Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches\\n     his head down over it.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind,\\n     until it is barely a point of light.\\n\\n     THEN IT BLOWS UP.\\n\\n     AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL\\n     DIRECTIONS.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling\\n     everything inside.  Then all is quiet.\\n\\n     Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of\\n     the lifeboat.  He stares out through the porthole.  His face is bathed\\n     in orange light.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - SPACE\\n\\n     What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away\\n     into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby\\'s expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of\\n     his ship and friends.\\n\\n     BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN\\n     INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.\\n\\n     The cat SCREECHES.\\n\\n     Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of\\n     the boat.  It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man\\'s arm.\\n\\n     It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.\\n\\n     His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on\\n     the floor right next to the monster.  Next he glances around for any\\n     place to hide.  His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit,\\n     with the door standing open.\\n\\n     He begins to edge toward the locker.  The creature rises.  He freezes.\\n\\n     It throws down the arm.  With that, Roby dives for the open locker\\n     door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face\\n     right up to the glass, peering in at Roby.  The locker is so small that\\n     Roby\\'s face is only inches away from the creature\\'s.  The sight is\\n     disgusting.  It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.\\n\\n     Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits.  It\\n     bends down and peers inside.  The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.\\n\\n     It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE\\n     GLASS.\\n\\n     But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the\\n     glass, startling the hell out of Roby.\\n\\n     Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the\\n     catbox.\\n\\n     Roby looks around.  He spies the spacesuit.  Quickly, he begins to pull\\n     it on.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see\\n     if there is anything inside.  The cat MOANS.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature throws the catbox down.  It clangs, and bounces.  The thing\\n     picks it up again and hammers it against the wall.  Then it jams it\\n     into a crevice in the wall.\\n\\n     With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the\\n     crevice.  The cat has gone beyond hysterics.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n     Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the\\n     oxygen.  With a hiss, the suit fills itself.\\n\\n     In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip.\\n     Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.\\n\\n     Again he raps on the glass.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature turns.  It faces the locker, peers at him.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n               Try a little of this, you fucking\\n               bastard.\\n\\n     HE KICKS THE DOOR OPEN.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT\\n     THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.\\n\\n     IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR.  The yellow acid\\n     begins to flow from the wound.\\n\\n     Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a\\n     switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.\\n\\n     In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into\\n     space -- and the bleeding creature along with it.  Roby grabs a steel\\n     strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT\\n     WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.\\n\\n   \\n\\n   \\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing\\n     clinging to his leg.  He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won\\'t\\n     let go.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and\\n     yanks it.\\n\\n     The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END\\n     OF THE CREATURE\\'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.\\n\\n     It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming,\\n     the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is\\n     starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.\\n\\n     Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:\\n\\n                              \"RAM JETS\"\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the\\n     creature is wriggling.  THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN\\n     SHUT OFF.\\n\\n     INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT\\n\\n     Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a\\n     writhing, smoking, foaming mass.\\n\\n     As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats --\\n     then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all\\n     directions.  The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling\\n     into infinity.\\n\\n                                                            DISSOLVE TO:\\n\\n     INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT - LATER\\n\\n     The boat is re-pressurized and Roby is seated in the control chair.  He\\n     seems calm and composed, almost cheerful.  The cat purrs in his lap.\\n\\n                              ROBY\\n                    (dictating)\\n               ... So it looks like I\\'ll make it\\n               back to the Colonies on schedule\\n               after all.  I should be to the\\n               frontier in another 250 years or so,\\n               and then with a little luck the\\n               network will pick me up.  I\\'m not as\\n               rich as I was a couple days ago --\\n               but I\\'m not exactly broke either.\\n               Incidentally, I did manage to\\n               salvage one souvenir out of this\\n               whole mess.\\n\\n     He reaches down into the carrying bag he brought on board, and pulls\\n     out the ALIEN SKULL.\\n\\n                              ROBY (CONT\\'D)\\n               Poor Yorick here should go at least\\n               partway toward proving I\\'m not a\\n               crank.  I wish it was him we\\'d met in\\n               the first place -- things might have\\n               turned out different.\\n\\n     He puts the skull down on a shelf and locks a glass lid over it.\\n\\n                              ROBY (CONT\\'D)\\n               This is Martin Roby, executive\\n               officer, last survivor of the\\n               commercial vessel SNARK, signing off.\\n               Come on, cat, let\\'s go to sleep.\\n\\n     Roby leans forward and switches off the recorder.  Then he rises and,\\n     carrying the cat, walks to the hypersleep freezer, which stands open.\\n\\n     He climbs in and stretches out on his back, holding the cat against\\n     his chest.  With one hand, he presses a switch, and THE LID CLOSES OVER\\n     HIM.\\n\\n     CLOSE-UP OF THE ALIEN SKULL, watching sentinel over the slumbering\\n     Roby like some dead, melancholy pixie.\\n\\n     EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE\\n\\n     The lifeboat -- SNARK 2 -- sails away toward its rendezvous with Irth,\\n     250 years from now.\\n\\n     As SNARK 2 drifts past camera, we suddenly see that A SPORE POD IS\\n     ADHERED TO THE UNDERBELLY OF THE CRAFT.\\n\\n     ROLL END TITLES & MUSIC.\\n\\n                              THE END\\n\\n\\n\\n   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlien\\nWriters : \\xa0\\xa0Walter Hill\\xa0\\xa0David Giler\\nGenres : \\xa0\\xa0Action\\xa0\\xa0Horror\\xa0\\xa0Sci-Fi\\xa0\\xa0Thriller\\nUser Comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBack to IMSDb\\n\\n\\n'"
