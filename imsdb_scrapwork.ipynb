To people complaining about the script not being accurate, hit the back button a bit and you'll see written next to it 'DRAFT' in big letters. This means that this isn't the script you see on screen. You get a TRANSCRIPT, which is a copy of what happens on screen, and you get a SCRIPT, which is either a draft, and how it relates to the movie depends on how early in production it was-which is why we're given DATES.\r\n",

An easy script, an easy film to watch. No difficult concepts! Based on the Taming of the Shrew by Shakespeare - interesting to connect the characters in the film with the characters in the play. The script is not *wrong* - it is just an early draft without the directors alterations and actors improvisations. The director of the film will cut out scenes and change dialogue to suit their means, actors will improvise on camera (around their lines). So the script is not going to be EXACTLY the same.</p><hr><p><b>monti</b> <img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>This movie is one of my all time favs! I love it so much.

Heath Ledger is good in it; and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is very sweet. Bianca is annoying, but Katarina is a fascinating character.</p><hr><p><b>OK</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>I prefer some of the dialogue in this script to that of the film. It's somehow more enjoyable. I was surprised to read the change in Ms. Perky's line! In a good way. She was probably my favourite character in the movie. 10 Things was just a typical movie. Typical, typical, typical. Some things were different to usual teen romance movies, but not much. Too predictable and safe. I found it rather boring and wasn't swayed as I should have been in the film. For instance, in the end scene with the poem I burst out laughing because it just wasn't believable. Lame movie, but not the worst.</p><hr><p><b>Jacobb</b> <a href=\"mailto:chapJ99@yahoo.com\" title=\"E-mail User\"><img src=\"/images/emailuser.gif\" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I'm a big fan of this movie. I've seen it over a thousand times and I don't remember seeing a lot of these scenes in the movie. The ending in the movie was when the guy bought Kat a guitar and they kissed. A band was playing on the roof of the school. They must have deleted some of the scenes in the screenplay and added some, but I'm not too sure. The movie is great, I love the drama and romance. I write screenplays similarto this, but I'm inspired by George Lucas and John Hughes. This is a great screenplay, I'm looking forward to reading more of the writer(s) work and hopefully my writing can compare to it. I'm a beginner at writing screenplays, and this screenplay made me want to keep on writing. It's great! Keep up the work! Is there a way that I can submit my screenplays on this website?</p><hr><p><b>Ryno</b> <img src=/images/rating/5-stars.gif> (5 out of 10 )<br>Reading the script, I couldn't believe that the actors read it and thought that this is a great script (I know that this is only a draft script).  My opinion is that the actors actually made the movie.  The actors in the movie was much cooler than the characters portrayed in the script.\r\n",

I think that the finalized translation to screen was much better and being an aspiring screenwriter it gives me hope that if something as average/simple as this can be made into a big budget film then maybe my stuff can too. My rating is for the script here, not the movie.</p><hr><p><b>Emma</b> <a href=\"mailto:emmapolarbear@gmail.com\" title=\"E-mail User\"><img src=\"/images/emailuser.gif\" border=0></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/images/rating/10-stars.gif> (10 out of 10 )<br>I love this movie so much I have watched so many times at school and home.
