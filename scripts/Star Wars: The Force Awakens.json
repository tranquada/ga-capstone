In his absence,\r\n           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the\r\n           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until\r\n           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.\r\n           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General\r\n           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is\r\n           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain\r\n           his help in restoring peace and justice to\r\n           the galaxy.\r\n\r\n           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret\r\n           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has\r\n           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....\r\n\r\n\r\n          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is\r\n          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --\r\n          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the\r\n          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a\r\n          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant\r\n          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...\r\n\r\n          CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the\r\n          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an\r\n          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER\r\n          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.\r\n\r\n          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We\r\n\r\n                         ARE IN:\r\n\r\n          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to\r\n          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A\r\n          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster\r\n          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING\r\n\r\n                         QUIET:\r\n\r\n          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of\r\n          native animals. A single wind chime.\r\n          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,\r\n          orange and white, this is BB-8.\r\n          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE\r\n          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO\r\n          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND\r\n\r\n          ROLLS OFF FAST --\r\n\r\n          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.\r\n          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.\r\n          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,\r\n          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in\r\n          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           This will begin to make things right.\r\n           I've traveled too far, and seen too\r\n           much, to ignore the despair in the\r\n           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can\r\n           be no balance in the Force.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n           Well, because of you now we have a\r\n           chance. The General's been after\r\n           this for a long time.\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           \"The General.\" To me, she's royalty.\r\n           Well, she certainly is that.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San\r\n          Tekka.\r\n\r\n                          POE (CONT'D)\r\n           We've got company.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.\r\n          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.\r\n          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A\r\n\r\n          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n           You have to hide.\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           You have to leave. Go!\r\n          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.\r\n          BB-8 follows.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,\r\n          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers\r\n          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many\r\n          are HIT!\r\n\r\n          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the\r\n          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!\r\n          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he\r\n          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the\r\n          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES\r\n\r\n          IN THE DISTANCE.\r\n          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.\r\n          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!\r\n          But just then:\r\n          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to\r\n          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!\r\n\r\n                          POE (CONT'D)\r\n           I see 'em!\r\n          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT\r\n          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!\r\n          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!\r\n          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.\r\n          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the\r\n          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.\r\n          They're in trouble.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS\r\n          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering\r\n          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from\r\n          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into\r\n          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n           You take this. It's safer with you\r\n           than it is with me. You get as far\r\n           away from here as you can. Do you\r\n           hear me?\r\n           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)\r\n           I'll come back for you! It will be\r\n           alright.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns\r\n          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS\r\n          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers\r\n          from cover.\r\n\r\n          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is\r\n          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.\r\n          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN\r\n          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD\r\n          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by\r\n          the battle.\r\n\r\n          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --\r\n\r\n          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.\r\n          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,\r\n          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides\r\n          through the chaos toward San Tekka.\r\n          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders\r\n\r\n                         HIM:\r\n\r\n                          SENIOR TROOPER\r\n           Stay here.\r\n          Our Trooper nods.\r\n          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing\r\n          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a\r\n          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.\r\n\r\n                          KYLO REN\r\n           Look how old you've become.\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           Something far worse has happened to\r\n           you.\r\n          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other\r\n          stormtroopers.\r\n\r\n                          KYLO REN\r\n           You know what I've come for.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           I know where you come from. Before\r\n           you called yourself Kylo Ren.\r\n\r\n                          KYLO REN\r\n           The map to Skywalker. We know you've\r\n           found it, and now you're going to\r\n           give it to the First Order.\r\n          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San\r\n          Tekka exchange continue.\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           The First Order rose from the dark\r\n           side... you did not.\r\n\r\n                          KYLO REN\r\n           I'll show you the dark side.\r\n\r\n           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n           You may try, but you cannot deny the\r\n           truth that is your family.\r\n          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --\r\n\r\n          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --\r\n\r\n          YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --\r\n\r\n                          KYLO REN\r\n           You're so right.\r\n          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!\r\n          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES\r\n          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:\r\n          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT\r\n\r\n          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!\r\n          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.\r\n          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the\r\n          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.\r\n          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves\r\n          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's\r\n          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.\r\n          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.\r\n\r\n                          POE\r\n           So who talks first?

Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows\r\n          he's doomed.\r\n          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,\r\n          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,\r\n          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS\r\n          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are\r\n          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a\r\n          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.\r\n          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,\r\n          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:\r\n\r\n          INT.

JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles\r\n          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young\r\n          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.\r\n          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into\r\n          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for\r\n          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:\r\n          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC\r\n\r\n          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND\r\n          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of\r\n          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.\r\n          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG\r\n          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant\r\n          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS.

Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the\r\n          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from\r\n          her speeder toward the town.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY\r\n\r\n          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.\r\n          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning\r\n          some salvage.\r\n          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,\r\n          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another\r\n          language. She returns to work.\r\n\r\n          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind\r\n          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,\r\n          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:\r\n\r\n                          UNKAR\r\n           What you've brought me today is\r\n           worth... Hmmm... One quarter\r\n           portion.\r\n          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.\r\n          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:\r\n          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.\r\n          She takes it.\r\n          She swallows her resentment and heads off.\r\n\r\n          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY\r\n\r\n          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's\r\n          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.\r\n\r\n          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY\r\n\r\n          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;\r\n          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.\r\n          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE\r\n          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks\r\n          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.\r\n          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.\r\n          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the\r\n          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT\r\n          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs\r\n          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old\r\n          plate. Grabs the loaf.\r\n\r\n          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.\r\n          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single\r\n          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She\r\n          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n          CONTINUED: just 'cause.\r\n          Puts it on,\r\n          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of\r\n          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.\r\n          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,\r\n          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING\r\n          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.\r\n          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in\r\n          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,\r\n          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo\r\n          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.\r\n          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:\r\n\r\n                          REY\r\n           Tal'ama parqual!\r\n          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.\r\n\r\n                          REY (CONT'D)\r\n           Parqual zatana!\r\n          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.\r\n          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching\r\n          a tennis match.\r\n          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.\r\n          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks\r\n          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and\r\n          says, fiercely:\r\n\r\n                          REY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n           NOMA.\r\n          The Teedo barks a sort of \"AHHHHH!\" (As if to say, \"GO TO\r\n          HELL!\"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to\r\n          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.\r\n\r\n                          REY (CONT'D)\r\n           Shhhh.\r\n          BB-8 quiets instantly.

That he is alone, scared, has no one else.\r\n          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking\r\n          him.

One\r\n          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts\r\n          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8\r\n          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS\r\n          OVER METAL URNS for sale --\r\n          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He\r\n          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS\r\n          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.\r\n          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --\r\n          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and\r\n          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as\r\n          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.\r\n          Finn just watches, stunned.\r\n          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.\r\n          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!\r\n          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...\r\n          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy.

Frustrated, but sighs\r\n          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard\r\n          decision: to tell the truth.\r\n\r\n                          FINN\r\n           It belonged to Poe Dameron.

She follows the sound into\r\n          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked\r\n          back at her one last time.\r\n\r\n          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows\r\n          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why\r\n          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young\r\n          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,\r\n          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION\r\n          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE\r\n\r\n          DOOR OPENS.\r\n          Hesitant, Rey enters.\r\n\r\n          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old\r\n          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something\r\n          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.\r\n          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside\r\n          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.\r\n          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment\r\n          heavy with tension.\r\n          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original\r\n          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but\r\n          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there\r\n          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves\r\n          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.\r\n          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her\r\n          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD\r\n          CITY.

We PAN to:\r\n          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,\r\n          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches\r\n          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.\r\n          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --\r\n          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --\r\n          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A\r\n          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we\r\n          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime\r\n          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she\r\n          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six\r\n          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!\r\n          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and\r\n          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --\r\n          and see...\r\n          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.\r\n          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm.

Rey looks around\r\n          her to see she is..\r\n          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,\r\n          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath\r\n          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING\r\n          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.\r\n          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND\r\n          A TREE!

We've got a\r\n           heartbeat.\r\n          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.\r\n          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.\r\n          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.\r\n          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's\r\n          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.\r\n          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.\r\n          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Excuse me, General?\r\n          Leia turns to see droids.\r\n\r\n           C-3PO (CONT'D)\r\n           R2-D2 may contain some much needed\r\n           good news.\r\n\r\n                          LEIA\r\n           Tell me.\r\n          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of\r\n          Resistance Officers.

Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she\r\n          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,\r\n          despite her fear:\r\n\r\n                          REY\r\n           We'll see each other again. I believe\r\n           that. Thank you, my friend.\r\n\r\n          EXT. D'QAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands\r\n          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As\r\n          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:\r\n\r\n                          LEIA\r\n           Rey.\r\n          Rey turns around.\r\n\r\n                          LEIA (CONT'D)\r\n           May the Force be with you.\r\n          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to\r\n          the Falcon.\r\n\r\n          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot.

Endless BLUE, dotted with\r\n          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted\r\n          with countless GREEN TREES.\r\n          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of\r\n          the ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the\r\n          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,\r\n          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath\r\n          and Rey continues her journey.\r\n\r\n          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY\r\n\r\n          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are\r\n          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to\r\n          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.\r\n\r\n          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone\r\n          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,\r\n          senses no one.\r\n\r\n          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.\r\n          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,\r\n          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.\r\n\r\n          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares\r\n          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,\r\n          to her. Pulls back his hood.\r\n\r\n          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.\r\n\r\n          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness\r\n          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't\r\n          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His\r\n          look says it all.\r\n\r\n          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.\r\n\r\n          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.\r\n          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's\r\n          only hope.\r\n\r\n          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and\r\n          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise\r\n          of an adventure, just beginning...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          THE END\r\n\n\n\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Lawrence Kasdan\u00a0\u00a0J.J.
