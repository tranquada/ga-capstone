In his absence,\r\n           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the\r\n           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until\r\n           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.\r\n           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General\r\n           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE.

A RUMBLING is\r\n          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --\r\n          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the\r\n          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a\r\n          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant\r\n          planet. Jakku.

Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an\r\n          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER\r\n          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.\r\n\r\n          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT.

He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE\r\n          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried.

Another OLDER HAND covers it.\r\n          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,\r\n          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in\r\n          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:\r\n\r\n<b>           LOR SAN TEKKA\r\n</b>           This will begin to make things right.\r\n           I've traveled too far, and seen too\r\n           much, to ignore the despair in the\r\n           galaxy.

BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns\r\n          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS\r\n          AWAY.

With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but\r\n          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there\r\n          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves\r\n          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.\r\n          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her\r\n          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD\r\n          CITY.
