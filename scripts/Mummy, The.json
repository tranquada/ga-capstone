All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests \n               squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.\n\n               His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.\n\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         As for me, I was condemned to endure \n                         the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient \n                         curses. One so horrible, it had never \n                         before been bestowed.\n\n               Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's \n               TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on \n               top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is \n               apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue \n               onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.\n\n               Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and \n               fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus \n               muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the \n               fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.\n\n               He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.\n\n               An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.\n\n               Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the \n               bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting \n               dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.\n\n               Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.\n\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         By eating the sacred scarabs, I would \n                         be cursed to stay alive forever. And \n                         by eating me, they were cursed just \n                         the same.\n\n               The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange \n               four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.\n\n               The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a \n               loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia \n               uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.\n\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         I was to remain sealed inside my \n                         sarcophagus, the undead for all of \n                         eternity.\n\n               The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses \n               the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle \n<b>               BOX.\n</b>\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         They would never allow me to be \n                         released.

The \n               disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and \n               then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.\n\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         And if I could raise my beloved Anck-\n                         su-namun from her place in hell, \n                         together, we would be an unstoppable \n                         infection upon this world. The \n                         Apocalypse. The End.\n\n               Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming \n               from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt \n               onto it.

The \n               sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the \n               sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Filled with literature on the \n               Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between \n               two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves, \n               is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in- \n               a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.\n\n               This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with \n               her.\n\n               Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows \n               the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books \n               whose titles all begin with the letter \"O\". Then she grabs \n               another book out from under her arm and reads the title.\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up \n                         here?\n\n               Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her \n               shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles \n               begin with the letter \"T\". Then she looks down. It's a long \n               way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down \n               on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach \n               across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too \n               far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder \n               with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.\n\n               And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn \n               YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the \n               ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath, \n               swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her \n               balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts \n               stiltwalking down the aisle.\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b><b>                         OHEIUGM!! AHHHHHH!\n</b>\n               The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads \n               back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling \n               for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and \n               picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into \n               another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a \n               bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.\n\n               And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES \n               into the next bookshelf.\n\n               Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She \n               looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf \n               crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after \n               bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and \n               scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last \n               shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She \n               opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other \n               eye and stares at the huge mess.\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Oops.\n\n               The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.\n\n<b>                                     CURATOR\n</b>                         Look at this!

She \n               walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases \n               of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this \n               one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks \n               around to see who could have opened it.

Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE \n               IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook.

Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS \n               gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as \n               they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill \n               multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps \n               SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.\n\n               O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni, \n               who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         Goin' somewhere?\n\n<b>                                     BENI\n</b>                         Just looking for you, O'Connell!

O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks, \n               LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to \n               the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point \n               blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell \n               is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.\n\n               A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off, \n               misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider \n               off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.\n\n               Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly, \n               she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.\n\n               A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly \n               backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises \n               his scimitar, about to strike.\n\n               Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant \n               gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS \n               him twenty feet back into some ruins.\n\n               At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and \n               over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand \n               dune.\n\n               Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the \n               temple door.

Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around \n               and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.\n\n               O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something \n               THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray \n               on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises \n               his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!\n\n               Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed, \n               O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick \n               of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It \n               IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two \n               men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray \n               points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.\n\n<b>                                     ARDETH RAY\n</b><b>                         LEAVE THIS PLACE!...

O'Connell watches them leave, \n               then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn \n               staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her \n               and holds her close.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         You alright?\n\n               Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes.

Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for \n               Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.\n\n               And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses \n               himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks.

O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them \n               overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car, \n               CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before \n               they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He \n               TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a \n               corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing \n               several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK! \n               CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like \n               rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.\n\n               The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them \n               and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down \n               his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket, \n               and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He \n               holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through \n               his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.\n\n               WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased \n               mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...\n\n<b>               INT./EXT.

Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.\n\n               All of them staring out the front windshield.

Jonathan hits the gas, loses \n               control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         C'mon!

O'Connell quickly reaches into his \n               gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into \n               his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way \n               to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth \n               Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the \n               lit match near the fuse.\n\n               The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring \n               at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.\n\n               And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated, \n               he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did \n               the day he was buried alive.

He \n               YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it \n               across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives \n               O'Connell a look to kill.

The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the \n               stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward \n               and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on \n               Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.\n\n<b>                                     IMHOTEP\n</b>                         Koontash dai na.\n\n               Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.\n\n<b>                                     BENI\n</b>                         Take his hand and he will spare the \n                         others.\n\n               Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty \n               crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars, \n               waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident, \n               powerful, invincible.

It hits him like lightning --\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         We need the key!\n\n               Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain \n               around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket \n               He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         What do I do, Evy!?

Evelyn now \n               has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell \n               force him back.\n\n               Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription, \n               but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Keetash-something, naraba-something.\n\n               Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching \n               the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?\n\n               Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.\n\n               O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding \n               Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!\n\n               Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.\n\n               And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES \n               through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.\n\n               The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares \n               angrily down. Jonathan stares back.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Oh boy.\n\n               O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         This just keeps gettin, better and \n                         better.\n\n               Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.\n\n               O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword, \n               frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack, \n               forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to \n               head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her \n               around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.\n\n               Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in \n               ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for \n               O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus \n               moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         Do something, Jonathan!

Evelyn fends her off as best \n               she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on \n               the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Ummm, Hootash im...

The statue of Anubis \n               corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's \n               MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares \n               at the inscription, slightly oblivious.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         It's an Anck symbol, with two little \n                         squiggly lines above it, and a bird, \n                         a stork! on either side.\n\n               Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Ah!

It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell \n               slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away, \n               Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream \n               just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to \n               powder and DRIVING her into the ground.\n\n               Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily \n               heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly \n               backpedals on his hands and heels.\n\n               O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for \n               Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden \n               Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.\n\n               O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!\n\n               SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still \n               clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and \n               spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         Okay pal, let's see how tough you \n                         are without your right arm.\n\n               Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him \n               half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a \n               gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes \n               it off.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         Alright,... so he's left handed.\n\n               Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up \n               his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         I got it!\n\n               Evelyn runs for Jonathan.\n\n               O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten \n               flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep \n               looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.\n\n               Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.\n\n               O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS \n               him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,\n\n               SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage \n               in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS \n               into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in \n               the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with \n               him.\n\n               He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.\n\n               Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.\n\n               Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed \n               hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn \n               yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working \n               the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.\n\n               Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum, \n               swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES \n               through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.\n\n               No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and \n               casually flings it away.\n\n               The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan \n               holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages \n               looking for something.\n\n               O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat \n               and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed \n               mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, \n               then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About \n               to die.\n\n               Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos! \n<b>                         PARED OOS!!\n</b>\n               Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror \n               on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which \n               starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.\n\n               And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out \n               of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The \n               mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits \n               attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.\n\n               Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits, \n               Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of \n               The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden \n               book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like \n               he's about to cry.\n\n               Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's \n               body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.\n\n               Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the \n               beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One \n               last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep \n               is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet, \n               he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.\n\n               O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword \n               scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across \n               Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the \n               blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.\n\n               O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him \n               backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus \n               bog. The sword still in his stomach.\n\n               Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as \n               Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And \n               then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at \n               them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.\n\n               Evelyn translates:\n\n<b>                                     EVELYN\n</b>                         Death is only the beginning.\n\n               Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.\n\n<b>               STAFF CHAMBER - DAY\n</b>\n               Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight \n               of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large, \n               ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag \n               over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.\n\n               A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF \n               DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.\n\n               Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.\n\n               ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons \n               of pouring sand.

TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY\n</b>\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure \n               chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the \n               treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again \n               and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards \n               a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of \n               the sinking walls is deafening.\n\n               Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn \n               and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a \n               staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already \n               half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet \n               high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.\n\n               Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives, \n               but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.\n\n               O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of \n               time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --\n\n<b>                                     BENI\n</b><b>                         O'CONNELL!!\n</b>\n               O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand \n               back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.\n\n               Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as \n               the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks \n               around with his diminishing torch.\n\n               All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's \n               trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over \n               in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.\n\n               Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.\n\n<b>                                     BENI\n</b>                         Go away.\n\n               He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens \n               upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.\n\n               Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.\n\n               And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.\n\n               And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.\n\n               And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.\n\n<b>               EXT.

PLATEAU - DAY\n</b>\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the \n               plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the \n               sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.\n\n<b>                                     JONATHAN\n</b>                         Well,... I guess we go home empty \n                         handed.\n\n               O'Connell looks at Evelyn.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL\n</b>                         Wouldn't say that.\n\n               Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms \n               around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.\n\n               Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs \n               up onto a camel.\n\n               When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile, \n               then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs \n               Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her \n               arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.\n\n<b>                                     O'CONNELL/JONATHAN\n</b><b>                         TUK-TUK-TUK!!\n</b>\n               The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag \n               behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can \n               see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.\n\n               O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Mummy, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Nina Wilcox Putnam\" title=\"Scripts by Nina Wilcox Putnam\">Nina Wilcox Putnam</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Richard Schayer\" title=\"Scripts by Richard Schayer\">Richard Schayer</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=John L.
