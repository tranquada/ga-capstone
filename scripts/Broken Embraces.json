Immediately following, the building goes\n          dark.\n\n          Establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower, lit.

All these well-\n          known architectonic wonders turn dark, abruptly. (Beauty that\n          disappears suddenly, beauty that's extinguished and envelops us in\n          darkness.)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          1. HARRY CAINE'S HOME. INT. NIGHT.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry (fifty years old) sits, as if he were waiting, without hurry,\n          immobile and patient in his study next to his desk, as if it were the\n          thing keeping him company. He isn't doing anything. He lets time\n          take its course. His silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that\n          come and go. At first we can't see who the footsteps belong to, until\n          they stop.\n\n          In the living room, a few meters from Harry, Judit stops. She, too,\n          is shrouded in darkness. She looks at her wristwatch, the second hand\n          moves from left to right on the watch face. Judit (forty-eight, looks\n          younger) breathes, impatient. (She is dressed soberly, in a dignified\n          and practical manner).\n\n          \n\n          \n          She approaches a window that looks out onto the street. Everything\n          outside is also in darkness. The building in front is just a dark\n          mass. She looks to the end of the street. Almost all the buildings\n          visible from the window are dark, the Gate of Alcala in the background\n          is also not lit. Without turning, she says to Harry:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           The Door of Alcala has also darkened.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry is still sitting, inert, absorbed by his thoughts. The whole\n          house is in darkness, only the ambient clarity of the night comes\n          through the windows, curtains drawn back.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           3\n\n          \n          Judit heads slowly toward the kitchen. On the wall there is a Vitra\n          clock, to which she gives a cursory glance.\n          She turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water. From her pocket,\n          she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in\n          silver. She opens it. She grabs a small pink pill. She takes it.\n          She glances once more at the stylized design of the Vitra clock. The\n          minute hand nears 8 p.m.\n          On a windowsill (or on the kitchen table) there is an open newspaper.\n          The exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global\n          warming. An international date has been convened for a five minute\n          blackout at 8 p.m.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Standing in the kitchen, Judit, poised and tense, looks up at the spot\n          where the clock is. The stillness of all the elements comprising the\n          frame make it seem like a painting. She waits until the seconds hand\n          completes its cycle and it's 8 o'clock sharp.\n          Swiftly, Judit powers the central electrical switchboard, which is in\n          the kitchen. The kitchen lights up, the refrigerator emits its\n          characteristic sound. The lamps in the living room also light up.\n          (Low-hanging lamps that make the light bounce. The house is awash in\n          a special luminous atmosphere \u00ad dense, translucent, with darkened\n          zones). All the furniture is flush with the walls. There are some\n          paintings hanging and a rug on the ground, everything is of the kind\n          of quality that denotes good personal taste.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Upon the light's return, Judit exhales a profound sigh of relief.\n          She moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and\n          contemplates how, in the building across the way, the windows begin to\n          blink, in square patterns of light.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2. FLASHBACK. 1994. LANZAROTE HOSPITAL. INT. DAY.\n\n\n           4\n\n          \n          The light's return is contagious, a true spectacle, which ends with a\n          blinding light that floods the screen.\n          It will probably be a close-up of the sun.\n\n          \n\n          \n          That very sun enters through another window, which is not that of\n          Harry's house, nor that of the building across the way. It is the\n          window of a hospital room (perhaps a sign should specify that the\n          following scene occurs \"Fourteen years earlier\")\n\n          \n\n          \n          The hospital is on Lanzarote Island, in the Canary Islands. The scene\n          occurs fourteen years earlier. The characters are the same. Harry\n          and Judit.\n          Harry lies in bed, his head completely bandaged. Sunlight enters\n          through the window.\n          Judit is seated on the bed. She holds his hand and pleads, worried\n          and loving:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Mateo, say something!\n\n           MATEO-HARRY\n           Mateo is dead.\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Sweet and devastated) Don't say that!\n\n          \n\n          \n          The character to whom Judit refers as Mateo, (the same one that in the\n          previous scene we have called Harry), has a recent wound, either on\n          his arm or on his hands, along with his head, which is completely\n          covered by bandages.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo and Harry are the same person, the difference is the fourteen\n          years that separate them. Harry, in the present (2008), is fifty\n\n           5\n\n          \n          years old. In `94, the time period when the flashback takes place, he\n          was thirty-six. Let's say that when he was thirty-six, Harry was\n          called Mateo. The character has two names, which his own voice-off\n          explains, while we observe what his day-to-day consists of in 2008.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           OFF HARRY\n           I always wanted to be another person, to be someone\n           beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn't\n           seem enough. Living a single life wasn't enough for\n           me. And half-joking, I came up with a pseudonym for\n           myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would\n           have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him\n           author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I\n           came up with a standard biography to fill the back\n           flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an\n           industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a\n           boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A\n           self-made man, active and attractive like an English\n           spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years,\n           Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person,\n           me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't\n           be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my\n           pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror,\n           we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled,\n           reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not\n           reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one\n           left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and,\n           never better stated, a self-made man, one might even\n           say, \"self-written man\". There was only one detail I\n           had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           6\n\n          \n\n          3. IMAGES THAT ACCOMPANY THE VOICE -OFF. HARRY CAINE'S DAILY\n\n          RITUALS.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Despite his fifty years and his blindness, Harry is a man that keeps\n          himself in great physical shape.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry's Home. Interior. Day.\n\n          \n\n          \n          In the morning: he places a CD in a player. By himself, he selects\n          and starts the program on a treadmill. He steps on and begins\n          exercising.\n          He takes a shower (\"Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same\n          person, me, but a time came when, all of a sudden...\"), the camera\n          pans over various parts of his body under the running water, dense\n          waves of white foam slide down his skin, as if it was a landscape.\n          The hangers have Braille-stickers that indicate the characteristic of\n          the clothing they hold. (All the closets have sliding doors)\n          In his bedroom, he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will\n          wear. Despite the fact that he cannot see himself, he stands in front\n          of a mirror. He smiles, pleased with his appearance .\n          Everything in the house is rigorously ordered. All that Harry needs\n          to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch.\n          He exits onto the street.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4. HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry traverses (aided by an umbrella?) the pedestrian crossing. When\n          he reaches the opposite sidewalk, the credits appear on the black and\n          white stripes that mark the crossing. The crossway is clear of\n          pedestrians so that only cars pass through (not many) and as they do,\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           7\n\n          \n          they run over the letters of the credits, making them disappear, in\n          pieces. On a different stripe, a new title appears and as it does, it\n          is run over and destroyed by another car. Like this, successively.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5. SIDEWALK ACROSS FROM HARRY'S BUILDING. EXT. DAY.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Just on the sidewalk across from where Harry lives, there is a news-\n          stand, and next to it, perhaps on the nearest corner, a bar.\n          Harry buys the newspaper at the news-stand. This is part of his daily\n          routine. He greets the attendant familiarly. He has the kind of face\n          that provokes pity. He grabs the newspaper, folds it, and places it\n          under his arm.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6. BAR ACROSS THE WAY. INT. DAY.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          He enters the bar. He leans down somewhere on the bar table. Just as\n          soon as he sees him, he is approached by his Waiter Friend, an\n          approachable guy, somewhere in his forties, who is helped by a South\n          American waitress, wearing her makeup since the early part of the\n          morning, whom he is obviously screwing. He brings him a coffee. All\n          of these actions are part of a daily ritual.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           WAITER FRIEND\n           Do you want me to read you something from the\n           newspaper?\n\n           HARRY\n           No, thanks. I am off on a stroll.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           8\n\n          \n\n          RETURN TO SEC. 5\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry exits the bar and becomes immersed in the different noises of\n          the street, the passersby, their different sounds and corporeal odors.\n          Auditory life. The camera swirls around his head. At first he hears\n          all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate\n          them. He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street\n          disappear or their volume is lowered. Girls, cars, high heels, the\n          smells of different ethnicities. A multi-racial street. Harry\n          selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and\n          disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of\n          her heels. He loses them. He finds them again.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban\n          furniture or the people. He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he\n          uses as a cane. At first glance he doesn't appear blind ...\n\n          \n\n          \n          He reaches a pedestrian crossing. Nearby, he recognizes the odor\n          which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the\n          sidewalk. The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him,\n          waiting before the crosswalk. Harry searches with the tip of the\n          umbrella, until he brushes her shoe. He excuses himself, as if the\n          contact had been inadvertent. The girl regards him. Harry then takes\n          one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very\n          close to him, almost running him over. (A real sense of danger). The\n          light is red for pedestrians. The Girl takes him by the arm, pulling\n          him toward her, frightened.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           GIRL\n           (Alarmed) Watch out! You can't cross!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           9\n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Sorry . . .\n\n           GIRL\n           I'll tell you when!\n\n           HARRY\n           Thank you very much.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7. MATEO-HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          They make it through the crosswalk. She is not holding his arm (but\n          almost), Harry doesn't need it. He knows the surroundings well.\n          They reach the other sidewalk.\n          Harry thanks her for her help, the Girl observes him the entire time,\n          intrigued and curious.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I live nearby, two blocks up, would you mind coming along\n           with me?\n\n          \n\n          \n          The Girl accepts, delighted. Tall, thin, attractive, modern, and\n          inexpressive like a model, this is what the Girl is like.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          8. CONTINUED. BUILDING'S ENTRANCE. EXT. DAY.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Once at the entrance, Harry invites her to come up so that she can\n          read aloud the newspaper to him. The Girl checks her watch, and ends\n          up accepting.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           GIRL\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           10\n\n          \n           But I warn you, I've never read out-loud, you may not\n           like it!\n\n           HARRY\n           You will only have to browse.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          9. LIVING ROOM, MATEO'S HOME. INT. DAY.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The same living room we've seen in Sequence 1.

She turns a\n          few pages and stops.

What are you like? Do you\n           mind describing yourself?\n\n          \n\n          \n          The girl begins to describe herself, at first a little tentative.\n          (Her measurements? She smiles. She knows them by heart.)\n          She describes herself. The color of her eyes. Her hair. Her skin.\n          How she's dressed, while she traces over him with her glance (When she\n          speaks of her eyes, we see his eyes; when she speaks of her mouth, we\n          see his, etc). Her gaze stops at Harry's crotch. Harry can feel her\n          watching him. The situation seems perfectly natural.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry approaches her (he knows she's right in front of him). With his\n          hands, he places a brief caress on each of the parts the Girl has just\n          described. The eyes, the hair, the mouth. He lowers his hands until\n          they fall, spread, on her breasts. It is as though the blind man\n          could gaze at her with his fingers and palms. He rests his head on\n          the Girl's breast, pulls down her bra straps and he begins to savor\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           12\n\n          \n          her breasts, delicately. Harry's cell phone rings, but he ignores it,\n          doesn't pick up.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          10.

Half-naked, with some of her clothes in her hand, the Girl\n          heads for the bathroom. Harry, still sitting on the same sofa, begins\n          to dress and to smooth down his clothes, without hurry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          11. CONTINUED.

Immediately following, the key\n          is inserted into the keyhole, from the outside.\n          Someone is opening it.\n          Harry rises. Before he arrives to the foyer, the door is already\n          open. In the middle of the doorway, a woman, Judit (the same one who\n          had been with him during the blackout of the opening sequence).\n          Harry finishes tucking his shirt, barefoot. Judit closes the door\n          slowly and surveys him up and down with inquisitive eyes, which he\n          cannot see but one could say that he can guess. He smiles.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           What are you laughing at?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           13\n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I am only smiling, because of the way you're looking\n           at me.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The sound of a running faucet emerging from the bathroom distracts\n          Judit; first the sound, then the immediate appearance of the Girl.\n          Both women look at each other and are surprised, despite their attempt\n          to hide it. Judit appears more annoyed than surprised. After a very\n          brief silence:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           GIRL\n           (To Harry) I must go.\n\n           HARRY\n           Thanks for helping me cross.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit (forty-eight years old, seems younger, is dressed in an informal\n          and sober manner, little color, etc., her hair is pulled back, parted\n          in the middle, her attitude is that of a guardian), she puts away the\n          key to the door while she gazes sternly at the young woman.\n          The Girl, very uncomfortable, quickly vanishes.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12.

If anything, he touches any given\n          piece of furniture with the tip of his fingers, as if to ascertain\n          whether it's still there. He walks both with ease, and with the\n          characteristic rigidity of blind people.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           15\n\n          \n          He picks up the socks from the floor and slips them on (the newspaper\n          is open on the floor). He puts his shoes on. Judit watches him for a\n          moment, and then turns toward the window.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13. JUDIT'S POINT OF VIEW.

From the window she can make out that it's an\n          important Modeling Agency.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          RETURN TO SEQ. 12\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit is still looking out the window, her back to Harry, when she\n          hears him say:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Ernesto Martel has died.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit turns to Harry, surprised but masking it with her voice.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           I think he was very ill...\n\n           HARRY\n           It's been so long since we've spoken of him!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit nods plainly with her head.

HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. CONTINUED.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The doorbell rings. It's Diego, Judit's son, who doubles as Harry's\n          typist and co-scriptwriter. He is a special kid, twenty-five years\n          old. Baggy-eyed, a weary aspect, but he overflows with charm.\n          Dresses as a modern kid, but not obnoxiously so. He speaks\n          delicately, an attitude uncommon for someone his age.\n          He greets his mother.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           You look awful ...!\n\n           DIEGO\n           I ran here.\n\n           HARRY\n           And it's Monday! Diego, you don't have to run for me.\n           We are not in a hurry.\n\n           JUDIT\n           I am, I've committed ...\n\n           HARRY\n           You'll have it by tonight, don't worry.\n\n           JUDIT\n           Start thinking of the next script. Some kind of\n           horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It's\n           what sells best ...\n\n           HARRY\n           I don't know if I'll know how to. I was thinking of\n           developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller's son...\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Perplexed) The writer who married Marilyn?\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           17\n\n          \n           Yes... After Marilyn he married the photographer Inge\n           Morat and they had a son. He was born mentally\n           handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even\n           mention him in his memoirs. He never recognized him\n           publicly. From the moment he was born, he had him\n           placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of\n           him. Despite his condition, the boy was able to learn\n           and to make an almost normal life for himself. He\n           lived in an apartment with other friends and he found\n           a job as a clerk in a supermarket...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit looks at him perplexed. For some reason, Harry has his back\n          turned. This happens many times.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           And Miller never saw him? ...\n\n           HARRY\n           (Continues, his back turned) One day, Miller was\n           giving a conference in defense of a mentally retarded\n           man, who had been condemned to death, after what was\n           believed to be a forced confession. Among those\n           present was his mentally handicapped son, who was\n           integrally involved with organizations that aided all\n           sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to\n           finally be sharing something with his father. At the\n           end of the conference, he approached the stage and\n           held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless\n           to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract\n           himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine,\n           it would not have been politically correct, least of\n           all given the situation in which Miller found himself.\n           Then the stranger let go of him and told him: \"I am\n\n           18\n\n          \n           your son, Daniel, and I am very proud of you, Father!\"\n           This was the only time father and son saw each other.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judith listens, affected and disoriented. She looks at her son as if\n          she were looking for help. Diego stops thumbing through a magazine in\n          order to listen to Harry and to witness his mother's reaction. She\n          wasn't ready for Harry to counter with such a shocking narrative.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           (Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but I don't think\n           we can write a script about Arthur Miller without\n           procuring rights from the family.\n\n           HARRY\n           We change the names, the story is not about the\n           writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the\n           son who survives without the least bit of rancor\n           toward the father who has ignored him his entire life.\n           It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent\n           goodness. There aren't those many good men that one\n           can write about.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit would like to say that when she spoke of a commercial script\n          this is not what she had in mind, but she doesn't want to come off\n          rude. Diego keeps watching them. Her mother appears oddly cornered,\n          until she remembers a past comment of Harry's, that suits her just\n\n          RIGHT:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           It's a beautiful story. But years ago, when you began\n           writing again and I began selling your scripts, you\n           told me you'd never write remakes, sequels, nor\n           biopics. Nor stories whose protagonists were film\n\n           19\n\n          \n           directors, handicapped or blind. I remember clearly\n           because the part of the biopics surprised me.\n\n           (SMILES)\n\n           HARRY\n           I can't bear them... (As if he had at that very moment\n           remembered) It's true, it's true I said all that, but\n           this wouldn't exactly be a biopic...\n\n          \n\n          \n          They hear the doorbell ring, two or three times. For Judit, it's the\n          best way to escape the conversation.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           I'll get it.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego settles on the armchair, in front of his laptop. On the other\n          side of the table sits the computer that is specially programmed for\n          Harry. Diego powers his laptop. Harry heads for the work table. And\n          he sits in front of Diego.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Diego, go to the end of the document.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego obeys while we hear Judit approaching the door and, before she\n          opens it, someone opens it from the other side. We see the document's\n          text (a script) scrolling, fleetingly, over Diego's computer screen.\n\n          \n\n          \n          At the door, Judit finds Mariacruz, the Latin American maid, who also\n          has her own key to the house. She is carrying two shopping bags.\n          Judit gives her some directive (about the windows, the curtains, the\n          kitchen furniture, the food, the floors, things to be dry cleaned ,\n          etc.) and she leaves, saying goodbye to Harry and Diego with a simple\n          \"Boys, I'm leaving. Goodbye!\"\n\n           20\n\n          \n\n          15. NIGHT. BAR WITH MUSIC. INT. BOOTH.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego chooses a track that functions as background music to the three\n          night sequences that follow, although it's not absolutely necessary.\n          He works at a modern bar (not very large), as a D.J. He spends most\n          of the time inside a small booth, which only a few friends access.\n          Alex, his same age, enters.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Did you bring me the session?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Alex takes three CDs out of his jacket.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ALEX\n           It's still warm.

HARRY-MATEO HOME. DEN. NIGHT\n\n          \n\n          \n          At that moment, Harry is in front the computer (a special computer,\n          sonorous, set up for Harry, with Braille signs jutting from the\n          keyboard). He attempts to \"read\" some digital newspaper, its contents\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           21\n\n          \n          can be heard spoken by a very unpleasant synthetic voice. His search\n          produces annoying and strange sounds. Harry continously makes\n          mistakes, but that's the way to do it.\n          He manages to get into El Pais, the obituary section. He listens to a\n          list. He finally finds the news of Ernesto Martel's death. He listens\n          to the headline.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The sound of a mobile phone ringing interrupts him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17. JUDIT'S OFFICE. INT. NIGHT.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          It's Judit, from her office.\n          In front of Judit, on the other side of the table, full of papers, is\n          the head of production and someone from the American production. They\n          are trying to decide on the budget.\n          From the ashtrays full of cigarettes, the bottles of water and the\n          cups of coffee, one assumes that they must have been at this task for\n          many hours. (One should be able to see the layout of the shooting\n          schedule, something visual). The American production can be heard in\n          the background.\n          (Seq. 16 and 17 run in parallel)\n          She greets Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           You need anything?\n\n           MATEO\n           No, thanks.\n\n           JUDIT\n           What are you up to?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           22\n\n          \n          Harry touches the small MP3, much easier than to listen to the digital\n          newspaper. He doesn't want to tell her that he is attempting to\n          listen to Ernesto Martel's obituary, so he tells her what he will be\n          doing next.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I was going to read an Alice Munro story on the MP3.\n\n           JUDIT\n           Then I'll leave you.

Through the windows one can\n          witness a cosmopolitan Madrid, from whose soil skyscrapers begin to\n          bud.\n          Ernesto Martel, almost sixty, impeccable suit, settles a conversation\n          with the Transportation Minister.\n          Framed photographs sit on a piece of accessory furniture, one of him\n          with his two children, a boy and a girl, who do not resemble one\n          another.

Fairly close to the boss' office, divided by\n          modern and ample cubicles, we find some of the company's employees.\n          His secretary, Magdalena (her diminutive is Lena), is speaking on the\n          phone with a look of contained alarm. Personal problems.\n          In her early thirties, Lena is dressed soberly, almost excessively so\n          (as if she were attempting to project a maturity, effectiveness and\n          responsibility that she not yet possesses). She is a very beautiful\n          woman, on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its\n          mark. She has a small mole, slightly raised, next to the seam of the\n          lips, and another one on the top edge of the nose. She could do more\n          with her physique, modernize it, but this is not what she aims for.\n          Her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the American film noir,\n          brought up to date. She possesses the turbulent and at once\n          translucent beauty of Gene Tierney and the bored disdain of Linda\n          Darnell (in \"Fallen Angels\"). Lena is a splendid fallen angel.\n          We can't hear what she says, but judging from her reaction, the\n          content of her conversation is dramatic. Her eyes flash with\n          indignation and anger.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          RETURN TO 19.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           25\n\n          \n          Ernesto Martel calls Lena, his personal secretary, by way of an\n          internal line.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          RETURN TO 20.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Magdalena interrupts her conversation with \"I'll call you later\", as\n          the indicator lights up, announcing another call on the line. She\n          pushes on the button corresponding to that phone call and she hears\n          her boss' voice summoning her. \"Yes, sir\", she responds, promptly.\n          She gets up from the table. She dries her eyes and nose with a\n          Kleenex, grabs a pen and a rectangular writing block and heads to\n          Ernesto Martel's office.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          21.

DAY. 1990\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Despite the fact that he's dealing in grand-scale business, there are\n          few documents for him to consult on his desk. It gives the sense that\n          for the most important part of his job (grand scale speculation),\n          Ernesto deals directly. He is the great intermediary without\n          intermediaries.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Magdalena enters. He invites her to take a seat. She complies\n          without altogether controlling her nervousness; professionally\n          detached, she attempts to hide the tension that the recent, and\n          truncated, telephone conversation has caused her.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO\n           I will dictate a letter for the Minister of Industry...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           26\n\n          \n          Magdalena opens her writing pad, ready to write, looking serious. Her\n          pen drops to the floor. Ernesto M. observes her.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO\n           Are you alright?\n\n           MAGDALENA\n           (As she picks it up) Yes, thank you.\n\n          \n\n          \n          But it's not true.

I'm sure I could\n           help you.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena looks at him, serious and hurt:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MAGDALENA\n           My father is very ill. This afternoon they are\n           releasing him and I wanted to ask you if I could leave\n           an hour early to go pick him and my mother up.\n\n           ERNESTO\n           Of course.

Lena arrives\n          inside a taxi to the entrance of Puerta de Hierro Hospital. On the\n          sidewalk, next to the entryway, her mother awaits, (chubby, tired,\n          defenseless and impatient, she's around sixty) next to her, a suitcase\n          and a huge plastic bag full of clothes. The mother is a small-town\n          woman, dignified and beaten. The shock provoked by the situation has\n          liberated her, if only momentarily, from falling into desperation.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Through the car's window, Lena can see her mother on the sidewalk, and\n          her ailing Father (a man in his sixties, very debilitated and aged),\n          sitting on a sofa in the foyer.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena tells the cab-driver to wait, and runs toward her mother. They\n          kiss.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           I can't believe they have thrown you out of the\n           hospital, like dogs...\n\n           MOTHER\n           (Humiliated, hurt) Yes, honey, yes...\n\n           LENA\n           (Indignant) Does Dr. Alvaro de la Torre know this?\n\n          \n\n          \n          The mother gestures for them to get away from the door, that way the\n          Father cannot see them.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MOTHER\n           He's been the one...\n\n           LENA\n           But how?

(She recounts) Dr.\n           De la Torre called us for an appointment. I though it\n           would be to tells us that they were finally going to\n           operate on your father... but instead he tells us they\n           are releasing him. (In disbelief) I asked him what\n           he meant and he replied: \"quite simple, it's July and\n           I am leaving for my vacation\" (as her story moves\n           forward the mother relives the same states of mind\n           that she went through in her conversation with the\n           doctor) And I told him, \"you are throwing us out onto\n           the street?\" and he insisted, without the least bit\n           of compassion, \"I am releasing him so that you can go\n           home\", but \"what can I do with him at home in his\n           condition?\". \"That's your problem\" he told me (she\n           cries), \"do whatever you like, I am leaving on\n           vacation\". \"He is dying!\" I begged. \"Well, let him\n           die in peace, at home\", he said to me.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           (Powerless, furious) It cannot be! They can't keep\n           him for twenty days, torturing him with tests in\n           preparation for an operation and now leave him like\n           this, just because the doctor is leaving on vacation!\n\n          \n\n          \n          The Mother looks at her without knowing what to say.

He leans down to catch his breath. With a weak voice,\n          almost inaudible, he says to them:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           FATHER\n           Did you forget about me?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena and the mother approach him, almost jubilant, hiding their sense\n          of helplessness and frustration.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           (Her eyes welled up with tears, she gathers her last\n           bit of strength) How could you think that Dad!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Between the two women they help the father to the taxi that is waiting\n          for them nearby. They put him in the car. The man can hardly walk.\n          He is very thin, his bones jut out from under his ashen skin. He\n          walks crouched over.\n          The taxi pulls off.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          23. PERIPHERAL HIGHWAY, MADRID. INSIDE THE TAXI. HIGHWAY.

PERIPHERAL NEIGHBORHOOD. EXT. DAY. 1990.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The taxi parks in front of a humble building, in one of those outlying\n          neighborhoods in the periphery of Madrid, a commuter town. Children,\n          women, street ambience. It's like a provincial town, transported to a\n          huge city that is in the midst of merciless development. At that hour\n          there are few people on the street.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The passage between this sequence and the next happens through the\n          doors of the car and the apartment, respectively.\n          The Father exits, aided by Lena and the Mother, when the door to the\n          taxi closes it's the door to the apartment that shuts, with all three\n          characters inside the entry hall.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           31\n\n          \n\n          25. LENA'S PARENTS' HOME. INT. DAY. 1990.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena locks the door from inside. It's a humble and small apartment,\n          Magdalena and her mother situate the man on the bed in the master\n          bedroom, in the most comfortable way possible.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The d\u00e9cor reflects the bad taste of the era, especially of that social\n          class, here and there a certain rural detail stands out. Antique\n          photographs of the grandparents. Photographs of the Father in his\n          policeman uniform, next to the Mother.\n          Over the headboard, there is a crucifix on the wall and perhaps a\n          thick, wooden rosary. Religious images on the nighstands. Attention\n          placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the\n          walls. Everything is new, ugly period furniture.

He is not waiting for anyone, so he hopes the visitor will\n          think he is watching, even if he can't see a thing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           (From inside) Who is it?\n\n          \n\n          \n          A voice on the other side of the door responds:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY X\n           I'm Ray X ...\n\n           HARRY\n           Ray X? There's no such a name.\n\n           RAY X\n           It's a nickname, at one time I took a lot of ecstasy.\n\n           HARRY\n           What do you want?\n\n           RAY X\n           To write a script with you, so that I can direct it.\n\n           HARRY\n           It's your first film?\n\n           RAY X\n           I made a documentary (na\u00efve) ... a very good one,\n           eighteen years ago, this would be my first fiction\n           film.\n\n           HARRY\n\n           43\n\n          \n           OK. Call Judit Garcia, my agent, and explain\n           everything. If she finds it suitable, she will set up\n           a date for us. And now, I'd like to go dry myself, you\n           pulled me out of the shower and I am dripping wet.\n\n           RAY X\n           (The words escape) You are naked?\n\n           HARRY\n           It's none of your business.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ray does not move. Neither does Harry. They both remain still and\n          mute on their respective sides of the door, waiting for the other to\n          do something. Ray is mortified about having asked the last question.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Will you stand there all day?\n\n           RAY X\n           You haven't given me Judit Garcia's phone number.\n\n           HARRY\n           Find it out. She is a well-known Production Director.\n\n          \n\n          \n          This time Ray steps away from the door and walks toward the elevator.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          38.

(He is about to tell her he showed up without\n           notice, but Judit doesn't give him time to).\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Since she is always busy and in a hurry) Well, he\n           wants to see you this afternoon, or tomorrow, if you\n           can.

HARRY-MATEO HOME. DEN. INT. DAY. 2008\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          (The next morning, Harry wears different clothes than in the previous\n          sequence and Ray X as well.)\n\n          \n\n          \n          The doorbell rings. It's Ray X. Mariacruz opens the door. Harry\n          waits for him while seated at his desk, one can hear the noises his\n          computer generates.\n          Ray X heads toward the den and introduces himself.\n          Harry stretches his hand and waits for the other man to find it and\n          shake it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY X\n           Hi, I'm Ray X.\n\n          \n\n          \n          They shake hands.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Hello Mr. X. Please, have a seat...\n\n           RAY X\n           Please, don't address me formally.\n\n          \n\n          \n          (Perhaps the kitchen is lit and only the light from the window enters\n          the area where the conversation is taking place).\n          Ray watches Harry inquisitively. He observes everything, the\n          furniture, the wall-hangings and Harry's own body, shamelessly, taking\n          advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him.\n          Mateo senses the heat of his visitor's gaze over his body.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           46\n\n          \n          Ray is thirty-five years old and his physique is somewhere between\n          freakish and bohemian but expensively dressed, hard to classify, thin,\n          with a beard. Only when he speaks he reveals his well-bred origin\n          (not excessively, nor parodically, just sufficiently evocative). He\n          is excited by the very fact of being there, it seems it is something\n          he has been desiring for some time.\n          He takes advantage of the fact that Harry cannot see him in order to\n          observe him without reserve.\n          During the conversation, Harry is not always sitting. At some point\n          he moves (to look for cigarettes, perhaps) and remains standing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY\n           I love your work, I know it from the start.\n\n           HARRY\n           Thank you.\n\n           RAY\n           I have seen all of Mateo Blanco's films, including the\n           last one, \"Girls and Suitcases\".\n\n           HARRY\n           Is that so? You must be the only one.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          40. HARRY'S HOME. VESTIBULE AND KITCHEN. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          At this exact moment, Diego enters. Mariacruz opens the door for him.\n          Just in time to hear Ray's question.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY\n           What happened to Mateo Blanco?\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           47\n\n          \n           Why do you ask?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          40 A.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego goes to the kitchen. Harry has heard him, he knows he's there,\n          if he hasn't called him it's because he doesn't need him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY\n           Because he vanished from public life...\n\n           HARRY\n           It would seem that way.\n\n           RAY\n           Almost as if he'd died.\n\n           HARRY\n           Yes . . . (Ironically) I lost track of him some time ago.\n\n           RAY\n           I've always been intrigued by the case of his last film.\n\n           HARRY\n           Whose?\n\n           RAY\n           Mateo Blanco's. The first five are stupendous. You\n           were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you\n           explain that the last one was a disaster?\n\n           HARRY\n           (Made uncomfortable by the topic) Films turn out well\n           or badly. The reason is always a mystery. (Mateo\n           switched genres, perhaps he wasn't skilled for\n           comedy). But tell me about the story you want to\n           write.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           48\n\n          \n          Ray X measures his words, it's very important to him and he doesn't\n          want to do so hastily.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY\n           ... I would like to write a story about a son's revenge,\n           one against the memory of his father.\n\n           HARRY\n           Why does the son desire revenge?\n\n           RAY\n           (Speaking personally) Because the father ruined his\n           life, practically nullifying him while he lived. The\n           father is a successful financier, violent, homophobic,\n           very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone\n           has a price and that's how he behaves with people. I\n           don't know if you've had the misfortune of meeting\n           someone like this...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry does not allay his doubt.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           When you say he is powerful, what kind of power are\n           you referring to?\n\n           RAY X\n           Economic, with everything that entails. He is a\n           broker, of the generation of speculators that made\n           quick, high-profit gains in the 80s; he amassed a\n           great fortune during the oil crisis. The son is\n           sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations,\n           and lives under his shadow, trying to please the\n           father in everything. Despite being a bit...\n           homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the\n           father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a\n\n           49\n\n          \n           son that hates him just as much as he hates his own\n           father. When the father dies, the son is finally able\n           to rebuild his life. That is his salvation and his\n           revenge.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you are\n           looking for.\n\n           RAY X\n           You are, you don't know how much!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry registers what he has just heard.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY X\n           I will pay whatever you ask.\n\n           HARRY\n           It's too personal.\n\n           RAY X\n           Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic, rather,\n           I think of it as a base from which to develop a\n           fiction.\n\n           HARRY\n           Thanks, but no. (He rises) And now, if you don't mind...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          41. CONTINUED.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He calls Diego. The boy responds in that instant, he was in the\n          kitchen, waiting for Harry to call him.\n          Ray X will not give up, so he writes his telephone number on a piece\n          of paper and places it in his hand.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           50\n\n          \n\n           RAY X\n           There you have my phone number, if you change your mind.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry is still standing, with the piece of paper in his hand. Diego\n          observes both men.\n          Ray gets up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           RAY X\n           I am sure we will see each other again.\n\n           HARRY\n           In my case, that would be a miracle.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego accompanies him to the door. And closes it behind him.\n          Harry opens his desk's drawer and places the piece of paper with Ray's\n          telephone number inside. He rummages through the drawer's interior\n          until he finds a key. He grabs it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          42. CONTINUED.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry and Diego are now alone, in the den. Ruminating over Ray X's\n          visit and the story he was proposing Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Did you overhear that?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Yes... I'm flipping out! Why did he ask you if Mateo\n           had died?\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           51\n\n          \n           To provoke me... I don't know... Help me find\n           something... (he points toward the drawers at the\n           bottom of the bookcase and he hands him the key to\n           open one of them) Look inside that drawer.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego opens the drawer with the key Harry has given him. The drawer\n          is full of different groups of photographs and various objects mixed\n          in a certain order. There is a black notebook. A box with Mexican\n          handicrafts. Some 1980s postcards as well some from other decades,\n          some movie postcards, some others of exotic landscapes... Some of the\n          groups of photographs are sorted into envelopes, boxes or transparent\n          binders. For Diego it's like looking into a treasure chest. It has\n          been many years since that drawer has been opened. This was out of\n          respect, not from lack of curiosity, Diego would never do so behind\n          Harry's back.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot. Some of\n           the photographs must have the date on it.\n\n          \n\n          \n          After tossing aside various envelopes, Diego finds a lot of\n          photographs of the shooting, dated `94. He takes them out of their\n          envelope.\n          He shuffles through them, until he pauses at one.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           I think this is him...\n\n           HARRY\n           Who?\n\n           DIEGO\n           The man who just left.\n\n           HARRY\n\n           52\n\n          \n           (Rising) Describe the picture to me.\n\n           DIEGO\n           It's from the shoot. (He looks at the box from where\n           he's taken it). He is carrying a small camera, like a\n           Super 8.\n\n           HARRY\n           It's a 16mm. Are you sure it's him?\n\n           DIEGO\n           He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it's him. He\n           is talking to you.\n\n           HARRY\n           What am I saying?\n\n           DIEGO\n           I don't know. He is handing you something, it looks\n           like a pack of cigarettes.\n\n           HARRY\n           It's a radio microphone. He is asking me to wear it\n           and I am refusing it.\n\n           DIEGO\n           Who is he?\n\n           HARRY\n           Ernesto Martel's son.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry is perturbed by the confirmation of his doubts. He would have\n          preferred to be mistaken.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           (Serious and pensive) You can put them away now...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego returns the different sets of photographs to their place, inside\n          the drawer a photo appears of Lena's face, in close-up. It's the same\n          woman who appears in sequences 20 through 36.\n\n           53\n\n          \n          The drawer closes, darkness engulfs its interior, drowning Lena's\n          image, soon reborn in the next sequence.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          43. HOME, ERNESTO MARTEL SENIOR. (1992)\n\n          \n\n          \n          Out of the darkness, Lena's image emerges, the year is `92: A close-\n          up of the woman, looking at herself in the mirror, touching up her\n          makeup. She grabs a dress by a famous designer of the time and puts\n          it on.\n\n          \n\n          \n          A few meters away, in the bedroom, Ernesto buttons up his fly, after\n          tucking in his shirt tail. The scene is that of a wealthy couple, who\n          get along.\n          They are preparing to attend a concert. Ernesto is a big fan of\n          classical music.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena looks rejuvenated and more refined. Her life and her facial skin\n          have both improved since the first time we see her in Martel's office.\n          The moles have disappeared from her face. Her demeanor is still adult,\n          that of a young woman who has experienced life.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto Martel frequently rests his gaze on her, fascinated, it's hard\n          for him to believe that \"such beauty\" belongs to him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          44.

He is already seventeen.\n\n           OFF\n           The doctor has told me he is in need of a father\n           figure... I think I am going to send him your way so\n           that he can spend some time with you, after all you\n           are his father.\n\n           ERNESTO\n           If I haven't been a good father in eighteen years, I\n           don't think I can learn to be one precisely now.\n\n           OFF\n           How can you speak like that! Have you no feelings?\n\n           ERNESTO\n           (Looks at Lena, intently) I have them. Very deep\n           feelings, they just don't include either of you.\n\n          \n\n          \n          While he speaks, Lena consults him about the jewelry she is about to\n          put on, she tries on different pairs of earrings for his approval,\n          something he gives without pausing his phone conversation.\n\n           55\n\n          \n          Lena makes a gesture of reproach. Ernesto should not speak to his ex-\n          wife in that tone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           OFF\n           If anything happens to him, you'll know who's at fault.\n\n           ERNESTO\n           Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna. Tell Ernesto that if\n           he wants to talk to me he should call me himself.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto Martel Senior hangs up, bewildered.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          45.

They are\n          having fun, as if playing a game. The sequence becomes a\n          demonstration of the process of creating fiction, based on an trivial,\n          real anecdote. (They will begin the sequence by opening a document.\n          Diego writes the title in caps: DONATE BLOOD.)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           The vampires would be like a type of ethnic group,\n           completely assimilated into Spanish society, they\n           don't stand out. There are vampires who occupy\n           important positions, keeping it a secret (like the\n           Opus Dei). But even though they live in the shadows,\n           they have amassed great social and economic power...\n\n           HARRY\n           They control various industries. For example, the one\n           responsible for dark sunglasses...\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Smiles) And those that provide nightly entertainment:\n           bars, discos, after-hours... Since they don't need drugs\n           to stay awake, they are the most apt for working at\n           night. They don't burn out...\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           65\n\n          \n           And for the sunscreen business. The poor things are\n           very sensitive to climate change and to the holes in\n           the ozone layer. Their sunscreens are some of the\n           best on the market.\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Laughs) And those which sell best... This is all great...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego talks and takes notes on his laptop. Harry paces back and\n          forth, in front of the table, like a caged animal.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Protected by the sunscreen, they can function all day...\n           The lotion must be as dense as armour.\n\n           DIEGO\n           (More inspired) This is how the story could begin:\n           (describes) A gorgeous woman, totally naked, rubbing\n           her body with a super-dense lotion, before heading to\n           work at an ambulatory hospital. Her body is a velvety\n           pale, beautiful...\n\n           HARRY\n           (Continues) What a great opening! We also need a love\n           story...\n\n           DIEGO\n           A hybrid love story, between the female vampire and a\n           normal guy.\n\n           HARRY\n           Like in \"Cat People\", a love story between beings of\n           different species...\n\n           DIEGO\n           She works at one of those labs where blood is donated\n           and where they snatch it for themselves. The guy has\n           gone to donate his, or to get some tests. They like\n\n           66\n\n          \n          each other immediately. After the first needle prick\n          into his vein, she gets completely excited. So, they\n          start to date. But she doesn't want to turn him into\n          a vampire... these aren't proselytizing vampires, they\n          are above biting people... unless they truly need it to\n          survive...\n\n           HARRY\n          But they must like sex, right?\n\n           DIEGO\n          Of course. That's one of the problems, the couple\n          desire each other desperately. But when it comes to\n          fucking, she becomes prudish...\n\n           HARRY\n          Why?\n\n           DIEGO\n          Because she is afraid of losing control in her\n          excitement and taking a bite into his jugular...\n\n           HARRY\n          Aha.\n\n           DIEGO\n          When they're horny, she lets him do everything, front,\n          back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her mouth.\n\n           HARRY\n          And her breasts?\n\n           DIEGO\n          Also... But that gets into high-risk territory. When\n          he sucks on her breasts, she has to cover her mouth\n          with a pillow, which she ends up shredding with her\n          fangs...\n\n           HARRY\n          And when she sucks his dick?\n\n           DIEGO\n\n           67\n\n          \n           No, no sucking. She would tear it on the first bite.\n\n           HARRY\n           And how does he react? A man may do without kissing,\n           but it's very rough not to have your cock sucked.\n\n           DIEGO\n           Since he is deeply in love, he accepts the situation\n           (or gives up to it). Once they are more comfortable\n           with each other, she wears a muzzle, as security for\n           both. Because when she's turned on, she has a type of\n           dental erection, her face grows into something like\n           that of a she-wolf...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego writes furiously, while cracking up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I like your story very much, Diego.\n\n           DIEGO\n           Our story.\n\n           HARRY\n           No. This one was your idea, and you'll author it.\n           I'll be your sparring partner, for all the times\n           you've done the same for me...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry is welcoming him as a writer. This fact doesn't escape the boy,\n          he feels an unexpected pride.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          52. MODERN AND MODEST BAR WHERE DIEGO WORKS. NIGHT. INT. 2008\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          At nights, Diego D.J.'s inside a small booth. Two of his friends, or\n          just acquaintances of the club scene, one of them we've already seen\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           68\n\n          \n          earlier, keep him company. The one we don't know, Friend A, looks\n          pretty loaded. He is very \"friendly\" with the other two.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           (Without acrimony) Stop fondling me... damn it!\n\n           ALEX\n           It's the GHB. It kicks your ass.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego takes a sip of Coke and whisky and sets it down somewhere inside\n          the booth.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ALEX\n           Do you want a little bit of \"X\"? (referring to\n           \"MDMA\", aka Ecstasy)\n\n           DIEGO\n           Just a tip. (He licks his finger and sticks its moist\n           tip into the bag that Alex offers him, he takes his\n           finger to his mouth) Tomorrow I have to work, we are\n           writing a vampire script that's going to be the shit!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          AT THE BAR .\n\n          \n\n          \n          The Friend, high on GHB, grabs a glass of Coca-cola from the\n          bartender's hands, at the bar. He takes out a small container and\n          adds a few drops of liquid ecstasy into the drink.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He takes a sip and enters the booth where the other two are. He sets\n          the glass down and begins to jump, euphorically.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Stop already, you are going to go through the roof.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           69\n\n          \n          In between songs, (he is changing the tune) Diego grabs Friend A's\n          drink. They are both drinking Coca-Cola, Diego's has whisky and Friend\n          A's has liquid ecstasy. Distracted by changing tunes, Diego does not\n          realize that he has grabbed the drink with GHB. He takes a long sip.\n          And he falls flat to the floor.\n          The two friends, bewildered and scared, attempt to revive him, but to\n          no avail. Perhaps Alex will exclaim:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ALEX\n           Holy shit, he's taken a drink from your glass! Why in\n           the world did you get Coca-cola! Didn't you notice he\n           was drinking a jack and coke?\n\n           FRIEND A\n           I didn't realize!\n\n           ALEX\n           (Very alarmed) He's unconscious!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          53. BAR EXTERIOR. NIGHT. 2008 (OPTIONAL)\n\n          \n\n          \n          An ambulance arrives.\n          They carry Diego out, unconscious, from the bar on a stretcher. Alex\n          goes with him, very scared. Before they go into the vehicle, Diego's\n          mobile phone rings. Alex takes it from Diego's pocket, he doesn't\n          know why he is doing so, it is a hysterical reaction. On the other\n          side of the line, he hears Harry's voice.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ALEX\n           No. I'm a friend. Diego just... he's not well. We\n           are taking him into the emergency room...\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           70\n\n          \n           Emergency? Can I talk to him?\n\n           ALEX\n           No... because...\n\n           HARRY\n           What hospital are you taking him to?\n\n          \n\n          \n          The friend asks one of the ambulance employees who tells him the\n          name of the hospital. Alex repeats it for Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ALEX\n           Who are you?\n\n           HARRY\n           (Improvising) ...His uncle.

NIGHT. 2008\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry gets out of a taxi. He aids himself with the typical blind\n          man's cane. He can't find the entryway. He bumps into something. We\n          have not yet seen him this clumsy. Someone helps him enter. The same\n          person accompanies him to the reception desk in the waiting-room area.\n          He is no longer the blind man who was walking euphorically along his\n          street's sidewalk, umbrella in hand.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           (Anxious) I am here to see Diego Garcia. He's just been\n           admitted.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The \"receptionist\" looks through the admittances. Taking into account\n          that Harry is blind, she decides to call the Doctor who has attended\n          Diego.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           71\n\n          \n\n          54 A.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Shortly thereafter, the Doctor appears. He heads directly for Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           I am here to see Diego Garcia.\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Are you immediate family?\n\n           HARRY\n           (Improvises) Yes... I'm his uncle, and his godfather.\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Your nephew is at the ICU, he arrived in a coma...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry reacts to the news.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           In a coma?\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Yes...\n\n           HARRY\n           But, what has happened?!\n\n           DOCTOR\n           He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol... it is a lethal\n           combination. His friend informed us it was a mistake...\n           (It happens sometimes, kids grab the wrong glass...)\n\n           HARRY\n           My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy...\n\n          \n\n          \n          The doctor makes a neutral gesture of acknowledgement...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           72\n\n          \n\n           DOCTOR\n           Barring any complications, he will recover in six to\n           twelve hours.\n\n           HARRY\n           If that's the case, I'll wait...\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Go home, we will call you...\n\n           HARRY\n           I'd rather wait.\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Are you certain?\n\n           HARRY\n           Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit, please...\n\n          \n\n          \n          The Doctor directs him toward an area with sofas.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DOCTOR\n           Would you mind providing us with his parents' phone\n           number?\n\n           HARRY\n           He only has a mother and, at the moment, she is\n           working outside Madrid... I would prefer to call her\n           myself... I don't want to alarm her, unless he is truly\n           in a grave condition...\n\n           DOCTOR\n           Normally, he should recuperate in a few hours... but,\n           in any case, you should have a talk with him, once\n           he's better...\n\n           HARRY\n           Yes, of course...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           73\n\n          \n          They arrive at a couch set, ugly and lacking style, Harry collapses on\n          one of the armchairs, demolished.\n          The Doctor returns to work.\n          The girl at the reception desk stares at Harry, who is immobile,\n          readied for a long wait.\n          A slow fade to black.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          55. HARRY'S HOME. HARRY'S BEDROOM. INT. DAWN. 2008\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          From black.\n          Harry is still waiting, this time at home, sitting on a wingback chair\n          close to the bed where Diego sleeps.\n          On the nightstand, there are some medications and a glass of water,\n          next to a plastic bottle, an alarm-clock. And perhaps a book.\n          Through the window you can see the day beginning to break, Diego\n          awakens. At first he doesn't know where he is. In the darkness of\n          the room he discovers Harry's figure, sitting on the wingback chair.\n          He can't tell if he's awake or asleep, but it soothes him to know he's\n          not alone. Diego stares at him, he doesn't say anything. Just\n          stares.\n          To his surprise, Harry asks him:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           How are you?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego makes a listless gesture.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           I don't know... dazed. Did you speak with my mother?\n\n           HARRY\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           74\n\n          \n           Yes, I told her it was something you ate...\n\n           DIEGO\n           And she believed it?\n\n           HARRY\n           I don't know. She wanted to hurry back, but I\n           convinced her to continue with the location scouting.\n           At some point you'll have to call her.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Silence. Diego thinks about everything's that's happened.\n          After a few seconds:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Are you asleep?\n\n           DIEGO\n           I'm not sleepy anymore.\n\n           HARRY\n           Do you want to talk?\n\n           DIEGO\n           No...\n\n           HARRY\n           Would you like me to speak?\n\n           DIEGO\n           I don't know. If you'd like...\n\n           HARRY\n           I say so in order to distract you. When I was young,\n           before I got into making movies, I was very good at\n           telling stories.\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Not sure) Well, then... would you mind telling me why\n           my mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?\n\n           HARRY\n           She's afraid of him?\n\n           75\n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Before she left, she made me promise that I would\n           remain alert, in case he reappeared...\n\n           HARRY\n           She didn't explain why?\n\n           DIEGO\n           She never explains anything.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry remains pensive for a moment, Diego's request has taken him by\n          surprise.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           It's a long story...\n\n           DIEGO\n           Judit says the same thing. How did you meet him?\n\n          \n\n          \n          It is not easy to talk about. In some way it must be obvious that\n          Harry has spent many years (fourteen) avoiding this topic, but he is\n          determined to do anything necessary to entertain Diego.\n          Diego serves himself some water and prepares to listen.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           We met him... In an office we had rented in preparation\n           for my new film, about fourteen years ago.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          56. MATEO'S OFFICE. INT. DAY. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The images that correspond to the past are edited more freely than the\n          rest of the narrative. Summarized and sped-up by Harry's voice-off,\n          mixing media from diverse sources.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           76\n\n          \n\n           OFF HARRY\n           ...After having written five dramas, I had finally\n           managed to write a script for a comedy, or that's what\n           I thought. I wanted to change genres... to take a risk\n           (ironic-destructive) And I swear I accomplished that,\n           the part about taking a risk.\n\n          \n\n          \n          In 1994, everyone calls Harry \"Mateo\". He is sitting behind a table\n          filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil\n          and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of\n          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the\n          definitive version of \"Girls and Suitcases\".\n\n          \n\n          \n          The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The\n          only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any\n          particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or\n          landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page\n          that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph,\n          taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without\n          framing, tacked directly onto the wall.\n          The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet\n          tapestry, worn and outmoded. The pieces don't match, but they look\n          good together.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit enters (also fourteen years younger, but this is less obvious.\n          She is a woman unmarked by the march of time.)\n          Mateo is focused on the script's pages. Judit is Mateo's right-hand\n          man, they are accomplices in everything, both professionally and\n          emotionally.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n\n           77\n\n          \n           A girl has stopped by.

If she's been with him for three years,\n           she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be\n           polite.

WAITING AREA. 1994.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo exits his office. In the improvised waiting area (it is not a\n          proper waiting room but a transient-space turned waiting area by a\n          couch left over from the furnishings of some previous film). He finds\n          Ernesto Junior (in other words, the character who had introduced\n          himself as Ray X fourteen years ago; in his case, the age-difference\n          is noticeable, he's just a kid). He is a little heavier, his hair\n          longer, he reminds us of the love-struck big-kid that Phyllip Seymour\n          Hoffman played in \"Boogie Nights\".\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           78\n\n          \n          Mateo's gaze rests only for an instant on the young man, even though\n          the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from Mateo throughout\n          the entire sequence.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto Junior has accompanied Lena. When he sees her, Mateo freezes,\n          at the door to his office.\n          Lena's back is turned, or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine.\n          Ernesto elbows her, Lena raises her head and discovers Mateo, watching\n          her from the door to his office.\n          Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like\n          James Stewart in \"Vertigo\", when he first sees Kim Novak at the\n          restaurant, with her famous green dress. Time stops for an instant so\n          that Mateo may contemplate this woman's apparition.\n\n          \n\n          \n          After this brief hypnotic moment, they introduce themselves,\n          forgetting Ernesto's presence, who then, since no one pays attention\n          to him, introduces himself.\n          Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong\n          and decisive woman. Brunette. Mysterious. Made-up in dark tones that\n          stand out on her pale skin. Refined. She doesn't have the aspect of a\n          comedienne, her presence is too intense, she seems better suited to be\n          the heroine of a film noir (as we've said).\n          Genres and their iconographies pose no limit on Mateo's capacity to be\n          attracted to her, from the first instant.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           I am sorry we showed up like this, but I've heard you\n           are running auditions... and I would like for you to\n           give me a try out.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo observes her intently. She does not resemble any of the\n          characters in the script, but he no longer cares about that. At some\n\n           79\n\n          \n          point, Judit makes her appearance and gets to contemplate this scene\n          herself, displeased.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           I can come whatever day is convenient.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           You're already here. Let's read something.\n\n          \n\n          \n          It doesn't sound like \"let's read something\" but more like \"let's have\n          a drink.\"\n          They disappear through Mateo's office door.\n          Fade to black.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          58.

This,\n          under the control of Mateo Blanco, who does not stop speaking,\n          offering references, making ironic remarks, etc. All of this is seen\n          through the lens of a 16mm camera. (Images of contrasting colors).\n          The editing is vertiginous and doesn't at all respect continuity\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           85\n\n          \n          rules. The young Ernesto Junior is carrying the camera. We also see\n          this scene from the other side of the 16mm frame, from the point of\n          view of the main narration, which includes images of Ernesto Junior\n          filming with the 16mm camera.\n\n          \n\n          \n          On the inside frame of the dressing room mirror, there are photographs\n          of a young Shirley MacLaine, Kate Hepburn (young), Judy Holliday,\n          Audrey Hepburn, Goldie Hawn (in \"Butterflies Are Free\" or any other\n          film where she wears her hair long with a fringe). Icons of the\n          romantic comedy of today and yesteryear.\n          Over the voices of the characters that appear on frame, one hears\n          Harry's voice-off.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           OFF HARRY\n           I enjoyed making her up, styling her and dressing\n           her. Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of \"The\n           Apartment\" and the Audrey Hepburn of \"Breakfast at\n           Tiffany's\", or even Goldie Hawn...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Through the 16mm camera we can see the details of Lena's mutating\n          image, how it gets constructed. It is true that she reminds us of the\n          three actresses that Harry mentions in his voice-off. The members of\n          the team assisting her (hair-stylist, makeup artist, costume designer,\n          etc. and Lena herself) laugh heartily when they finish setting her up\n          with Goldie's blonde long-hair wig with a fringe.

SHOOTING. THE SET OF \"GIRLS AND SUITCASES\". INT. EFFECT\n\n\n          TO BE DETERMINED. 1994\n\n          \n\n          \n          Images from \"the making of\" shot by Ernesto Junior on 16mm, with high\n          grain and contrast, mixed with direct images from the establishing\n          shot of what is occurring.\n          The look of Lena's character is openly inspired by the Audrey Hepburn\n          of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", with Sabrina's hair style and loop\n          earrings (fringe and ponytail). She has also adopted the style of\n          Holy Golithly, her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that\n          characterizes modern girls from rural origins. The only difference is\n          a more visceral quality, Pina (Lena's character) is exalted and\n          Mediterranean, nothing like Hepburn. Her wardrobe is that of a modern\n          girl in `94, she is a professional model for cosmetic products. One\n          of her advertising photographs is framed and hangs on one of the walls\n          of the loft where she lives.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           88\n\n          \n\n          IN STUDIO-MADE KITCHEN, INSIDE THE COMPLEX \"PINA'S LOFT\".\n\n          \n\n          \n          Pina, Lena's character, is cutting tomatoes for a gazpacho, inside a\n          beautiful and shiny kitchen.\n          Pina is sad, probably thinking about \"all the times she has had\n          gazpacho with Ivan, the absent lover\". A tear drops from her face onto\n          the knife with which she's cutting the tomatoes. (In slow motion, one\n          sees the collision of the tear with the knife, in a cut-in). Hers is a\n          subtly comic sadness.\n\n          \n\n          \n          When she is done grinding up the tomatoes she takes a box of\n          sedatives, which she is carrying in her apron's pocket. She throws\n          all the pills into the gazpacho. She keeps two or three for herself.\n          (She may even say out loud, \"These are for me\".) With a wooden spoon,\n          she mixes the orange liquid, even though it only contains red\n          tomatoes.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The cut-ins are to be alternated with the \"making of\" of the cut-ins.\n          As well as Mateo's comments over the action, which instruct Lena how\n          to react.\n          The clap-board marks the end. It's the fifth take. Mateo says\n          \"Great\". Lena almost screams with joy.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          65. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SET. INT.

Everything is very professional, but\n          their demeanor radiates understanding, complicity and... a latent\n          desire.

Next to him, a young female lip-reader (A girl of neutral\n          aspect, but interesting, dressed as a glamour-less Russian.) is\n          translating for Ernesto Senior what Lena and Mateo are saying, as if\n          she were dubbing them. (The tone of her voice does not betray anything\n          suspicious. Everything sounds strictly professional, a director and an\n          actress who speak, in complicity, about their work.)

DAY. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena and Ernesto spend the weekend together, at an Ibizan house\n          minutely decorated with ethnic details. The decoration, super-\n          luxurious hippie, does not ring untrue to the Island's aesthetic.\n          Consider that Ernesto Senior and Lena are in the bedroom, on the bed,\n          making love luxuriously. There's no hurry, they pay careful attention\n          to all the details.\n          After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied. Or so it seems.\n          Ernesto remains spent on the bed, motionless. Lena gets up and goes\n          to the bathroom.\n          She opens the faucet and lets the water run.\n          Immediately, she is overtaken by vicious retching. On her knees, she\n          vomits into the toilet.\n          After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the\n          mirror. She wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet. She looks\n          very pale, the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face.\n          Quickly, she puts some makeup on. Enough to bring some color back to\n          her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes. Her eyes still\n          glimmer from the tears she's shed. More than in any other sequence,\n          it is here that Lena reveals her talent as an actress.\n          She exits the bathroom, wrapped in an elegant robe, a bit divine-\n          hippie.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          73.

It's impossible that you\n           wouldn't be pretty.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena sits on the bed, her back to Ernesto. He wraps his arm around\n          her waist while she makes some typical girl-gesture: looks at her\n          nails thinking of how she'll fix them, looks into her pocket mirror\n          and ponders the color of her hair, grabs a magazine on the nightstand\n          and thumbs through it, calls her mother to see how she's doing... Or,\n          simplest of all, takes a cigarette out of its box, looks for the\n          lighter, finds it and lights it. Everything is done sluggishly, she's\n          trying to take up as much time as possible.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Would you like a cigarette?\n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           No... thanks.\n\n           LENA\n           Do you know how many fucks we've had since we arrived\n           yesterday?\n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           (Smiles, like a champ) Six?\n\n           LENA\n           (Also smiles) Ten.\n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           With honours, yes?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           99\n\n          \n          Lena forces a smile, with her back to Ernesto.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Yes, I suppose so.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto Senior embraces her from behind and brings her toward him.

THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Only the indispensable members of the team and the actors are\n          clustered around the entrance hall and the elevator:\n          A scene is being shot where Pina exits the elevator and walks through\n          the entrance hall, in a hurry, toward the street. She bumps into\n          Chus, the porter, who is holding two metal objects (A Robert Indiana\n          \"LOVE\", impressive and metallic, and a Gucci alarm clock in the shape\n          of a G, the G is also metallic.)\n          Chus stops her, almost by force. She is a very \"communicative\" woman\n          and Pina attempts to get her off her back, as quickly as possible,\n          without being rude to her.\n          Chus shows her both objects, with a questioning look on her face.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           CHUS\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           100\n\n          \n           Look at what I've found on the sidewalk, they fell\n           from your terrace.\n\n           PINA\n           They are gifts from Mr. Ivan and I tossed them out.\n           He told me to keep them, but I don't want them!\n\n           CHUS\n           But you can't do that, Ms. Pina. You could have\n           killed somebody... You can't just throw things off the\n           terrace, much less if they are metal...\n\n           PINA\n           In Naples, on New Year's Eve, they even throw out\n           furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan... I carry it\n           in my blood.\n\n           CHUS\n           But this is not Naples, nor is today New Year's Eve...\n\n           PINA\n           I was anxious and throwing things relaxes me... Keep\n           them if you like.\n\n           CHUS\n           Thanks so much, Ms. Pina. But that's not right...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Pina exits the entrance hall, leaving the porter mid-sentence, while\n          the porter repeats, still, two more times.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           CHUS\n           It's not alright, Ms. Pina.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The scene is very simple, but it must exude charm. Chus is a natural\n          comic talent and Pina's character must act with a flippancy that plays\n          comically. At the same time, Lena is noticeably exhausted, both\n          physically and emotionally. Instead of lending the text lightness, she\n          brings it down. And she's aware of it.\n\n           101\n\n          \n          For the first time, Mateo does not hide his annoyance as a director\n          because the scene turns out badly, and as a lover because he is\n          jealous of her weekend with Ernesto Senior. Lena cannot stand to look\n          at him, she can't bare his angered expression.\n          Mateo takes her aside to a secluded corner of the set and away from\n          the team.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (Serious) Your tone is off, Magdalena.\n\n           LENA\n           (Very depressed) I know.\n\n           MATEO\n           (In a very low voice) What's wrong?\n\n           LENA\n           (Whispers, on the brink of tears) I'll tell you later.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo gestures for the Assistant to come over. Lena still has her\n          back toward the team. Mateo says something to the Assistant, who then\n          says out loud for all to hear:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ASSISTANT\n           We break for thirty minutes, it's snack time!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo meets with Lena in the darkest corner of the entrance hall.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          75.

All except Ernesto Junior who\n          remains inside and hides furtively behind a styrofoam panel, somewhat\n          removed from the couple, who cannot see him.\n          Mateo looks all around to ensure that they are alone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (With urgency) What's happened?\n\n           LENA\n           I've had a horrible weekend...\n\n           MATEO\n           But... we haven't rehearsed, so that you could rest!\n\n           LENA\n           Rest?

Everything seems chaotic, typical of\n          the end of the work day. The furniture is out of place, silverware\n          and plastic is all mixed together with electrical material and stage\n          equipment.

We watch this sequence through the 16mm camera, situated\n          just in front of the building's doorway.\n          We watch as Mateo appears on the sidewalk, walking toward the\n          building's doorway.\n          In front of the building, in the main narrative, we see Ernesto Junior\n          filming with his 16mm camera. He is hiding behind a bush, or cloaked\n          by a tree's shade.

Only half of their body is visible because the\n          roman shades are halfway drawn.

The second she discovers the camera, she\n          confronts it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Ernesto, what are you doing here?\n\n           ERNESTO JUNIOR\n           Working.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           107\n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Turn that off, you idiot! Hasn't Mateo forbidden you\n           to tape us outside the shooting?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Not far from them there is a garbage truck that is making horrendous\n          noises and makes it difficult to hear what they are saying. The truck\n          gets closer and the noises louder so that Ernesto Junior and Lena must\n          scream back and forth at each other.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO JUNIOR\n           My father has told me not to listen to him... he wants\n           to see everything.\n\n           LENA\n           You both have no scruples!\n\n           ERNESTO JUNIOR\n           Remember I am taping you.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena throws herself at Ernesto Junior and attempts to take the camera\n          from him. They struggle (the camera continues shooting, the images\n          move around, dizzyingly). Ernesto Junior manages to break free from\n          Lena. They are both out of breath. Ernesto backs up a few steps in\n          order to frame Lena again and so that he can focus her image. Lena\n          could take off running, but instead she stays right where she is; she\n          lets Ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly, while she\n          fixes her hair. She looks straight at the camera:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           (In a barrage) Listen carefully, Ernesto. Yes, I am\n           talking to you. (She points toward Mateo's house) I\n           was just with the man I love and I am the happiest\n           I've been all my life because he loves me too!\n           (screams) And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let\n\n           108\n\n          \n           you be very soon! There is no need to spy on me.\n           There is nothing left to hide!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          83. PRIVATE SCREENING ROOM, ERNESTO SENIOR'S MANSION. INT. DAY.\n\n\n          1994\n\n          \n\n          \n          (We see this at the same moment it's happening.)\n          The next day, Ernesto Senior is watching the previous night's scene on\n          the screen of his private projection room. We discover this when he\n          is halfway into it; the images pick the action up at the point when\n          Lena exits Mateo's house and confronts the camera, right after she has\n          attempted to grab the camera away from Ernesto Junior.\n          The shots in 16mm alternate with the shots in 35mm that belong to the\n          main narrative. The sound is uproarious, we can hear what they say in\n          a low volume, just as reference. Ernesto asks for the sound to be\n          muted so that the \"translator\" can do her job.\n          The \"lip reader\" tries, as usual, to be \"neutral and inexpressive\",\n          but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the\n          scene affect her. She acts as a mere vehicle, not part of the\n          conflict; nonetheless, she gets a little nervous. She is seated next\n          to the volcano: Ernesto Senior, stony, frozen, silent, and about to\n          explode.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          84. CONTINUED. SAME LOCATION.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Just a little earlier, right before the dizzying images appear on\n          screen, those caused by Lena's attempt to remove the camera from\n          Ernesto Junior's hands:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           109\n\n          \n          On the opposite end of where the screen is, behind the back of both\n          Ernesto and the translator, a door opens. Lena appears.\n          She watches the scene that is unfolding on screen as she lets her\n          voice rise to her mouth. (The entire dialogue in which she has\n          addressed Ernesto Senior directly is seen during the action taking\n          place in the projection room, not on the street.) At first, her voice\n          overlaps with that of the translator, who becomes instantly silent and\n          turns her head toward the door where Lena is standing. Lena is\n          dubbing herself.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           I was just with the man I love and I am the happiest\n           that I've been all my life because he loves me too!\n           And listen carefully, Ernesto! I will let you be very\n           soon! There is no need to spy on me. I don't have\n           anything left to hide!\n\n          \n\n          \n          The translator watches Lena and Ernesto Senior, who is still\n          motionless, watching the screen.\n          On screen, we see Lena walking, her back turned, for a good stretch.\n          With an equal obsession, she is followed down the street by the son\n          and in the screening room by the father.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          85. LENA'S BEDROOM, ERNESTO'S MANSION. DUSK FALLING. 1994\n\n          \n\n          \n          An avalanche of snow, on the television screen.\n          (Some short shots of both ice and whisky as they fall into a tall\n          glass function as an ellipsis between one scene and the next).\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           110\n\n          \n          Lena paces around anxiously in her bedroom. She attempts to focus on\n          a fashion magazine, but is unsuccessful. She takes a deep breath,\n          makes a decision. She opens the closet and takes out a small, weekend\n          suitcase. She fills it with her most indispensable clothes.\n\n          \n\n          \n          She exits her bedroom, on the top floor. In the hallway, only a few\n          meters separate the door to her bedroom from the stairway. There is a\n          small landing just before the top of the stairs, it has a small table\n          against the wall, a beautiful vase with flowers, a mirror and two\n          small sofas on either side of the small table. Ernesto is seated on\n          one of them, holding a glass of whisky in his right hand. It cannot\n          be the first he's had. One could say he's been waiting some time now\n          for Lena's exit, a bottle and an icebox keeping him company. Lena\n          walks a few steps. Se approaches Ernesto, but keeps her distance.\n          She speaks to him in passing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           (Suitcase in hand) I am leaving, Ernesto. I am leaving\n           you.\n\n           ERNESTO SENIOR\n           (Cold, drunk, contemptuous) You are not going anywhere.\n\n           LENA\n           And how will you stop me?\n\n          \n\n          \n          (Every single one of the words in this dialogue sounds laded and slow)\n          No sooner has she said it than Lena realizes that it has been an\n          unnecessary provocation. But it's too late to take back what's been\n          said. Ernesto Senior shoots her a deathly look. But then gets up and\n          changes his expression to calm her.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           (Pleading) Lena, please.\n\n           111\n\n          \n          One more time, Ernesto begs forgiveness, but Lena doesn't want to see\n          him or hear him. She turns and begins to descend the stairs. The\n          first step.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto approaches her slowly, from behind. He is still pleading, as\n          in a litany: \"Lena, please\". \"Lena...\"\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86. CONTINUED. ON THE STAIRWAY.\n\n          \n\n          \n          But Lena keeps her back to his supplication, descends one more step,\n          her second one. Suddenly, without any change in his expression,\n          Ernesto pushes her with a quick and unexpected movement of his arm.\n          Lena loses her balance and falls, rolling, bouncing violently against\n          the edges of the steps until her whole body hits the floor at the foot\n          of the stairs. During the time the fall takes, Ernesto doesn't move,\n          he watches her fall, bump by bump. He waits until she's on the floor\n          and she casts him a fulminating glance, before he reacts.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87. CONTINUED.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena lands on the floor, broken and stunned by the blows.\n          She lifts her head and attempts to move, but can't. Ernesto descends\n          quickly and comes to her side. He begs, calmly, without violence, for\n          her not to move. Lena cannot stand, her battered body only allows her\n          to drag herself toward the door, like a reptile.\n          Ernesto takes her, delicately, in his arms. Lena gazes at him in\n          horror.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           112\n\n          \n\n          88. PUERTA DE HIERRO MANSION. LAWN. EXT. NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          He exits into the night, onto a green lawn, with the woman in his\n          arms, they look like two newlyweds. The dogs, disconcerted, follow\n          them in procession, they intuit that something is not right.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Once inside the car (none of the hired help is there that night), he\n          opens the gate from the inside and exits onto the highway.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89. HIGHWAY. EXT. NIGHT. 1994.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena is lying on the back seat, pale and in pain, but she's not\n          complaining. Ernesto is driving faster than 180 Km/hr. He alerts a\n          pair of patrolmen. When he realizes he's being followed, he increases\n          his speed. The patrolmen signal with their lights for him to stop on\n          the curb, but Ernesto Martel ignores their signal until the police car\n          catches up to him and forces him to stop.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90. A DIFFERENT SEGMENT OF THE HIGHWAY. EXT. NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The two patrolmen get out of their vehicle and head, enraged, toward\n          Ernesto. They gesture for him to lower his window.\n          Ernesto lowers the window, relaxed, despite the situation. The two\n          patrolmen, especially the one who calls the shots, recriminate him,\n          their voices raised, for all the infractions he has just committed.\n          They are very agitated and they quickly notice the high level of\n          alcohol emitted by the driver's breath.\n          Knocked out on the back seat, Lena observes the whole scene. Her face\n          is contorted with pain and anxiety.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           113\n\n          \n          (A river of cars continues to pass nearby.)\n          Using a nasty tone, one of the policemen asks Ernesto for his\n          documents.\n          The following conversation takes place while the policemen verify the\n          vehicle's documents. Ernesto explains to them with a common sense\n          that's disarming:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO SENIOR\n           We have to get to the hospital. My wife is badly hurt...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena moans in affirmation. The Policeman takes a look inside the car,\n          in order to ascertain that she is indeed not faking it...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           POLICEMAN\n           What's happened?\n\n           ERNESTO\n           I was in the living room and, since we weren't\n           planning to go out, I started drinking early. I am\n           pretty drunk, as you may notice. Suddenly, I heard a\n           thump, I ran to the stairs and there she was. She\n           tripped and fell down the stairs...\n\n           POLICEMAN\n           Is this true, Madam?\n\n           LENA\n           Yes... Can't you leave the paperwork for later?\n\n           POLICEMAN\n           Your husband can't drive in this condition!\n\n           ERNESTO SENIOR\n           What do you mean?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto attempts to start the car, but the other policeman stops him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           114\n\n          \n\n           POLICEMAN\n           You're crazy!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena moans inside the car. She may even start crying.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Please!\n\n          \n\n          \n          She says this to the two men.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           POLICEMAN\n           Get out of there!

Let him drive!\n\n           POLICEMAN\n           (To Ernesto, paternalistic and contemptuous) Get down\n           and sit in the back, with your wife!\n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           (Threatening) If anything happens (referring to Lena),\n           you better be ready... You have no idea who I am!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Taking his time, Ernesto vacates the driver's seat and sits in the\n          back, next to Lena.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           POLICEMAN\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           115\n\n          \n           I will pretend that I didn't hear you. I will also\n           pretend I noticed neither how drunk you are nor your\n           affronts to authority, Mr. Martel.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Sulking and with an alcohol-driven affection (and casual) he asks\n\n          LENA:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           Are you all right?\n\n           LENA\n           (Screams) No!

HOSPITAL ENTRANCE. EXT. NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto's car, driven by the patroleman, arrives to the entrance of a\n          hospital.\n          Cut to.\n          Immediately, at the Emergency Room, some male nurses arrive with a\n          stretcher.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          92. HOSPITAL. INT. NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          X-Rays of arms, legs and head, along with all other routine tests, in\n          short shots. A broken leg. Various contusions. A cast must be\n          applied.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           116\n\n          \n          The image of the X-Ray takes up the whole screen. We may hear the\n          nurses giving instructions. \"Don't move\", \"Don't breathe\", etc.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          93. HOSPITAL. INT. NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The last thing we see is the X-ray of the head, which dissolves over\n          Lena's head and face as she asks a nurse for the telephone, telling\n          her that she needs to make an urgent phone call.\n          Ernesto censures her with his look. Once the last X-ray has been\n          taken, the nurse brings her a supplementary handset and plugs it in.\n          She hands the handset to Lena.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           ERNESTO\n           You really can't wait?\n\n           LENA\n           (Defiant) No.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Ernesto looks at her not knowing what to expect. Nonetheless, he\n          remains seated next to her. Lena doesn't react, she doesn't care if\n          he overhears the conversation, she almost wants him to.\n          The brutal beating to which she has been victim is an inescapable\n          reality that gives her an edge over Ernesto, an edge of which she\n          intends to take advantage.

DAY. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          They enter the warehouse, temporarily turned into a studio. (The\n          darkness is almost absolute. A huge door opens. The silhouettes of\n          Ernesto Senior and Lena, on a wheelchair, enter.)\n          The dark, vast space is pierced by the blinding light of a doorway,\n          which both frames and silhouettes the figures of Ernesto and Lena,\n          like cut-outs; creating a powerful image. Epic and terrible.\n          They bump into some of the members of the team, who begin their work\n          day, slothfully.\n          When Mateo discovers the pair, he approaches them immediately.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          98.

The entire decoration of the\n          office is casual and chaotic, not luxurious, austere, nothing like\n          Lena's dressing room. An enormous drip eats away at one of the\n          corners of the room.\n          Lena is sitting across from him, on a wheelchair, and seated on an\n          ugly armchair, Ernesto Senior. Judit is also present, she's standing.\n          They have just finished talking. Lena has told the version that she\n          and Ernesto Senior agreed on.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           121\n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           ... And that's it.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo looks at them in disbelief. Judit, still as a statue, waits for\n          the others' reactions. Lena breathes, expectantly. And Ernesto\n          Senior looks uncomfortable and insecure, he is used to being the one\n          who calls the shots; the inverse role, that of listener, disorients\n          him and puts him in a bad mood.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you decide.\n\n           MATEO\n           (Containing his rage) Decide, what?! I can't move\n           from one shot where you are walking normally to\n           another one where you are wearing a cast! How long\n           must you wear the cast?\n\n           LENA\n           Three weeks.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo lets out a huff...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           (To Ernesto Senior) Can we stop for those three\n           weeks? With pay for the team, of course.\n\n           ERNESTO S.\n           If there is no other option!\n\n           MATEO\n           (A bit agitated) I hate stopping! Movies, when you\n           pick them back up, are no longer the same!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Looks at Judit and Ernesto Senior.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           122\n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (Dryly) Do you mind if I speak to Lena alone for a\n           moment?\n\n          \n\n          \n          It's not a question but a demand.\n          Judit shoots him a look of recrimination, as if saying \"This is not\n          the moment for that\", but she cannot do anything to stop him.\n          Ernesto Senior is also not pleased (but he knows he cannot say no, and\n          this irritates him even more). He glances first at Lena, who orders\n          him with her own glance to accept, and then looks at Judit, who warmly\n          invites him to exit with her.\n          For some reason, Ernesto Senior empathizes with that woman.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          99.

DAY. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit and Ernesto Senior exit the office and hang around not far from\n          to the door. They smoke, perhaps. They are both restless. They look\n          at each other as if seeking some kind of understanding, despite their\n          differences. And they find it. They are joined by their jealousy.\n          At the other end of the warehouse, like a mirage amongst the shadows,\n          Pina's loft appears, majestic, ramshackle and mysterious. Ernesto\n          contemplates it without understanding it, but is affected by its\n          presence. He is unable to understand the essence of this make-belief\n          game, but it's the first time he begins to grasp its hermetic\n          fascination.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          100.

Mateo touches with his lips on every\n          one of them, kissing them delicately.

On the\n          surface of the Moviola screen, the reflection of Mateo's face is\n          barely visible over the first set of images screened.)\n\n          \n\n          \n          A wooden landing and stairway in a building of the old Madrid.

(She is dressed as she was when she\n          came out of the entrance hall in the previous scene with Chus.

She bumps into Pina by the elevator, Pina does not\n          know her. Julieta knocks on the studio's door (just as Pina had done\n          earlier), she doesn't get an answer. She notices the note that Pina\n          has just affixed on the door. She takes it down and reads it, much to\n          Pina's bafflement, who has been watching her from the other side of\n          the landing. After reading it, Julieta crumples it up. Pina cannot\n          believe it.

The\n          actress playing Chon jokes around with the costume team, they laugh.\n          But no one pays attention to the others. Edurne, in a close-up,\n          retouches one of Pina's eyes. The mouth as well. Chon stops laughing\n          so that the hair-stylist may shape her hair.\n          All the images are very brief... The score predominates, the ambient\n          sounds of the activities of the different teams is heard more like a\n          whisper. The scene must not last longer than a minute.

On the other side of the peephole, Chon's exalted eyes\n          appear. Chon is a Better Midler type, in her 40s, that kind of\n          extroverted woman who at first glance appears chubby but isn't quite\n          so. She is wearing designer clothes, despite the fact that her\n          demeanor is direct and crass. Both of them, Pina and Chon, are tired\n          and hysterical, which each one of them interprets in her own way.\n          Pina opens the door and Chon enters. Even though they are good\n          friends, the last thing Pina is in the mood for is to see Chon, much\n          less an over-excited Chon with \"problems\".\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           PINA\n           (Whispers) What a drag!

It is a\n          special and intimate place, like an enormous grotto, where the sky is\n          its ceiling and the mountains one of its walls.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena and Mateo exit a bungalow and get into a rented car, a red Opel\n          Corsa, not in very good shape.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           138\n\n          \n\n          114. EL GOLFO BEACH. EXT. AT DAY'S END. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          On the peak of a reddish rock, on Golfo Beach, Mateo takes photographs\n          of the natural wonders surrounding him. Next to him, Lena\n          contemplates the view.\n          What Mateo sees with his camera:\n          a) Wine colored rocks\n          b) The yellow-green lake circumscribed by a rope that has become\n          white, against the black sand.\n          c) The black sand of the enormous beach, licked by the shimmering foam\n          of the waves.\n          d) The rocky walls enveloping the beach, eroded through centuries by\n          the wind on the surface of which it has created peaks and valleys\n          resembling the jutted edge of a watch cog.\n\n          \n\n          \n          One of the images captures part of a wine-colored rock. Below it, the\n          infinite surface of the black beach, licked by the white foam of the\n          waves. In the backdrop, an immense limestone wall, its surface full of\n          pit holes where the wind circulates.\n          The sequence ends with a close-up of the click of Mateo's camera's\n          shutter, opening and closing like an owl's eye.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          115. SOUVENIR AND PHOTOGRAPHY STORE. LANZAROTE. INT. DAY. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo-Harry and Lena pick up their photos at the store's counter. The\n          owner of the shop hands them to him, he is an attractive and bohemian\n          middle-aged man.\n          Mateo opens the envelope impatiently, he wants to make sure that his\n          photographs are, in effect, the ones inside it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           139\n\n          \n          He looks at the last one closely, the landscape with the rocks, the\n          beach, the foam, etc. Somewhere on the vast black-sand beach one can\n          make out a couple, their size is tiny compared to the immensity of the\n          beach. The two are melded into a tight embrace. The beach is\n          deserted. Mateo had not been aware of them when he took the\n          photograph and is overtaken by his discovery.\n          He shows it to Lena. Half-joking.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           Look. It's us. (I thought it was empty)\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo asks the bohemian Attendant for a larger print.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          116. MATEO AND LENA, INSIDE THE CAR, ON THE HIGHWAY. EXT. DAY.\n\n\n          1994\n\n          \n\n          \n          They go through various traffic circles. Mateo comments that it is\n          \"the island of the useless traffic circles\". \"That's part of its\n          charm\", comments Lena.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          117. TRAFFIC CIRCLE WITH CESAR MANRIQUE SCULPTURE. EXT. DAY.\n\n\n          1994\n\n          \n\n          \n          They stop on one of the stop signs at the traffic circle. In the\n          center there is a huge mobile sculpture by Cesar Manrique, rocked by\n          the wind.\n          Mateo and Lena exit the car to take pictures of themselves. Their\n          faces close together, their eyes happy. The sculpture turning around\n          itself produces a strange screeching sound.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           140\n\n          \n\n          118. BUNGALOW. FAMARA BEACH. INT. DUSK OR NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Many days have passed. Mateo's hair is longer and he appears more\n          tan, the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also\n          affected Magdalena's appearance, now much more savage, but also more\n          serene and more humble. She is dressed in cheap clothing, which she\n          has bought on the island (and which fits her marvelously) and her hair\n          is pulled up into a messy bun.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The photograph, enlarged, presides on top of a small table where Mateo\n          writes. The picture is leaning against the wall. It's the only image\n          inside the bungalow. The photograph is a clear metaphor for the\n          mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo\n          and Lena and of their fusion.\n\n          \n\n          \n          While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in\n          the bathtub. The two wear T-shirts, comfortable and sporty clothes.\n          (On the tape-deck one hears La Lupe singing: ... \"porque hay un hombre\n          para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre, y nosotros somos,\n          nosotros somos... la pareja\" [because there is only one man for each\n          woman and only one woman for each man, and we are, and we are... the\n          couple]). Mateo and Magdalena, the couple.\n\n          \n\n          \n          In the bungalow there isn't much furniture; there's a large couch on\n          which they can lie comfortably, a short table, along with the wooden\n          table on which Mateo writes. Some armchair and lamps. And a tape-\n          deck.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           141\n\n          \n\n          119. BUNGALOW. INT. DUSK OR NIGHT. 1994\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Engulfed by the couch, Mateo and Lena are absorbed watching, on a\n          small television, a broadcast of \"Voyage in Italy\" (Roberto\n          Rossellini's).\n          The scene they are watching is set in a place where a group of men are\n          working on some excavation. The married couple (in the midst of their\n          breakup), played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, is on a tourist\n          trip in that area of Italy and they have gone to visit the excavation.\n          One of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in\n          excavating part of a city that had been buried, centuries ago, by the\n          lethal eruption of the Vesuvius.\n          At that moment, the men who are working on the excavation begin, bit\n          by bit, to uncover a couple, a man and a woman, sleeping in an\n          embrace, whom the eruption had taken unaware, leaving them preserved\n          in this position for centuries.\n          Ingrid Bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an\n          eternal embrace. She compares it to her own marriage, destroyed by\n          their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between\n          them. She walks away from the place, unable to contain her tears.\n          The scene affects Magdalena and Mateo as much as it had Ingrid\n          Bergman.\n          Mateo and Lena instinctively embrace each other, seeking refuge in\n          each other, their posture echoes that of the calcined couple.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Suddenly, Mateo breaks their embrace. He positions the camera on top\n          of the table where he writes, not far from where the image of the\n          other \"embrace\" sits. He points it toward the couch and he presses\n          the automatic button. And they take a picture together, locked in an\n          embrace.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           142\n\n          \n\n          120. PUBLIC PARK. MADRID. EXT.

You can't leave me hanging!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry takes a deep breath. At this stage of the narrative, it is only\n          understandable that Diego would want to know everything. But it pains\n          him to think of what is still left to tell.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Without realizing, a month had elapsed... I knew that\n           sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept\n           postponing it. I was only worried about you and your\n           mother. I had not even said goodbye and you were still\n           suffering from your allergy problem when we left... I can\n           imagine Judit was furious with me.\n\n           DIEGO\n           You can't imagine how much.\n\n           HARRY\n           I was planning to return soon to finish the editing...\n           and to explain things to your mother. But Magdalena\n           decided she'd wait for me on the island. She couldn't\n           stand the thought of seeing Ernesto again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           143\n\n          \n\n          121. OFFICE FOR THE FAMARA BUNGALOWS. INT.

He grabs a newspaper.\n          In English:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           Sorry to interrupt...

He shows it to Lena. On the Entertainment page, an\n          ad for Mateo's movie (Opening Soon). The ad is a close-up of her, in\n          her role as Pina, in the movie. Lena is stunned.

A father and his\n          young son toss their kites into the wind.\n          Lounging on lounge chairs, on a cobble-stone area before one reaches\n          the sand, Lena and Mateo-Harry are reading the news of the opening of\n          the film in a National newspaper. They only have one copy and Mateo's\n          eyes are transfixed on the news.\n          The note accompanying the event says, in bold type:\n          \"The financier, Ernesto Martel, has managed to gather all of Madrid\n          for his first film as a producer, missing are only its director and\n          star.\"\n          Two pictures accompany the news of the event. Printed next to them,\n          there is a review entitled, \"Disaster.\"\n          Mateo throws the newspaper away from him, enraged. He refuses to read\n          the review.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           146\n\n          \n          The wind dishevels the newspaper pages. Lena rises and chases the\n          pages that fly, like kites, slightly above the ground.\n          In mid-flight, she catches the Entertainment page and reads it as she\n          approaches Mateo, who watches the ocean, feeling impotent, furious,\n          unable to quite grasp what is happening.\n          Lena sits down next to him, still reading.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (Disconsolate) What does it say?\n\n           LENA\n           That the only intelligent thing we have done has been\n           not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic,\n           that you seem like a first-time director and that you\n           lack talent. At the end, it wonders who might have\n           made your first films. Never before has such a\n           resounding downfall been witnessed...

At the bottom of\n          the drawer one can begin to see Luis' (the editor) notebook. Diego is\n          holding a Dymo label machine, (this Dymo has appeared in previous\n          scenes) with all of its keyboard buttons, corresponding to the regular\n          alphabet, in Braille. He is writing, in Braille, \"Famara \u00ad Lanzarote\n          94\" so that he can stick the raised title onto the old envelope.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           And mom, did she call you back?\n\n           HARRY\n           No.\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Can't understand, he's almost indignant) Why?\n\n           HARRY\n           She was pissed, I suppose.\n\n           DIEGO\n           I remember that time, it was while I was undergoing\n           treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis. It was a\n           horrible time for me... Not just because of the illness,\n           my mother was like a crazy woman... I had just seen \"The\n           Exorcist\" and, for some time, I believed she was\n           possessed...\n\n           HARRY\n           (Smiles pathetically) I was the demon, Diego. And I\n           am sorry. I suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not\n           sure I had a choice...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego thinks about this.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n\n           149\n\n          \n           (Emotionally exhausted) No matter how upset she was,\n           she should have alerted you to what was happening.\n\n           HARRY\n           The fact is she never did, and we've never spoken of\n           it. Neither one of us has broached the topic.\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Surprised) And you weren't curious?...\n\n           HARRY\n           (Emphatically) Me? Curiosity was killing me! For\n           two days I called both your mother and Luis non-stop,\n           the editor (says it agitated), but neither of them\n           answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next\n           day so that I could witness what was happening for\n           myself!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          126. RESTAURANT.

Their table is beside a long sliding-door window\n          that overlooks the valley. A group of rocks seem to grow next to the\n          window as if they were plants made of stone. The view of the valley\n          is breathtaking.\n          There are few patrons inside the restaurant. Perhaps a foreign\n          couple, sitting far from Lena and Mateo. A waiter brings their first\n          course. They are drinking wine.\n          Lena appears melancholic and fearful.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           How did you meet Ernesto Senior?\n\n           LENA\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           150\n\n          \n           (It's not a topic she likes, but she doesn't hesitate\n           to answer.) I was one of his secretaries.\n\n           MATEO\n           And... how did you end up with him? You fell in love?\n\n           LENA\n           He was very generous with me and my family. My father\n           was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital\n           and Ernesto took care of everything... He paid for\n           everything... And he made sure that my parents could\n           return to their home town and that they lacked nothing...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo imagines the situation, it upsets him. He is perturbed by the\n          very idea of Lena's past with Ernesto, but he doesn't want to upset\n          her on the night before his departure. They have gone out to dinner\n          with just the opposite intent.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (Lovingly) Pardon me, I have no right to ask you about\n           that time in your life.\n\n           LENA\n           It's only natural that you would want to know. And I\n           don't want any skeletons between us. (Unguarded) I\n           would like to be able to forget all that, but you have\n           the right to ask.\n\n           MATEO\n           (Assuring her) No. I do not have any right. For me,\n           you were born the day you came for the audition. You\n           looked at me, I saw your face and... I was left\n           hypnotized.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Lena smiles. She is both comforted and relived by remembering that\n          moment.\n\n           151\n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           I remember your face perfectly. I think I fell in\n           love with the way you looked at me. I thought: this\n           man will be my salvation.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo is moved by her use of those terms to speak of their first\n          meeting.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          126.

We notice another car which we\n          will have the occasion to recall in the future, the camera gives it\n          just a passing glance.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           LENA\n           (Childish) It's the first time we part...\n\n           MATEO\n           (Pampering) Either way, I will return next weekend.\n           But if you are going to be worried, you should come\n           with me.\n\n           LENA\n           No... I will be better off here.\n\n          \n\n          \n          And she smiles, as if the worry has already passed, so as not to\n          disquiet Mateo.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           152\n\n          \n\n          127.

A set of lights first betrays the\n          presence of a car that appears from the left. Mateo yields to it, and\n          briefly kisses Magdalena on the lips.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo continues on his way, a short instant later, as he enters the\n          traffic circle, an SUV moving at full speed crashes into them.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           153\n\n          \n          Everything happens very fast. From inside the car, without any\n          particular attention to Lena or Mateo, the screen fills up with light,\n          noise and darkness. All the different noises form a deafening magma.\n\n          \n\n          \n          At the center of the traffic circle, Cesar Manrique's sculpture\n          rotates, propelled by the wind.\n\n          \n\n          \n          In any case, we will also shoot the crash from the outside. And\n          although it will not be obvious at first sight, the back side of\n          Mateo's car is illuminated by the headlights of a car that we never\n          quite see, but which has been a witness to the accident.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          128.

One also hears the sound of a second vehicle, which\n          approaches and stops, and something that sounds like a door opening\n          and a moan.\n          The camera only focuses on the sculpture, swaying in the wind.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          129.

Through the window we can\n          see the local surroundings. The walls are a pastel color, green or\n          blue, an aquatic color, and they have various spots where humidity has\n          seeped through.\n          Other than the psychiatrist, there is another doctor present,\n          explaining the situation to Judit.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           PSYCHIATRIST\n           We call him by his name, but he doesn't respond to it.\n           He insists Mateo has died.\n\n           JUDIT\n           Images are the source of his work... and to live in the\n           dark, I suppose that's death to him...

It's the result of\n           a lesion to the occipital lobe, the intelligent part\n           of the brain, which has the role of processing all\n           visual information.

Judit helps Mateo out.\n          Mateo remains glued to the ground. He can't move. Judit stares at\n          him. Even though Mateo had renounced being Mateo, he has inherited\n          his most painful memories. Being near the RECEPTION bungalow, and\n          thus near the bungalow where he lived with Magdalena, generates some\n          kind of spasm in him that keeps him from moving. He feels an intense\n          heat (inside and outside of him), as if he were approaching a bonfire\n          the flames of which would slowly scorch him, were he to move.\n          (Perhaps we'll have to inlay the image with the flames of an imaginary\n          conflagration).

NEXT TO THE BUNGALOWS. EXT.\n\n\n          DAY. 1994.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo and little Diego walk only a few meters past bungalow number\n          two, where he lived with Magdalena. At that moment they are walking\n          facing the wind, a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their\n          clothes. It is as if nature itself wanted to keep Mateo from walking\n          away from the bungalow where he loved Lena. From this point on, his\n          life will become just that, an endless battle against the elements and\n          against the memory of Lena.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           160\n\n          \n          Little Diego's voice distracts him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGUITO\n           Look... There are kites!\n\n          \n\n          \n          At times little Diego forgets that Mateo cannot see. So he points\n          toward the sky of a nearby beach, whose surface is dotted by various\n          kites.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo is grateful for the life-affirming sound of the boy's voice and\n          so he allows himself to be towed.\n          The wind's violent sweep over all the different elements that compose\n          the landscape creates a symphony of strange sounds.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n          138. BUNGALOW No.2. FAMARA. INT. AND EXT. DAY. 1994.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit, using the key she was handed at the Reception Desk, opens the\n          door to bungalow number two. She enters into what had been Mateo and\n          Lena's love nest. She takes the entire space in with one glance; she\n          is overtaken, as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space.\n          She imagines Mateo and Lena filling up the space with their presence.\n          (A strange modesty comes over her, but her curiosity is greater).\n          Lena's spirit (at least in Judit's mind) hangs in the air, but in the\n          material surrounding her absence is absolute. Those who took her body\n          did not leave any trace of Lena. Not a single object, not a single\n          dress. Nothing. Ernesto Senior's cohorts (or Ernesto himself) took\n          all of her things.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo's clothes and things are found piled up in a closet. Yet the\n          table where he sat to write remains intact. On it, the photograph of\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           161\n\n          \n          the embrace on Golfo Beach still rests, along with his notebook, blank\n          pages and some envelopes.\n          Judit observes the photograph on Golfo Beach as if it were alive,\n          still palpitating. And she imagines that the two lovers, locked in an\n          embrace, lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand, are Mateo\n          and Lena.\n\n          \n\n          \n          She opens the desk's drawer and, much to her surprise, finds it\n          overflowing with torn photographs of Mateo and Lena, shuffled in no\n          particular order (one might say they had been thrown violently into\n          the drawer. The violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has\n          left its pulsating mark).\n          Judit picks up all the pieces, slowly and delicately, and she places\n          them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to Mateo's notebook.\n          Her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the\n          expression on her face.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          139. FAMARA BEACH. EXT. DAY. 1994.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          At the base of the complex, on one end of the beach, the car that\n          brought them is waiting. Judit places the bags with Mateo's\n          belongings, which she has just carried from the bungalow, inside the\n          trunk. She raises her head, emotionally exhausted. From where she\n          stands she can see little Diego, ecstatic, in front of a group of\n          surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of\n          kites (around eight or ten) darting through the sky like flying fish.\n          Mateo is motionless, in front of the sea, soaking up its strength.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit's pain is at odds with the boy's joy and the overwhelming\n          vitality that the place exudes at that very moment.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           162\n\n          \n          She begins to walk toward Mateo and little Diego. Once she is a few\n          meters away, she observes a surfer riding a wave. In the foreground\n          of her line of sight stands Mateo, out of focus. As he comes into\n          focus, Judit yells out to him:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Harry! Harry Caine!\n\n          \n\n          \n          It seems as though she is invoking the wind (a hurricane) which moves\n          the waves along with the expert surfers riding them.\n          When he hears Judit's voice, Mateo turns to face in her direction and\n\n          RESPONDS:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           We're here, Judit! (And raises his hand like a child)\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit approaches them, petrified with emotion. The wind tears tears\n          from her eyes.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           We have to go, Harry.\n\n           HARRY\n           (To the boy) Let's go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.\n\n           DIEGUITO\n           (Protests, politely) Can't we stay a little longer?\n\n           HARRY\n           No. We must obey your mother... You've had enough wind\n           for one day...\n\n           DIEGUITO\n           But I'm already all better!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           163\n\n          \n          Judit walks in front of the blind man and the boy, her eyes glitter.\n          Mateo has responded to her call, and that has filled her with\n          uncontrollable emotion. At this very moment she decides that she will\n          dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man. This is how it\n          will be.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          140. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego is still sitting on the floor, next to the brown envelope. He\n          sticks on the Braille title, \"Famara. Lanzarote 94.\" In front of him,\n          spread on the floor like a puzzle, lie the pieces of various embraces\n          between Mateo and Lena (like archeological finds, like the Minoan\n          paintings in Crete). The pieces begin to join with one another, an\n          order is established and, soon, the better part of the picture is\n          clear. There are four photographs where, regardless of the missing\n          pieces, one can make out the image. Two are of embraces and the rest\n          are of domestic scenes. The scratches on the four photographs reveal\n          the passing of time.\n          Neither of the two men speak. Mateo remains seated at his desk.\n          Pensive.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          141. HARRY'S HOME. INT.

On the spines, the\n          titles are written in Braille.

(When Diego had opened it\n          before, we had been able to see that along with the photographs there\n          were other objects, for example, Luis' notebook (the editor). Diego\n          had not mentioned any of this to Harry). Harry pokes around in the\n          drawer with his hands, finds the notebook.\n          He grabs it. He opens it on top of his desk. He touches the\n          different pages. The tips of his finger tips run over the numbers\n          corresponding to the sequences, the shots, the selected takes,\n          attempting to find a message.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          149. DIEGO'S ROOM. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry walks over to Diego's room with the notebook in hand. The boy\n          is naked, drying himself with a towel after his shower.\n          Harry asks permission to enter.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           May I come in?\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Drying himself) Yes, come in!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Not giving him time to get dressed, Harry hands him the notebook.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years ago. At\n           that time I didn't even bother to open it, I didn't\n           want to know anything about him. I am now thinking\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           170\n\n          \n           that perhaps he had something to tell me. Would you\n           mind seeing if beyond the takes and all of that there\n           is something else written?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego looks through it carefully. The last pages are empty. The rest\n          only have the numbers pertaining to the sequences, the shots, and the\n          selected takes, like we have seen in the sequence with the Moviola.\n          Although, there is something written on the last page. \"My new\n          number: 91 6994079.\"\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           At the end he says this is my new number, a number's\n           written down.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry hands him his mobile phone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Call him, please!\n\n           DIEGO\n           Right now? It's too early.\n\n           HARRY\n           It doesn't matter.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego dials the number and hands the phone to Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           May I get dressed? I'm naked...\n\n           HARRY\n           Oh, I'm sorry.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He turns around and leaves.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           171\n\n          \n\n          150. HARRY'S HOME. DEN. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          He exits the bedroom and heads for his dark den.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           (On the phone) Could I speak to Luis, please?\n\n           WOMAN'S VOICE\n           (Surprised) Luis died six years ago!\n\n           HARRY\n           Oh, I am so sorry... I had no idea!\n\n           VOICE\n           It was cancer. I'm his widow. Who are you?\n\n           HARRY\n           Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films...\n\n           VOICE\n           (More serene) Mateo Blanco! Luis spoke to me about\n           you.

I would have liked to speak to him...\n\n           VOICE\n           He would have liked so too!

LIVING ROOM, HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego is in the kitchen. He is preparing breakfast, both for himself\n          and Mateo.\n          Harry, heavy-hearted, approaches the kitchen, pensive. A half-hearted\n          \"happy birthday\" escapes Diego's lips. Harry doesn't react, perhaps\n          he hasn't heard him. Noticing the look on his face Diego is not eager\n          to insist.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           What's going on?\n\n           HARRY\n           My editor. I just found out he died six years ago...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego remains silent and lets Harry continue talking.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           Not long before he died he sent me this notebook. But\n           I didn't want to know anything about him, I also\n           didn't know he was dying... and I put it away... until\n           today... His wife just told me he would have liked to\n           speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me the\n           notebook... but I didn't give him the chance.\n\n           DIEGO\n           Had you spoken since the accident?\n\n           173\n\n          \n\n           HARRY\n           No. Never.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego places plates with toast and juice on the table. He serves\n          Harry some coffee and adds sugar.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           The coffee is in front of you...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Harry finds the cup easily.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Are you OK? Would you like me to stay here?\n\n           HARRY\n           No, no... You're heading out?\n\n           DIEGO\n           My mother arrives today. I would like to be home when\n           she arrives.\n\n           HARRY\n           I didn't know she was arriving...\n\n           DIEGO\n           I didn't either, she left me a message this morning.\n           She's coming to celebrate your birthday, with us...\n\n           HARRY\n           It's my birthday?\n\n           DIEGO\n           It seems so. Today's the (he tells him the day), does\n           that sound right?\n\n           HARRY\n           Yes. A day like today, fifty-one years ago, I entered the\n           world.\n\n           DIEGO\n\n           174\n\n          \n           Happy birthday!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          152. JUDIT AND DIEGO'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit returns from location scouting. She enters her house. She hugs\n          her son, effusively.\n\n          \n\n          \n          She drops a large suitcase, with wheels. (The sequence takes place in\n          various rooms in the house. From the foyer she should move toward the\n          bedroom or the kitchen, where she makes herself some tea, or where she\n          opens bags full of food that she's brought, typical to the region\n          she's just visited. (She looks inside the refrigerator and doesn't\n          find anything). Things like that.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my son?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Yes.\n\n           JUDIT\n           I was very worried about you!\n\n           DIEGO\n           Mateo has looked after me day and night...\n\n           JUDIT\n           Mateo? You're not calling him Harry...?\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego had not realized.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Yes...\n\n           JUDIT\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           175\n\n          \n           Today's his birthday, we must get him something... What\n           have you been up to all this time?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Nothing... Watching movies... and talking...\n\n           JUDIT\n           (As if it were something strange) Talking?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Yes...\n\n           JUDIT\n           What about?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Mom, please!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit looks at her son. She finds him different. As if all the\n          confidences shared with Harry had left a physical and visible mark on\n          him. Diego seems to guess what his mother is thinking.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           OK. So what happened to you? (Sort of joking) I\n           don't know if I should believe the thing about the\n           stomach flu, you two used that as an excuse in a\n           script...\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Elusive) (I suffered) ... an accident. But I would\n           rather not speak of that right now...\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Irritated, by the surprise) What kind of accident?\n\n           DIEGO\n           It's hard to explain.\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Orders him, annoyed) Try to! I am not that stupid!\n\n           DIEGO\n\n           176\n\n          \n           Let's leave it for another time, yes? I am all well now.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit gets the sense that she can no longer speak to her son in the\n          same way that she could before she left on her trip. Those two weeks\n          have irreversibly changed him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           What's wrong with you, Diego?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Nothing. I'm doing just fine. I'm going to buy a\n           present for Mateo.\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Repeats) For Mateo...\n\n           DIEGO\n           Alright, Harry.\n\n          \n\n          \n          (Offended, she doesn't want her son to think she is a drag, so she\n          makes an effort not to bombard him with questions)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Call him however you wish. That's the advantage of\n           having two names.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego disappears and leaves her in mid-sentence.\n          (Is this his way of avenging himself? Perhaps his reaction is unfair,\n          but he cannot stand to stay there with his mother, answering thousands\n          of questions regarding an \"accident\" when there has been another\n          \"accident\" that he is much more intrigued by and that she has kept\n          silent for fourteen years.)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          153.

Judit has the key in one hand and a huge\n          flower bouquet in the other. They greet each other enthusiastically.\n          Mateo-Harry attempts to hug her but his arms collide with the flowers.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Wait, my arms are full...\n\n           MATEO\n           Are those flowers?\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes! Happy Birthday!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          154. MATEO-HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo and Judit talk, they are sitting on a sofa, the conversation is\n          already mid-way.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Thank you for looking after Diego... I don't know how to thank\n           you!\n\n           MATEO\n           You've been looking after me for fourteen years now...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit brushes his acknowledgement off, with a half-smile.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           178\n\n          \n           I've found him somewhat hostile. He left without\n           telling me what it was that happened... Will you tell\n           me?\n\n           MATEO\n           I don't know. It should be your son to tell you.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit is upset by both of their evasiveness.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it that he\n           suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?\n\n           MATEO\n           (He evades the first question, but responds to the\n           second one.) Two weeks ago, at the place where he\n           D.J.'s, by mistake, he grabbed a friend's drink that\n           had been spiked with G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He\n           thought it was his drink, both drinks had Coca-cola.\n\n           JUDIT\n           Liquid ecstasy?\n\n           MATEO\n           Yes. It's a very dangerous drug when it's mixed with\n           alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres\n           before he drank from his friend's glass...\n\n           JUDIT\n           And... what happened... exactly?\n\n           MATEO\n           (Being vague.) He was badly affected. He spent two\n           days in urgent care, after that, I brought him here.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit looks at him, horrified. She can't seem to comprehend such a\n          turbulent and simple story.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           179\n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Diego's a drug addict?\n\n           MATEO\n           No. I've told you, he drank from the glass containing\n           liquid ecstasy by mistake...\n\n           JUDIT\n           But how can one make a mistake with something like\n           that?\n\n           MATEO\n           At first glace one cannot tell the difference. Both\n           glasses contained Coca-cola... It's not the first time\n           it happens...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit sighs, defenseless and horrified.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           Diego has not told you so that you wouldn't be alarmed...\n\n           JUDIT\n           (That I wouldn't be alarmed?!) Well, he hasn't\n           succeeded. At some point he will have to speak to me,\n           no?\n\n           MATEO\n           He is wanting to do so!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit takes a cigarette out of its box and lights it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Is that so?

He hands Mateo three DVDs (Scorsese's\n          \"Goodfellas\" (or the Coen Brother's \"Fargo\"), Tarantino's \"Kill Bill,\"\n          and Kiarostami's \"Taste of Cherry\").\n          Near them, on the bar table, two couples talk excitedly as if they\n          were about to go on a ride at an Amusement Park.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The barman tells them they may now enter.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          156. \"NO VIEWS\" RESTAURANT.

He tells them where to sit.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JAVIER\n           Imagine that your plate is the face of a watch. Your\n           silverware is at 9h and at 3h.

Two couples kissing, with bestial\n          enjoyment. And a well-bred woman performing fellatio on the man\n          sitting next to her.

She hides her nervousness in order not to ruin\n          Mateo's night, he seems fascinated with the place and completely\n          unaware of the process she is now living: the discovery of absolute\n          darkness. A bottomless pit.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JAVIER\n           Will the gentlemen be drinking something?\n\n           MATEO\n           Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The waiter leaves them.\n          Slowly, Judit begins to walk the plank that will plunge her into\n          anxiety. The evening feels far from a party, but she doesn't want to\n          spoil it for either Mateo or Diego. She hears Mateo explaining to\n\n          HIM:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           I found out about this place in the newspaper and I\n           wanted to check it out.\n\n           DIEGO\n           It's a German idea, there are various restaurant like\n           this one, they're totally in fashion.\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Can't believe what she's hearing.) Darkness, in\n           fashion? I don't understand.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Silence. Judit pours herself some water and drinks. And she gets\n          depressed, in silence.\n          She lights a cigarette.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           185\n\n          \n\n          158. \"NO VIEWS\" RESTAURANT.

(On the floor?)\n          To enliven the occasion, Diego proposes a toast.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Let's toast!\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes. Let's toast.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo pours the glasses. They each grab one. Clumsily, they bring\n          them close until they can her the sound of the crystal clinking.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Happy Birthday!\n\n           JUDIT\n           Happy Birthday! We must look into each other's eyes.\n           (She has already said it and it's too late when she\n           thinks of retracting it.)\n\n           DIEGO\n           Well, we're kind of screwed...\n\n           JUDIT\n           Oh, sorry... It slipped.\n\n          \n\n          \n          They attempt to clink glasses. It is not such an easy task. The\n          three glasses head for each other in the darkness, it would have been\n          easiest to have all three meet at the center, but instead each opts to\n          find the other. Only Mateo puts his forward and leaves it in place,\n          waiting for the other two to find his. When this happens, Judit's\n          glass collides with too much force, breaks his glass and wine spills\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           186\n\n          \n          all over the table cloth. Mateo attempts to make light of the\n          situation, as if nothing had happened. He presses his fingers into\n          the wine that has spilled on the tablecloth and exclaims:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           Joy! Joy! (to Judit) Bring your ear to me so that I\n           can sprinkle some wine behind it. It's for good luck!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit attempts to heed his request, she leans forward, offering her\n          head, parallel to the table. Mateo can't quite find her ear. Judit\n          collapses. Her head topples onto the table, without strength, and she\n          bursts into tears.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          159. \"THE MIRROR\" TERRACE.

The\n          sequence begins once all three of them (Judit, Diego and Harry) are\n          seated and drinking. Judit's emotional state has not improved. The\n          short sequence of events that she's had to live through since her\n          arrival have been making her increasingly tense and worried. She is\n          trying to combat the letdown by way of gin-and-tonic.\n\n          \n\n          \n          (They are sitting on one extreme of the ellipsis that makes up the\n          glass-enclosed terrace, decorated with cheesy Dec\u00f3 motifs).\n          At the center, where the bar is located, two or three waiters prepare\n          to clean up the tables. Once in a while, they look over at the only\n          three remaining clients. Once in a while, they are also able to catch\n          Judit's words.

Although on this\n          occasion, the setting is real and so is the drama.\n          Judit sips-down the gin-and-tonic quite rapidly. Mateo and Diego\n          accompany her.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          160. CONTINUED. MIRROR TERRACE. INT.

A plan had occurred to\n           him but, to carry it out, he had to bribe, at the very\n           least, both Luis and me. It wasn't an issue, we both\n           sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With\n           me, he had the courtesy to provide an alibi, he\n           proposed that I leave for a month and a half to the\n           United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could\n           undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I\n           wouldn't have to be present while he destroyed the\n           movie (because that was his plan, to make a mess out\n           of the film). I opted to stay in Madrid and have\n           Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness\n           everything. If I was going to betray you, I wanted to\n           pay the full price...\n\n           MATEO\n           What a living hell! For both of you!\n\n           DIEGO\n           You said it!\n\n          \n\n          \n          She takes a deep breath and continues:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select the worst\n           takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning\n           your film into a monster (briefly tears?). The only\n           way of withstanding that was to suffer more.\n\n           189\n\n          \n           (Overcome) I sold myself to Ernesto because of my pain\n           and jealousy. I couldn't take it and I couldn't (then)\n           forgive you for having abandoned Cinearte with Lena\n           without saying a word! My betrayal was my revenge\n           against you, against her and against myself... The only\n           innocent one was Diego... (To Diego) Forgive me, my\n           son, for the bitterness that you've had to absorb all\n           these years... no one deserves to grow up like this...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          161.

The waiter doesn't dare to tell her they've already\n          closed, so he serves her.\n          With the glass in her hand, Judit returns to the table where Mateo and\n          Diego wait, expectantly.\n          She has observed them whispering, but she hasn't heard what they have\n          said. She sits down with them.\n          Judit takes a sip.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           (Interrupts her) Don't continue, Judit!

We had no idea. Ernesto\n           Senior put everything together, the premier, all that\n           ruckus, to see if you'd react. His revenge was\n           pointless if neither of you found out about it.\n           (Pauses) Ernesto asked me constantly if I knew where\n           you were, but I said that I also didn't know anything,\n           which was true.\n\n           MATEO\n           (Somber) That's why I never called you, but even if\n           you don't believe it, I was very worried for you and\n           the boy.\n\n           JUDIT\n           I believe you...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego attempts to say that he, too, believes him, but Judit doesn't\n          give him time.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Ernesto hired various detectives to search for you, but\n           before they found you, you called me, two days after\n           the premier. (Slowly, debilitated.) I was too\n           embarrassed to answer, and... too stunned. I still am.\n           When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don't\n           know why, I gave him the phone number for Famara...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo and Diego listen to her, with renewed attention. This new\n          information reveals an unexpected possibility, something that neither\n          of the two men had considered. Their reaction toward Judit's painful\n          declaration changes in character. In Mateo's case, his compassion\n          vanishes and is replaced by doubt, now incited by new suspicions.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n\n           191\n\n          \n           Ernesto sent his son to find you in Lanzarote.\n\n          \n\n          \n          (Images of Ernesto Junior, inside a rented car, following the couple\n          across various places on the island, including the highway that leads\n          to Famara, on that last night.)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           He was the one who found you after the accident and\n           called the hospital...\n\n           DIEGO\n           Did he have something to do with the accident?\n\n           JUDIT\n           No! But I can't stop thinking that had I not given his\n           father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have\n           happened...\n\n           MATEO\n           (Dryly) Why do you think that?\n\n           JUDIT\n           I don't know...\n\n           MATEO\n           (Categorically) If you don't know, then stop torturing\n           yourself.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He says this with spite and somewhat disparagingly. For Judit it's\n          like a splash of cold water to the face.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The confession, rather than ending as a liberating catharsis, has\n          devolved in its opposite. The silence is weighed down by suspicion\n          and the new abyss between Mateo and Judit.\n          Never before has Judit felt Mateo this distant and antagonistic. Her\n          dramatic confession, far from liberating her, has opened new wounds\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           192\n\n          \n          and generated new suspicions. And Judit feels taken over by an arid\n          anxiety, corrosive, unbearable. She almost can't breathe.\n          Cut to.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          162. CASTELLANA STREET. EXT. NIGHT. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit, Mateo and Diego are inside Judit's car. Diego is driving. The\n          three are tense and silent.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          163. MATEO'S BUILDING. EXT. INT. NIGHT. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          In silence, they arrive at the entrance of the building where Mateo\n          lives. (Mateo is possibly carrying his umbrella or a blind man's\n          cane). He exits the car. Judit walks him to the front door. She is\n          glad that Mateo can't see her look of embarrassment.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           Good night.\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Destroyed) Good night. Call me if you need anything...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo doesn't respond. When the entrance door shuts like a resounding\n          \"no.\"\n          Judit waits until she sees him disappear into the elevator.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          164.

STREET. IN FRONT OF THE ENTRANCE TO MATEO'S BUILDING.\n\n          EXT. NIGHT. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Undone, and she no longer pretends otherwise, Judit returns to the\n          car.\n          Before she opens the door she bends over and retches violently.\n          Diego gets out of the car and holds her by the waist. He attempts to\n          help her.\n          Judit's face is contorted. She wipes a thread of saliva still hanging\n          from her lips. Despite the retching, she has not vomited anything\n          other than liquid.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           (Touching her forehead) You are sweating...\n\n           JUDIT\n           It's a panic attack... (Takes a deep breath, as if she\n           had lost her wind) Hand me the purse!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego finds the purse in the car and hands it to her immediately.\n          Judit searches through the purse, impatiently. She takes the purse\n          and drops all of its contents on the sidewalk. She find a box of\n          tranquilizers. The pill she presses through the aluminum seal comes\n          out with a pop; she places it on her tongue. She leans over the car.\n          Diego looks at her, scared, he has never seen her like this.\n          Articulating poorly, so as to not move her tongue, Judit say to him:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           194\n\n          \n           This will pass soon...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          166. JUDIT'S HOME. INT. NIGHT. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego hands her a glass of water. Once in bed, Judit takes two\n          sleeping pills. She has overcome the crisis.\n          Diego looks at her, very concerned. His mother has never shown\n          herself to be so physically fragile. He wants to help her, but it\n          doesn't seem like there is anything more he can do than what he\n          already has.\n          Judit attempts to smile in order to calm him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           I will sleep well with this...\n\n           DIEGO\n           Do you want me to stay here?\n\n           JUDIT\n           (Surprised) Here? What for?\n\n           DIEGO\n           In case the panic returns, so that you don't feel alone.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit eyes swell with tears.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           Thank you. I am feeling better... and I'll fall asleep\n           soon.\n\n           DIEGO\n           Call me, if you are not feeling well...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           195\n\n          \n          He kisses her twice and exits. The curtains that cover a large window\n          that looks out into an interior terrace are made from the same\n          material as those that Mateo has in his bedroom.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          168. HARRY'S HOME. INT. DAWN. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          The next day.\n          Standing over his desk, Mateo searches the desk drawer under the\n          computer. It's open. There are not many things inside (credit cards,\n          envelopes with money, a jump drive, the MP3, etc.), he goes through it\n          meticulously until he finds the note that Ray X had left him the day\n          he came to ask him if they could write a script together. Ray X has\n          hand-written his own telephone number on the note. He goes over it\n          with his fingertips, as if he could see through them.\n\n          \n\n          \n          He dials a familiar number, Diego's.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          169. JUDIT'S HOME. DIEGO'S BEDROOM. INT. DAWN. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego's mobile phone vibrates four or five times. But Diego is\n          sleeping and he doesn't wake up. The mobile phone stops vibrating.\n          In all the scenes where Mateo is alone at home, he never turns on the\n          light. He will be in the dark, lightly illuminated by any light that\n          the cracks in the windows let through.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          RETURN TO 168.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           196\n\n          \n          Mateo leaves him a message: \"I am sorry to call you so early. Tell\n          your mother to call me as soon as she can.\"\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          170. HARRY'S STREET. EXT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          As usual, Mateo buys his newspaper at the same news-agent. He turns\n          his body toward the Modeling Agency, but no one there enters or exits\n          whose odor or whose clacking heels rings familiar.\n          There are a few people on the sidewalk and those he crosses are all\n          heading, like zombies, to work.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          171. BAR ACROSS. 8 IN THE MORNING. EXT. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n          He enters the bar where his Waiter Friend works. The place has just\n          opened. There are very few clients.\n          He greets him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           WAITER FRIEND\n           Why here so early?\n\n           MATEO\n           I couldn't sleep. Would you mind dialing this number?\n\n          \n\n          \n          He hands him the phone and the piece of paper where Ray X's number is\n          written.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          172. KITCHEN, JUDIT'S HOME. INT. DAY. 2008.\n\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           197\n\n          \n          Diego is meticulously preparing breakfast for himself and Judit. He\n          works hard to ensure that they both start their day with the help of a\n          generous and varied breakfast, toast, juice, coffee and tea,\n          marmalade, toasted bread spread with oil and tomato, etc..\n          Judit appears through one of the kitchen doors, calm, with a look of\n          having rested (but also with the hangover of having survived a\n          nightmarish day, the day before). Diego does not hear her approach.\n          The mother takes advantage of this to observe her son with a tender\n          smile. When Diego turns to look, the tenderness disappears a little,\n          more out of modesty and a lack of habit. In any case, Judit enjoys\n          the peacefulness of the moment: her son caring for her after the\n          storm.\n          Judit looks over the culinary display.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           JUDIT\n           How impressive!\n\n           DIEGO\n           I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do the same\n           for Mateo...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Judit's expression changes, now a bit more somber.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           Are you OK?\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes, (still a bit beaten down) don't worry about last\n           night. It's horrible, but it only happens occasionally\n           and I know how to stop it...\n\n           DIEGO\n           It scared me, it seemed as though an alien would pop\n           out of your stomach.\n\n           JUDIT\n\n           198\n\n          \n           It's not a bad way of describing a panic attack...\n           (Changing the topic, one can tell she's made the\n           decision before she arrived in the kitchen). Diego,\n           there was one last thing I didn't tell you yesterday.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Assuming it will be painful, he attempts to dissuade her:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           About Mateo?\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes.\n\n           DIEGO\n           You can tell me some other time. Now it's time for breakfast.\n\n           JUDIT\n           If I don't tell you now, I may never do so... At the end\n           of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.\n\n           DIEGO\n           The year of punk.\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became involved...\n\n           DIEGO\n           In a love affair?\n\n           JUDIT\n           Yes... We were just getting started in film, and we are\n           still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his\n           side... That didn't keep us from working together...\n           until now...\n\n           DIEGO\n           I knew all that, or I imagined it...\n\n           JUDIT\n           There's one more thing... Mateo is your father...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           199\n\n          \n          Diego looks at her, astonished.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           And that fleeting lover, my supposed biological\n           father? You made him up?\n\n           JUDIT\n           No... I... can hide things... but I never make things up...\n           I don't know how to make up... The fleeting lover\n           existed, he was gay and our affair was short-lived.\n           His name was Vicente and it was while I was with him\n           that you were conceived, but your biological father\n           was Mateo, not Vicente.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Still thinking about what he has just heard, Diego places the\n          breakfast on the main kitchen table and serves his mother a cup of\n          tea. Judit begins to drink it, one tiny sip at a time.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           (Assimilates the news. He is not displeased) Does\n           Mateo know?\n\n           JUDIT\n           No. At that time, he asked me and I denied it, of\n           course. I didn't want to put pressure on him, I\n           didn't want our relationship to change because of it.\n           After all, I had never asked him if he wanted to\n           become a father.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The pieces begin to fall together.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           I see...\n\n           JUDIT\n\n           200\n\n          \n           If you think I made a mistake, don't tell me now. We\n           have the rest of our lives for recriminations.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Diego remains pensive for a moment.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           I will not recriminate you... I think I like being\n           Mateo's son (the son of a bitch) ... Speaking of, he\n           called early this morning...\n\n           JUDIT\n           Who?\n\n           DIEGO\n           Mateo.

I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just\n           found out the material was destroyed in '94.

In any case, sooner or later the lab disposes of\n           all the material... and that was many years ago.\n\n           MATEO\n           That's not anything that I don't already know.\n\n           JUDIT\n           As the film's producer I was the only one who had\n           access to the lab... to all the material. After I gave\n           the order to have everything destroyed, I intercepted\n           it. And I kept it.

They are then distracted by a noise\n          from the car that is about to hit them. These images have been\n          recorded from inside a different car, which has been following them\n          from behind, at a safe distance (Ernesto Junior's car).\n          Mateo reaches the living room from the other end of the house,\n          dripping with sweat.\n          Diego has just watched the kiss and the accident. He rewinds and he\n          pauses right at the moment when Mateo's and Lena's kiss fills the\n          whole screen.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           MATEO\n           Is there something new I should know about?\n\n           DIEGO\n           (Surprised and moved) It's a very interesting\n           documentary... And, yes, in effect, Ernesto followed\n           you to Lanzarote, until the last moment.\n\n           MATEO\n           The images are there?\n\n           DIEGO\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           206\n\n          \n           Yes.\n\n           MATEO\n           Those of the last night?\n\n          \n\n          \n          They take a look at the images that Ernesto taped at \"El Mirador\" from\n          the outside.

He recorded you at a safe distance, while you\n           were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit\n           by the light of his headlights. It's not a lot, but\n           enough to see what happened. Not only did he not have\n           anything to do with the accident, he saved your life.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo watches the screen of the television without being able to see\n          it, taking in the information Diego gives him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           DIEGO\n           And one more e thing: When you were at the traffic\n           circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and\n           Lena kiss...\n\n           MATEO\n           A kiss? I don't remember it...\n\n           DIEGO\n           It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the many\n           kisses a couple gives each other, almost without\n           thinking...\n\n           MATEO\n           (Pensive) The last kiss...\n\n           DIEGO\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           207\n\n          \n           Yes. Even if it sounds cheesy, someone has to tell\n           you: Lena did not die in your arms, as you dreamed,\n           but the last sensation she experienced in this world\n           was the taste of your mouth...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Mateo watches without seeing the television, he gets close to the\n          screen. With his fingertips, he caresses the surface, literally\n          touching Lena's last kiss.\n          Shots of Mateo's hand caressing the screen, with the image of the\n          kiss. Shot of Diego observing the entirety of the scene, moved. A\n          shot of everything. The appropriate kind of music accompanies the\n          scene as it begins to fade out, bit by bit, while a sign appears:\n\n          EPILOGUE.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          177.

An ashtray with a lit\n          cigarette. The hands of the editor powering the Avid, directing the\n          mouse through all the necessary steps until the screen fills with a\n          block of sequences of \"Girls and Suitcases,\" in Pina's loft.\n\n          \n\n          \n          The images fill the entire screen of the main narration. It begins\n          with the same sequence Diego and Mateo watched on television.\n          Everything is the same, but it plays completely differently. The\n          actresses are funny and fresh. The spectator does not know what the\n          difference is, but, unconsciously, he must feel enthralled by the\n          sequences of Pina and Chon, as if spellbound.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           208\n\n          \n\n          178.

Only the feelings are authentic and the\n          women's happy disposition for living in hysteria.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           CHON\n           (Struggling with what she's about to say.) Yes. I\n           was telling you that I also have a suitcase at home.\n\n           PINA\n           Your husband's?\n\n           CHON\n           No. It's a suitcase with fifteen kilos of cocaine,\n           uncut.\n\n          \n\n          \n          Pina's eyes open wide.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           PINA\n           You've become a dealer, Chon?\n\n           CHON\n           No! How could you think that! I am still a Counselor\n           for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase\n           appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the\n           police find out. They could put me in jail!\n\n           PINA\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           212\n\n          \n          Certainly!\n\n           CHON\n          I have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as soon as\n          possible. (Thinks.) Because of the hours we keep,\n          politicians consume a lot of drugs. So, between my\n          party cohorts and city hall, I could distribute two\n          kilos, but what do I do with the rest!\n\n           PINA\n          Throw it out!\n\n           CHON\n          Are you crazy? How could I throw it out?! I have to\n          keep the police from finding it in my house... I have\n          to take it some other place, immediately!\n\n           PINA\n          But I don't understand...\n\n           CHON\n          (Interrupts.) Well, it's clear, honey!\n\n           PINA\n          (Finishes her question.) How is it that the suitcase\n          appeared in your closet?\n\n           CHON\n          (Drinks a little coffee, and takes a bite from a\n          pastry.) As I was telling you, after breaking up with\n          my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who\n          kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung. Summing\n          up, I took him home and screwed him over and over...\n          (Takes another sip of coffee.)\n\n           PINA\n          An how was he?\n\n           CHON\n          In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I've got\n          goose-bumps! (She shows her the hair on her arm,\n\n           213\n\n          \n           standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who\n           knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure!\n\n           PINA\n           So you lost your mind...\n\n           CHON\n           What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could\n           stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I\n           couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking\n           that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the\n           suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the\n           closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase.\n           And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure\n           chance, I am watching TV last night and I find out\n           that the police have nabbed him in the course of a\n           drug sting operation and that he is one of the most\n           wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I\n           discover that it is filled with little bags of\n           cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't\n           returned since...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Pina breathes out in solidarity.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           PINA\n           What a story, my God!\n\n           CHON\n           (Concluding.) I was wondering why he was such a good\n           fuck! For men living in such high-stakes conditions,\n           each fuck could be the last! (She reaches her arm\n           out, again.) Look, the goose-bumps!\n\n          \n\n          \n          Once again, she shows Pina her arm, hair standing straight up.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           214\n\n          \n\n           PINA\n           I've seen them already... They comes easy for you...\n           (Changing topic.) And the suitcase?\n\n           CHON\n           (Humble.) I was going to ask you... if you didn't mind\n           that I brought it here. If they find it in my house,\n           well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that\n           it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of\n           Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would be,\n           and my party! My party can't take one more scandal!\n\n          \n\n          \n          The doorbell rings:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n           CHON\n           The police!\n\n           PINA\n           Shush, how could it be the police?! No one knows\n           you're here!\n\n           CHON\n           I am a woman who attracts attention, Pina. Since I\n           was a little girl...\n\n           PINA\n           Just pretend you're here for coffee...\n\n          \n\n          \n          Pina limps toward the door, uncertain. (Behind it she will find new\n          adventures). She looks back, toward Chon, half-smiling, tired but\n          charming, filled with understanding and a love for life, with all its\n          emotions and its contradictions. It's with this half-smile on\n          Magdalena's face that the sequence arrives at its end.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          181. AVID ROOM.
