Immediately following, the building goes\n          dark.\n\n          Establishing shot of the Eiffel Tower, lit. Suddenly, all the lights\n          go out.\n\n          The same thing happens with the Granada's Alhambra, Seville's Giralda\n          Tower, the Guggenheim at Bilbao, the Gate of Alcala. All these well-\n          known architectonic wonders turn dark, abruptly. (Beauty that\n          disappears suddenly, beauty that's extinguished and envelops us in\n          darkness.)\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          1. HARRY CAINE'S HOME. INT. NIGHT.\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Harry (fifty years old) sits, as if he were waiting, without hurry,\n          immobile and patient in his study next to his desk, as if it were the\n          thing keeping him company. He isn't doing anything. He lets time\n          take its course. His silence is broken by the sound of footsteps that\n          come and go. At first we can't see who the footsteps belong to, until\n          they stop.\n\n          In the living room, a few meters from Harry, Judit stops. She, too,\n          is shrouded in darkness. She looks at her wristwatch, the second hand\n          moves from left to right on the watch face. Judit (forty-eight, looks\n          younger) breathes, impatient. (She is dressed soberly, in a dignified\n          and practical manner).\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          She approaches a window that looks out onto the street. Everything\n          outside is also in darkness. The building in front is just a dark\n          mass. She looks to the end of the street. Almost all the buildings\n          visible from the window are dark, the Gate of Alcala in the background\n          is also not lit. Without turning, she says to Harry:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           The Door of Alcala has also darkened.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Harry is still sitting, inert, absorbed by his thoughts. The whole\n          house is in darkness, only the ambient clarity of the night comes\n          through the windows, curtains drawn back.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           3\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Judit heads slowly toward the kitchen. On the wall there is a Vitra\n          clock, to which she gives a cursory glance.\n          She turns on the faucet and fills a glass of water. From her pocket,\n          she removes a tiny heart made of black nacar shell and rimmed in\n          silver. She opens it. She grabs a small pink pill. She takes it.\n          She glances once more at the stylized design of the Vitra clock. The\n          minute hand nears 8 p.m.\n          On a windowsill (or on the kitchen table) there is an open newspaper.\n          The exposed page displays an article about the dangers of global\n          warming. An international date has been convened for a five minute\n          blackout at 8 p.m.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Standing in the kitchen, Judit, poised and tense, looks up at the spot\n          where the clock is. The stillness of all the elements comprising the\n          frame make it seem like a painting. She waits until the seconds hand\n          completes its cycle and it's 8 o'clock sharp.\n          Swiftly, Judit powers the central electrical switchboard, which is in\n          the kitchen. The kitchen lights up, the refrigerator emits its\n          characteristic sound. The lamps in the living room also light up.\n          (Low-hanging lamps that make the light bounce. The house is awash in\n          a special luminous atmosphere \u00ad dense, translucent, with darkened\n          zones). All the furniture is flush with the walls. There are some\n          paintings hanging and a rug on the ground, everything is of the kind\n          of quality that denotes good personal taste.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Upon the light's return, Judit exhales a profound sigh of relief.\n          She moves toward the window where she was standing earlier and\n          contemplates how, in the building across the way, the windows begin to\n          blink, in square patterns of light.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2. FLASHBACK. 1994. LANZAROTE HOSPITAL. INT. DAY.\n</b>\n\n<b>           4\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The light's return is contagious, a true spectacle, which ends with a\n          blinding light that floods the screen.\n          It will probably be a close-up of the sun.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          That very sun enters through another window, which is not that of\n          Harry's house, nor that of the building across the way. It is the\n          window of a hospital room (perhaps a sign should specify that the\n          following scene occurs \"Fourteen years earlier\")\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The hospital is on Lanzarote Island, in the Canary Islands. The scene\n          occurs fourteen years earlier. The characters are the same. Harry\n          and Judit.\n          Harry lies in bed, his head completely bandaged. Sunlight enters\n          through the window.\n          Judit is seated on the bed. She holds his hand and pleads, worried\n          and loving:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           Mateo, say something!\n\n<b>           MATEO-HARRY\n</b>           Mateo is dead.\n\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           (Sweet and devastated) Don't say that!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The character to whom Judit refers as Mateo, (the same one that in the\n          previous scene we have called Harry), has a recent wound, either on\n          his arm or on his hands, along with his head, which is completely\n          covered by bandages.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Mateo and Harry are the same person, the difference is the fourteen\n          years that separate them. Harry, in the present (2008), is fifty\n\n<b>           5\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          years old. In `94, the time period when the flashback takes place, he\n          was thirty-six. Let's say that when he was thirty-six, Harry was\n          called Mateo. The character has two names, which his own voice-off\n          explains, while we observe what his day-to-day consists of in 2008.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           OFF HARRY\n</b>           I always wanted to be another person, to be someone\n           beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn't\n           seem enough. Living a single life wasn't enough for\n           me. And half-joking, I came up with a pseudonym for\n           myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as fate would\n           have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him\n           author all the scripts and stories that I wrote. I\n           came up with a standard biography to fill the back\n           flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an\n           industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a\n           boxer, a waiter and an advertisement hand-double. A\n           self-made man, active and attractive like an English\n           spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years,\n           Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person,\n           me, but a time came when, all of a sudden, I couldn't\n           be anyone other than Harry Caine. I became my\n           pseudonym. (He applies lotion in front of the mirror,\n           we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled,\n           reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not\n           reflect him. Of his two identities he only has one\n           left). Just as I had planned, a heterodox writer and,\n           never better stated, a self-made man, one might even\n           say, \"self-written man\". There was only one detail I\n           had not foreseen, Harry would be a blind writer.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           6\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          3.

(All the closets have sliding doors)\n          In his bedroom, he opens the closet and looks for the clothes he will\n          wear. Despite the fact that he cannot see himself, he stands in front\n          of a mirror. He smiles, pleased with his appearance .\n          Everything in the house is rigorously ordered. All that Harry needs\n          to ascertain the identity of the things around him is his touch.\n          He exits onto the street.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          4.

When\n          he reaches the opposite sidewalk, the credits appear on the black and\n          white stripes that mark the crossing. The crossway is clear of\n          pedestrians so that only cars pass through (not many) and as they do,\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           7\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          they run over the letters of the credits, making them disappear, in\n          pieces. On a different stripe, a new title appears and as it does, it\n          is run over and destroyed by another car. Like this, successively.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          5. SIDEWALK ACROSS FROM HARRY'S BUILDING. EXT.

This is part of his daily\n          routine. He greets the attendant familiarly. He has the kind of face\n          that provokes pity. He grabs the newspaper, folds it, and places it\n          under his arm.\n          Cut to.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          6.

Just as\n          soon as he sees him, he is approached by his Waiter Friend, an\n          approachable guy, somewhere in his forties, who is helped by a South\n          American waitress, wearing her makeup since the early part of the\n          morning, whom he is obviously screwing. He brings him a coffee. All\n          of these actions are part of a daily ritual.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           WAITER FRIEND\n</b>           Do you want me to read you something from the\n           newspaper?\n\n<b>           HARRY\n</b>           No, thanks.

The camera swirls around his head. At first he hears\n          all the noises, indistinctly mixed, and then he begins to separate\n          them. He selects one he likes, the rest of the sounds of the street\n          disappear or their volume is lowered. Girls, cars, high heels, the\n          smells of different ethnicities. A multi-racial street. Harry\n          selects an odor (the body of a woman, whose aroma appears and\n          disappears), Harry follows it, having also singled out the sound of\n          her heels. He loses them. He finds them again.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          He walks self-assuredly, without tripping either on the urban\n          furniture or the people. He leans, lightly, on his umbrella, which he\n          uses as a cane. At first glance he doesn't appear blind ...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          He reaches a pedestrian crossing. Nearby, he recognizes the odor\n          which had attracted him, he follows its trace until he reaches the\n          sidewalk. The odor emanates from a young Girl, just next to him,\n          waiting before the crosswalk. Harry searches with the tip of the\n          umbrella, until he brushes her shoe. He excuses himself, as if the\n          contact had been inadvertent. The girl regards him. Harry then takes\n          one step forward, intent on crossing the street, the cars come very\n          close to him, almost running him over. (A real sense of danger). The\n          light is red for pedestrians.

He was born mentally\n           handicapped and Arthur Miller hid him; he doesn't even\n           mention him in his memoirs. He never recognized him\n           publicly. From the moment he was born, he had him\n           placed in an institution and wanted to hear nothing of\n           him. Despite his condition, the boy was able to learn\n           and to make an almost normal life for himself. He\n           lived in an apartment with other friends and he found\n           a job as a clerk in a supermarket...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Judit looks at him perplexed.

Among those\n           present was his mentally handicapped son, who was\n           integrally involved with organizations that aided all\n           sorts of disabled people. The son was very proud to\n           finally be sharing something with his father. At the\n           end of the conference, he approached the stage and\n           held him in an embrace that must have seemed endless\n           to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract\n           himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine,\n           it would not have been politically correct, least of\n           all given the situation in which Miller found himself.\n           Then the stranger let go of him and told him: \"I am\n\n<b>           18\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>           your son, Daniel, and I am very proud of you, Father!\"\n           This was the only time father and son saw each other.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Judith listens, affected and disoriented. She looks at her son as if\n          she were looking for help. Diego stops thumbing through a magazine in\n          order to listen to Harry and to witness his mother's reaction. She\n          wasn't ready for Harry to counter with such a shocking narrative.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           (Somewhat tense) It's very moving, but I don't think\n           we can write a script about Arthur Miller without\n           procuring rights from the family.\n\n<b>           HARRY\n</b>           We change the names, the story is not about the\n           writer's miserliness, but about the strength of the\n           son who survives without the least bit of rancor\n           toward the father who has ignored him his entire life.\n           It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent\n           goodness.

Diego keeps watching them. Her mother appears oddly cornered,\n          until she remembers a past comment of Harry's, that suits her just\n\n<b>          RIGHT:\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           It's a beautiful story.

Nor stories whose protagonists were film\n\n<b>           19\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>           directors, handicapped or blind.

Fairly close to the boss' office, divided by\n          modern and ample cubicles, we find some of the company's employees.\n          His secretary, Magdalena (her diminutive is Lena), is speaking on the\n          phone with a look of contained alarm. Personal problems.\n          In her early thirties, Lena is dressed soberly, almost excessively so\n          (as if she were attempting to project a maturity, effectiveness and\n          responsibility that she not yet possesses). She is a very beautiful\n          woman, on whose countenance the passing of time has begun to leave its\n          mark. She has a small mole, slightly raised, next to the seam of the\n          lips, and another one on the top edge of the nose. She could do more\n          with her physique, modernize it, but this is not what she aims for.\n          Her face reminds us of one of the heroines of the American film noir,\n          brought up to date. She possesses the turbulent and at once\n          translucent beauty of Gene Tierney and the bored disdain of Linda\n          Darnell (in \"Fallen Angels\"). Lena is a splendid fallen angel.\n          We can't hear what she says, but judging from her reaction, the\n          content of her conversation is dramatic. Her eyes flash with\n          indignation and anger.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          RETURN TO 19.\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           25\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Ernesto Martel calls Lena, his personal secretary, by way of an\n          internal line.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          RETURN TO 20.\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Magdalena interrupts her conversation with \"I'll call you later\", as\n          the indicator lights up, announcing another call on the line. She\n          pushes on the button corresponding to that phone call and she hears\n          her boss' voice summoning her. \"Yes, sir\", she responds, promptly.\n          She gets up from the table. She dries her eyes and nose with a\n          Kleenex, grabs a pen and a rectangular writing block and heads to\n          Ernesto Martel's office.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          21.

Lena arrives\n          inside a taxi to the entrance of Puerta de Hierro Hospital. On the\n          sidewalk, next to the entryway, her mother awaits, (chubby, tired,\n          defenseless and impatient, she's around sixty) next to her, a suitcase\n          and a huge plastic bag full of clothes. The mother is a small-town\n          woman, dignified and beaten.

Religious images on the nighstands. Attention\n          placed on the bedspread, the curtains, the dresser, the closet and the\n          walls. Everything is new, ugly period furniture.

The son is\n           sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations,\n           and lives under his shadow, trying to please the\n           father in everything. Despite being a bit...\n           homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the\n           father, and, just like him, he separates. He has a\n\n<b>           49\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>           son that hates him just as much as he hates his own\n           father.

There are vampires who occupy\n           important positions, keeping it a secret (like the\n           Opus Dei).

Once they are more comfortable\n           with each other, she wears a muzzle, as security for\n           both. Because when she's turned on, she has a type of\n           dental erection, her face grows into something like\n           that of a she-wolf...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Diego writes furiously, while cracking up.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           HARRY\n</b>           I like your story very much, Diego.\n\n<b>           DIEGO\n</b>           Our story.\n\n<b>           HARRY\n</b>           No. This one was your idea, and you'll author it.\n           I'll be your sparring partner, for all the times\n           you've done the same for me...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Harry is welcoming him as a writer.

The same\n          person accompanies him to the reception desk in the waiting-room area.\n          He is no longer the blind man who was walking euphorically along his\n          street's sidewalk, umbrella in hand.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           HARRY\n</b>           (Anxious) I am here to see Diego Garcia.

And perhaps a book.\n          Through the window you can see the day beginning to break, Diego\n          awakens. At first he doesn't know where he is. In the darkness of\n          the room he discovers Harry's figure, sitting on the wingback chair.\n          He can't tell if he's awake or asleep, but it soothes him to know he's\n          not alone.

He is sitting behind a table\n          filled with papers, photographs, books, magazines, an ashtray, pencil\n          and pen holders, etc. At its center, a script lies open, with tons of\n          notes scribbled on the margins of its pages. He is finishing the\n          definitive version of \"Girls and Suitcases\".\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The casual messiness of the place produces its own aesthetic. The\n          only decorations on the walls, here and there, not following any\n          particular symmetrical rule, are postcards of painters, actors or\n          landscapes, held in place by tacks. There is also a newspaper page\n          that has caught Mateo's attention. Or some astonishing photograph,\n          taken from a magazine. The cover of some magazine. Everything without\n          framing, tacked directly onto the wall.\n          The furniture is pastel, medium-shade green or red, with velvet\n          tapestry, worn and outmoded.

In the improvised waiting area (it is not a\n          proper waiting room but a transient-space turned waiting area by a\n          couch left over from the furnishings of some previous film). He finds\n          Ernesto Junior (in other words, the character who had introduced\n          himself as Ray X fourteen years ago; in his case, the age-difference\n          is noticeable, he's just a kid). He is a little heavier, his hair\n          longer, he reminds us of the love-struck big-kid that Phyllip Seymour\n          Hoffman played in \"Boogie Nights\".\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           78\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Mateo's gaze rests only for an instant on the young man, even though\n          the boy does not take his stupefied eyes away from Mateo throughout\n          the entire sequence.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Ernesto Junior has accompanied Lena. When he sees her, Mateo freezes,\n          at the door to his office.\n          Lena's back is turned, or her head is tilted as she reads a magazine.\n          Ernesto elbows her, Lena raises her head and discovers Mateo, watching\n          her from the door to his office.\n          Mateo's heart churns, it's a cinematographic churn, he feels like\n          James Stewart in \"Vertigo\", when he first sees Kim Novak at the\n          restaurant, with her famous green dress. Time stops for an instant so\n          that Mateo may contemplate this woman's apparition.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          After this brief hypnotic moment, they introduce themselves,\n          forgetting Ernesto's presence, who then, since no one pays attention\n          to him, introduces himself.\n          Even though she's a bit nervous, one can tell that Lena is a strong\n          and decisive woman. Brunette. Mysterious. Made-up in dark tones that\n          stand out on her pale skin. Refined. She doesn't have the aspect of a\n          comedienne, her presence is too intense, she seems better suited to be\n          the heroine of a film noir (as we've said).\n          Genres and their iconographies pose no limit on Mateo's capacity to be\n          attracted to her, from the first instant.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           LENA\n</b>           I am sorry we showed up like this, but I've heard you\n           are running auditions... and I would like for you to\n           give me a try out.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Mateo observes her intently.

She has also adopted the style of\n          Holy Golithly, her kind heart and that urbane sophistication that\n          characterizes modern girls from rural origins.

A tear drops from her face onto\n          the knife with which she's cutting the tomatoes. (In slow motion, one\n          sees the collision of the tear with the knife, in a cut-in).

There's no hurry, they pay careful attention\n          to all the details.\n          After the final sprint, they both come, satisfied.

On her knees, she\n          vomits into the toilet.\n          After she's done vomiting she gets up and looks at herself in the\n          mirror. She wipes off her mouth and closes the faucet. She looks\n          very pale, the exertion from the vomiting is written on her face.\n          Quickly, she puts some makeup on. Enough to bring some color back to\n          her cheeks and to get rid of the bags under her eyes. Her eyes still\n          glimmer from the tears she's shed. More than in any other sequence,\n          it is here that Lena reveals her talent as an actress.\n          She exits the bathroom, wrapped in an elegant robe, a bit divine-\n          hippie.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          73.

Lena\n          could take off running, but instead she stays right where she is; she\n          lets Ernesto bring her into focus and frame her correctly, while she\n          fixes her hair.

We discover this when he\n          is halfway into it; the images pick the action up at the point when\n          Lena exits Mateo's house and confronts the camera, right after she has\n          attempted to grab the camera away from Ernesto Junior.\n          The shots in 16mm alternate with the shots in 35mm that belong to the\n          main narrative. The sound is uproarious, we can hear what they say in\n          a low volume, just as reference. Ernesto asks for the sound to be\n          muted so that the \"translator\" can do her job.\n          The \"lip reader\" tries, as usual, to be \"neutral and inexpressive\",\n          but on this occasion she cannot help but have the violence of the\n          scene affect her. She acts as a mere vehicle, not part of the\n          conflict; nonetheless, she gets a little nervous. She is seated next\n          to the volcano: Ernesto Senior, stony, frozen, silent, and about to\n          explode.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          84.

At first, her voice\n          overlaps with that of the translator, who becomes instantly silent and\n          turns her head toward the door where Lena is standing.

During the time the fall takes, Ernesto doesn't move,\n          he watches her fall, bump by bump.

The sculpture turning around\n          itself produces a strange screeching sound.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           140\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          118.

Mateo's hair is longer and he appears more\n          tan, the proximity to nature and the absence of a social life has also\n          affected Magdalena's appearance, now much more savage, but also more\n          serene and more humble. She is dressed in cheap clothing, which she\n          has bought on the island (and which fits her marvelously) and her hair\n          is pulled up into a messy bun.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The photograph, enlarged, presides on top of a small table where Mateo\n          writes. The picture is leaning against the wall. It's the only image\n          inside the bungalow. The photograph is a clear metaphor for the\n          mysterious quality of the island as well as of the isolation of Mateo\n          and Lena and of their fusion.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          While Mateo writes, Lena cleans the dishes or she does the laundry in\n          the bathtub. The two wear T-shirts, comfortable and sporty clothes.\n          (On the tape-deck one hears La Lupe singing: ... \"porque hay un hombre\n          para cada mujer y una mujer para cada hombre, y nosotros somos,\n          nosotros somos... la pareja\" [because there is only one man for each\n          woman and only one woman for each man, and we are, and we are... the\n          couple]). Mateo and Magdalena, the couple.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          In the bungalow there isn't much furniture; there's a large couch on\n          which they can lie comfortably, a short table, along with the wooden\n          table on which Mateo writes. Some armchair and lamps. And a tape-\n          deck.\n          Cut to.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           141\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          119.

The married couple (in the midst of their\n          breakup), played by George Sanders and Ingrid Bergman, is on a tourist\n          trip in that area of Italy and they have gone to visit the excavation.\n          One of the technicians describes the delicate work that is involved in\n          excavating part of a city that had been buried, centuries ago, by the\n          lethal eruption of the Vesuvius.\n          At that moment, the men who are working on the excavation begin, bit\n          by bit, to uncover a couple, a man and a woman, sleeping in an\n          embrace, whom the eruption had taken unaware, leaving them preserved\n          in this position for centuries.\n          Ingrid Bergman cannot stand the sight of this couple calcined in an\n          eternal embrace. She compares it to her own marriage, destroyed by\n          their lack of communication and by the absence of generosity between\n          them. She walks away from the place, unable to contain her tears.\n          The scene affects Magdalena and Mateo as much as it had Ingrid\n          Bergman.\n          Mateo and Lena instinctively embrace each other, seeking refuge in\n          each other, their posture echoes that of the calcined couple.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Suddenly, Mateo breaks their embrace. He positions the camera on top\n          of the table where he writes, not far from where the image of the\n          other \"embrace\" sits. He points it toward the couch and he presses\n          the automatic button. And they take a picture together, locked in an\n          embrace.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           142\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          120. PUBLIC PARK. MADRID.

At that moment they are walking\n          facing the wind, a fierce wind that threatens to tear off their\n          clothes. It is as if nature itself wanted to keep Mateo from walking\n          away from the bungalow where he loved Lena. From this point on, his\n          life will become just that, an endless battle against the elements and\n          against the memory of Lena.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           160\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Little Diego's voice distracts him.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           DIEGUITO\n</b>           Look...

She enters into what had been Mateo and\n          Lena's love nest. She takes the entire space in with one glance; she\n          is overtaken, as if she has entered an ancestral and sacred space.\n          She imagines Mateo and Lena filling up the space with their presence.\n          (A strange modesty comes over her, but her curiosity is greater).\n          Lena's spirit (at least in Judit's mind) hangs in the air, but in the\n          material surrounding her absence is absolute. Those who took her body\n          did not leave any trace of Lena. Not a single object, not a single\n          dress. Nothing. Ernesto Senior's cohorts (or Ernesto himself) took\n          all of her things.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Mateo's clothes and things are found piled up in a closet. Yet the\n          table where he sat to write remains intact. On it, the photograph of\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           161\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          the embrace on Golfo Beach still rests, along with his notebook, blank\n          pages and some envelopes.\n          Judit observes the photograph on Golfo Beach as if it were alive,\n          still palpitating. And she imagines that the two lovers, locked in an\n          embrace, lost in the anonymous vastness of the black sand, are Mateo\n          and Lena.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          She opens the desk's drawer and, much to her surprise, finds it\n          overflowing with torn photographs of Mateo and Lena, shuffled in no\n          particular order (one might say they had been thrown violently into\n          the drawer. The violence of the hand that ripped and threw them has\n          left its pulsating mark).\n          Judit picks up all the pieces, slowly and delicately, and she places\n          them inside a brown envelope that she finds next to Mateo's notebook.\n          Her sense of guilt is so profound that it dries out her throat and the\n          expression on her face.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          139.

Judit places the bags with Mateo's\n          belongings, which she has just carried from the bungalow, inside the\n          trunk. She raises her head, emotionally exhausted. From where she\n          stands she can see little Diego, ecstatic, in front of a group of\n          surfers wearing brilliant colors traversing the waves and a group of\n          kites (around eight or ten) darting through the sky like flying fish.\n          Mateo is motionless, in front of the sea, soaking up its strength.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Judit's pain is at odds with the boy's joy and the overwhelming\n          vitality that the place exudes at that very moment.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           162\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          She begins to walk toward Mateo and little Diego. Once she is a few\n          meters away, she observes a surfer riding a wave. In the foreground\n          of her line of sight stands Mateo, out of focus. As he comes into\n          focus, Judit yells out to him:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           JUDIT\n</b>           Harry!

At this very moment she decides that she will\n          dedicate her life exclusively to the care of this man. This is how it\n          will be.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          140. HARRY'S HOME. INT.

The pieces begin to join with one another, an\n          order is established and, soon, the better part of the picture is\n          clear. There are four photographs where, regardless of the missing\n          pieces, one can make out the image. Two are of embraces and the rest\n          are of domestic scenes.

Pina, my God!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Throughout the conversation Pina makes coffee and prepares a tray of\n          Fornassetti cups and the whole bit.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           And that's not all!

I think I noticed it smoking a bit...\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           I dropped a lit match and it began to burn, and I\n           didn't want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will\n           have to change the mattress, but all for the best! A\n           whole lot of less memories!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Chon looks at her friend.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           But excuse me, I've interrupted you.

How could you think that! I am still a Counselor\n           for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase\n           appeared in my closet. Imagine the scandal if the\n           police find out.

(Thinks.) Because of the hours we keep,\n          politicians consume a lot of drugs. So, between my\n          party cohorts and city hall, I could distribute two\n          kilos, but what do I do with the rest!\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>          Throw it out!\n\n<b>           CHON\n</b>          Are you crazy?

Well, it's clear, honey!\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>          (Finishes her question.) How is it that the suitcase\n          appeared in your closet?\n\n<b>           CHON\n</b>          (Drinks a little coffee, and takes a bite from a\n          pastry.) As I was telling you, after breaking up with\n          my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who\n          kept watching at me, good-looking, well hung. Summing\n          up, I took him home and screwed him over and over...\n          (Takes another sip of coffee.)\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>          An how was he?\n\n<b>           CHON\n</b>          In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I've got\n          goose-bumps! (She shows her the hair on her arm,\n\n<b>           213\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>           standing straight up.) He's that kind of guy who\n           knows how to drive a woman mad with pleasure!\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           So you lost your mind...\n\n<b>           CHON\n</b>           What else could I do?! So he asked me if he could\n           stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I\n           couldn't promise anything. I didn't want him thinking\n           that I was that easy. So (breathes in) he brought the\n           suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the\n           closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase.\n           And, well, why would I care?! (breathes in) By pure\n           chance, I am watching TV last night and I find out\n           that the police have nabbed him in the course of a\n           drug sting operation and that he is one of the most\n           wanted traffickers! I open the suitcase and I\n           discover that it is filled with little bags of\n           cocaine. I ran out of the house and I haven't\n           returned since...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Pina breathes out in solidarity.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           What a story, my God!\n\n<b>           CHON\n</b>           (Concluding.)

Look, the goose-bumps!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          Once again, she shows Pina her arm, hair standing straight up.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           214\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           I've seen them already...

I was going to ask you... if you didn't mind\n           that I brought it here. If they find it in my house,\n           well, it's not about what could happen to me, but that\n           it's just not an ideal situation for the Counselor of\n           Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would be,\n           and my party! My party can't take one more scandal!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>          The doorbell rings:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           CHON\n</b>           The police!\n\n<b>           PINA\n</b>           Shush, how could it be the police?!

(Behind it she will find new\n          adventures). She looks back, toward Chon, half-smiling, tired but\n          charming, filled with understanding and a love for life, with all its\n          emotions and its contradictions.
