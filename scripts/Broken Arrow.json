It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.\n          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...\n\n          INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY\n\n          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are\n          lifting weights, shooting baskets.\n\n          IN THE RING\n          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out\n          of his head.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          You know what happened there?\n\n          HALE\n          Hell, I barely know what day it is.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          I set you up. I fake right, go\n          left three times in a row. You\n          expect it again, I take the right\n          in hard. That's what boxing's all\n          about. Make your opponent think\n          you're gonna do one thing, then do\n          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using\n          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.\n          (mimes rope-a-dope)\n          Everyone thought Ali's arms were\n          getting destroyed, when he was\n          really just letting Foreman tire\n          himself out. Eighth round, Ali\n          starts hitting, George's got\n          nothing left -- fight's over.\n\n          HALE\n          The fact that I can't feel the\n          left side of my face -- that's\n          okay, right?\n          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly\n          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.\n\n          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM\n          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught\n          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           2.\n\n          HALE\n          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he\n          doesn't. He drops his fist.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.\n\n          THE CROWD\n          Loves it.\n\n          HALE AND DEAKINS\n          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Don't watch my hands -- watch my\n          shoulders. That's where the punch\n          starts. Ready?\n          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.\n\n          THE SPECTATORS\n          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.\n\n          HALE AND DEAKINS\n\n          DEAKINS\n          You were looking at my hands.\n          Let's try it again. Ready?\n          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Come on. Focus. Ready?\n\n          (PUNCH)\n          My shoulders. Ready?\n          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It\n          connects.\n\n          HALE\n          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.\n\n          HALE\n          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           3.\n\n          HALE AND DEAKINS\n          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores\n          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out\n          of the ring between the ropes.\n          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his\n          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.\n\n          INT. SHOWERS\n\n          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.\n\n          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n\n          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,\n          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is\n          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting\n          down across the room from high windows.\n\n          HALE'S LOCKER\n          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures\n          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's\n          rendition of the Aurora, etc.\n\n          DEAKINS' LOCKER\n          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his\n          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.\n\n          HALE\n          Here.\n\n          HALE'S HAND\n          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          I can't take that.\n\n          HALE\n          Oh, shut up.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Really. I feel bad. How many times\n          have we fought and how many times\n          have you won?\n\n          HALE\n          Jerk.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Well, if you insist.\n          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           4.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          You know why I beat you?\n\n          HALE\n          Because you've been boxing for\n          twenty years and you're much\n          better at it than I am?\n\n          DEAKINS\n          You don't want it enough. You had\n          me today. I was back on my heels.\n          But you didn't close the door.\n\n          HALE\n          We were just sparring.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Life isn't sparring, Hale.\n\n          HALE\n          I think I saw that on a T-shirt.\n          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Here.\n\n          HALE\n          No, that's yours.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          If you weren't giving it\n          everything you've got, then I\n          don't want it.\n\n          HALE\n          No, I mean -- that's yours,\n          literally. I took it out of your\n          wallet when you were in the shower.\n          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.\n\n          EXT.

I mean, when that day\n          comes and we finally go to war\n          against Utah, we are really going\n          to kick ass.\n\n          CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT\n\n          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an\n          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the\n          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a\n          painting in progress.\n\n          A PARK RANGER TRUCK\n          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...\n\n          A RANGER\n          We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,\n          walks over and taps on the tent.\n\n          RANGER\n          Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to\n          somebody about this fire.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           7.\n          We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.\n\n          JIM (O.S.)\n          Wha--? Oh, hell.\n\n          WANDA (O.S.)\n          I'll talk to him, Jim.\n\n          JIM (O.S.)\n          Wanda, you stay put.\n          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.\n\n          JIM\n          I know -- no wood fires in the\n          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a\n          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.\n\n          RANGER\n          Sir, you see any other hikers,\n          campers anywhere around here?\n\n          JIM\n          Not this time of year. What's the\n          fine for something like this?\n\n          RANGER\n          Your life.\n          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,\n          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the\n          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him\n          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.\n\n          BAKER\n          Done.\n\n          HEADLIGHTS\n          Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of\n          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,\n          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to\n          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...\n\n          MR. PRITCHETT\n          A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He\n          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.\n\n          PRITCHETT\n          (to Baker, re: Jim in\n\n          FIRE)\n          Jesus.

The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.\n\n          TERRY\n          It was a copper mine, barely\n          squeaking along for years. They\n          shut it-down a few months ago when\n          they hit an underground river.\n          The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip\n          loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.\n          He motions for Terry to drive it in.\n\n          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE\n\n          Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses\n          a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A\n          gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.\n          Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-\n          mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the\n          Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.\n\n          HALE\n          They hardwired in their frequency.\n          We can't call out.\n\n          TERRY\n          What are we gonna do?\n          Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.\n\n          HALE\n          I'm gonna take away Deakins'\n          reason for being here.\n          Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a\n          panel on the side of one of the B-83s.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           47.\n\n          INSIDE PANEL\n          There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the\n          current time.

But it almost pisses him\n          off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself\n          and starts off down toward the raft.\n\n          TERRY\n          Sink it?\n\n          HALE\n          Steal it.\n          They get down to the raft.

He hops out and starts rummaging through it when\n          they hear grunting and feet approaching.\n          Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry\n          tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin\n          bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.\n\n          WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD\n          Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.\n\n          THEIR POV\n          Of the raft.

He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the\n          raft.\n\n          SHEPPARD (O.S.)\n          Why were you driving around with\n          a dead guy?\n\n          DEAKINS (O.S.)\n          Because I like him. He doesn't\n          ask a lot of annoying questions.\n          All right?\n          A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under\n          water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the\n          raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.\n\n          ON THE RAFT - MOVING\n          The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard\n          pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.\n\n          A TARP\n          Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.\n          It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Grabs the tarp and pulls.\n\n          UNDER THE TARP\n          There's no one there.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...\n\n          A LONG CRATE MARKED \"LIFE JACKETS\"\n          Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth\n          is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a\n          shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.\n\n          BACK ON THE RIVERBANK\n          Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite\n          what to do.\n\n          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT\n\n          The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call\n          them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins\n          walks with another man -- MAX, 50s.

Now, you can come with us,\n          or you can go with them.\n          Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing\n          in front of it are MPs.

You understand what\n          orders are, don't you, Major?\n          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing\n          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's\n          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.\n\n          WILKINS\n          Major, put that away or say\n          goodbye to your career and hello\n          to twenty years in Leavenworth.\n\n          HALE\n          If that's what it takes.\n\n          WILKINS\n          You'll have to shoot me.\n          Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that.

He jumps down\n          through the hatch as...\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Sees what's coming and jumps.\n\n          THE HELICOPTER\n          Hits...\n\n          THE POWER LIKES\n          Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.\n\n          THE HELICOPTER\n          Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.\n\n          EXT. CAR CARRIER\n\n          The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota\n          gas tank and...\n\n          THE TOYOTA\n          Explodes.\n\n          INT. NUKE BOXCAR\n\n          Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.\n\n          ECU NUKE TIMER\n          Five minutes and counting.\n\n          HALE\n          Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears\n          the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He\n          turns.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...\n\n          DEAKINS\n          They would've paid and I would've\n          stopped it. You've made a very,\n          very big mistake.\n\n          HALE\n          It's over, Deak. I beat you.\n          Disarm it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           93.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          If it's over and you beat me, you\n          disarm it.\n\n          HALE\n          Deak...\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Course you are going to need this.\n          (holds cell-phone\n\n          REMOTE)\n          All you have to do is get it.\n          (puts remote in\n\n          POCKET)\n          And if you do, as a special added\n          bonus, you get this.\n          Deakins pulls out...\n\n          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL\n          Then pockets it.\n\n          HALE AND DEAKINS\n          Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Ready?\n          Hale puts up his fists.\n\n          EXT. CAR CARRIER\n\n          It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the\n          one above it or next to it.\n\n          BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER\n          Terry is looking under the car carrier.\n\n          TERRY'S POV\n          The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat\n          from the flaming Toyotas.\n\n          INT. BOXCAR\n\n          Hale and Deakins circle each other.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Modern boxing is a pussy sport.\n          They want to make it about scoring\n          points. It's not about scoring\n          points! It's about this!\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           94.\n          Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the\n          chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In\n          the old fights, there'd be so much\n          blood, guys would slip and fall.\n          Let's see if we can't get a little\n          more of that red goo out of you.\n          Ready?\n          Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but\n          is sent back.\n\n          EXT. TRAIN\n\n\n          CU TRAIN AXLE\n          The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.\n\n          TERRY\n          Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the\n          axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears\n          a horn honking. She turns.\n\n          INT. BOXCAR\n\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Used to be, every fight was to a\n          knockout. You know what happens\n          when you get knocked out? It's\n          your brain slapping against the\n          inside of your skull. Here. I'll\n          let you see what it's like. Ready?\n          Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins\n          swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets\n          Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing\n          prone, seeing stars.\n\n          HALE\n          Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above\n          him. And then...\n\n          EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE\n\n          Snaps and...\n\n          THE TRAIN\n          Jumps the tracks.\n\n          INT. BOXCAR\n\n          Hale is thrown off his feet.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           95.\n\n          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON\n          Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.\n\n          THE STRAPS\n          Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.\n\n          EXT. TRAIN\n\n          The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,\n          steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.\n\n          FLAMING TOYOTAS\n          Fly, tumble, explode.\n\n          INT. BOXCAR\n\n          Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts\n          dropping below him as...\n\n          EXT. THE TRAIN\n\n\n          THE NUKE BOXCAR\n          Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.\n\n          THE TRAIN\n          The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.\n\n          INT. BOXCAR\n\n          Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the\n          slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...\n\n          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON\n          It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in\n          mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only\n          things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to\n          the bottom of the car.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the\n          nuke, not moving.\n\n          HALE\n          Looks around for something. He sees it --\n\n          DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE\n          On the floor.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           96.\n\n          DEAKINS' EYES\n          Flicker open. He sees...\n\n          A PISTOL\n          Lying a few feet away.\n\n          HALE\n\n          DEAKINS (O.S.)\n          You have to push amber, then red.\n          You might have time to push amber.\n          You won't get to red.\n          Hale turns to see...\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Pointing a gun at him.\n\n          HALE\n          The nuke is armed, Deak. If it\n          falls, the impact trigger will set\n          it off.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          I know.\n\n          HALE\n          Half a million people will die.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          (thinks, shrugs)\n          Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.\n\n          ONE OF THE STRAPS\n          Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.\n\n          HALE\n          His finger hovers over the amber button.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Do it and I shoot.\n          Hale looks at Deakins.\n\n          HALE\n          I guess you really don't know me\n          that well after all.\n          Hale presses the amber button.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           97.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Shoots.\n\n          HALE\n          Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.\n\n          THE REMOTE\n          Falls from his hand.\n\n          DEAKINS\n          Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...\n\n          THE LAST STRAP\n          Rips through and...\n\n          THE NUKE\n          Drops toward him, point first.\n\n          HALE'S BLOODY HAND\n          Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.\n\n          ECU NUKE TIMER\n          Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...\n\n          DEAKINS\n          His eyes fill with true terror as...\n\n          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON\n          Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.\n\n          HALE\n          Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,\n          opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.\n\n          HALE\n          Ready.\n          He heads out of the boxcar.\n\n          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS\n\n          Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the\n          train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n           98.\n\n          A TV NEWSVAN\n          Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.\n\n          HALE\n          Keeps running through the wreckage.

O.S. another vehicle drives up.\n\n          HALE\n          Come on! Oh, God.
