GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY\n</b>\n          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are\n          lifting weights, shooting baskets.\n\n<b>          IN THE RING\n</b>          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out\n          of his head.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          You know what happened there?\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          Hell, I barely know what day it is.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          I set you up. I fake right, go\n          left three times in a row. You\n          expect it again, I take the right\n          in hard. That's what boxing's all\n          about. Make your opponent think\n          you're gonna do one thing, then do\n          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using\n          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.\n          (mimes rope-a-dope)\n          Everyone thought Ali's arms were\n          getting destroyed, when he was\n          really just letting Foreman tire\n          himself out. Eighth round, Ali\n          starts hitting, George's got\n          nothing left -- fight's over.\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          The fact that I can't feel the\n          left side of my face -- that's\n          okay, right?\n          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly\n          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.\n\n<b>          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM\n</b>          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught\n          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           2.\n</b>\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he\n          doesn't. He drops his fist.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.\n\n<b>          THE CROWD\n</b>          Loves it.\n\n<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS\n</b>          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          Don't watch my hands -- watch my\n          shoulders. That's where the punch\n          starts. Ready?\n          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.\n\n<b>          THE SPECTATORS\n</b>          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.\n\n<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS\n</b>\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          You were looking at my hands.\n          Let's try it again. Ready?\n          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          Come on. Focus. Ready?\n\n<b>          (PUNCH)\n</b>          My shoulders. Ready?\n          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It\n          connects.\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>           3.\n</b>\n<b>          HALE AND DEAKINS\n</b>          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores\n          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out\n          of the ring between the ropes.\n          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his\n          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.\n\n<b>          INT. SHOWERS\n</b>\n          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.\n\n<b>          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,\n          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is\n          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting\n          down across the room from high windows.\n\n<b>          HALE'S LOCKER\n</b>          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures\n          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's\n          rendition of the Aurora, etc.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS' LOCKER\n</b>          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his\n          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          Here.\n\n<b>          HALE'S HAND\n</b>          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          I can't take that.\n\n<b>          HALE\n</b>          Oh, shut up.\n\n<b>          DEAKINS\n</b>          Really.

CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an\n          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the\n          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a\n          painting in progress.\n\n<b>          A PARK RANGER TRUCK\n</b>          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...\n\n<b>          A RANGER\n</b>          We don't see his face in the dark.
