(They chase after him, \n      He ducks into a bookstore and the boys run by. )\n\u00a0\nNEXT SCENE: \n      Coreander\u0092s Book store\n\u00a0\nBastian watches from inside the store as the \n      \nthree bullies go running by. He sighs felling \n      relief, \nbut is suddenly startled by a ruff bulldog \n      voice \nfrom somewhere in the \n      store.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nGet outta here. I don't like \n      kids.\n\u00a0\nBastian walks toward the area he heard to \n      \nvoice from, and finds an old man siting in \n      \na chair reading. He turns and looks at \n      him.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nYou still here boy? Didn't you hear what I \n      said?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nUm, I was.. (he stutters motioning to the \n      door.)\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nYou're hiding aren't you?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nNo I was just... (he stutters \n      more)\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nThe video arcade is down the street . Here we just sell small \n      rectangular objects that are called books. Require a little effort on your \n      part and make no b..b..b..beeps. On your way please\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nI KNOW books. I have 186 of them at \n      home!\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nBah. Comic books.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nNo. \n      I've read Treasure Island, Last of the Mohicans, Wizard of Oz, Lord of the \n      Rings, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Tarzan\u0085\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nWhoa whoa whoa. Who are you running away from? (he says with \n      new interest.)\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nJust some kids from \n      school.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nWhy ?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nThey wanna throw me in the \n      garbage.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nWhy don't you give them a good punch in the nose, eh?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nOh, I dunno.(he looks down at his \n      shoes)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe man turns away from \n      him again. Bastian looks at the book he has. His interest has been \n      aroused.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nWhat's that book about?\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nOh, this is something \n      special.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\n(Bastian moves in closer.) Well, what is it \n      ?\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nLook. You're books are safe. While you're reading them you \n      get to become Tarzan or Robinson Crusoe.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nBut that's what I like about \n      them.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nYes, but afterwards you get to be a little boy again.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nWhat do you mean?\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nListen (he motions for him to come \n      nearer.)\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nHave \n      you ever been Captain Nemo, trapped inside your submarine while the giant \n      squid was attacking you ?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nYes.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nWeren't you afraid you couldn't escape \n      ?\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nBut it's only a story.\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nThat's what I'm talking about. The ones you \n      read are safe.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nAnd that one isn't ?\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nDon't worry about it.\n\u00a0\nBastian:\nBut, \n      but you just said it was.... (the phone rings and Coreander puts the book \n      under a newspaper to try and hide it.)\n\u00a0\nCoreander:\nForget \n      about it. This book is not for you. (he gets up and gets the phone.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Bastian watches him. As he talks on \n      the phone Bastian uncovers the book. The title on the book reads, The \n      Neverending Story. above these words is a symbol on the cover. The symbol \n      is two snakes intertwined with each other and biting each other's tail. As \n      the old man hangs up the phone, Bastian grabs the book and runs out.
