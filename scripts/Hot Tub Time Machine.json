Son. The hot tub is the\n          whole thing!

Fine, we skip\n          that part and go right to the tub.\n          Trust me.

It's amazing.\n          Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three\n          guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,\n          splashing around.

Adam has to drink some tub water.\n          -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.\n          -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's\n          head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob\n          coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles\n          and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.\n          -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another\n          empty Red Bull his the patio.\n          -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC\n          TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.\n          -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM\n          across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.\n          -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3\n          BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.\n          -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very\n          dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.\n          -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the\n          backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More\n          Bacardi...

Have you ever\n          played this game before? It's\n          supposed to be awesome!\n          Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and\n          shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts\n          uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.\n\n                         LOU (CONT'D)\n          This is a horrible thing you're\n          doing and I hope you never have to\n          experience what I am currently\n          going through.\n          Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n          Your turn! Truth or dare?\n          Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:\n\n                         JACOB\n\n                         (SMILES)\n          Truth.\n          Lou throws up his hands in frustration.

Let me think.\n          I've never told anyone this, but I\n          was afraid of scary movies until I\n          was 18. I even ran out of the\n          theater a couple of times.\n\n                         SANDY\n          Oh you poor thing! Come here...\n          She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently.\n          Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.\n\n                         SANDY (CONT'D)\n\n                         (SHY)\n          I'm not sure I should tell mine.\n\n                         MICHELLE\n          Come on!

Let's hear it.\n\n                         SANDY\n          So this one time me and my friend\n          Lori took a train to Baltimore. It\n          was the summer and we wanted to\n          party, but we had no money. So\n          Lori found this businessman who was\n          also looking for a good time and\n          told him that we'd give him a half\n          and half for seventy-five dollars.\n          You know -- a suck and fuck.\n          Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT\n          storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.\n\n                         SANDY (CONT'D)\n          Anyway, we get him up to his room\n          and Lori starts going down on him,\n          but I really wasn't into it. So I\n          broke a piece of the bathroom\n          mirror and used it to cut his\n          artery on the-heck. Right here...\n          She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.\n\n                         SANDY (CONT'D)\n          He bled for about an hour before he\n          died.\n\n                         (MORE)\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          59.\n\n                         SANDY (CONT'D)\n          Afterwards, we took his wallet to\n          the bar and found out he only had\n          forty-seven dollars.\n          Michelle GIGGLES.\n\n                         SANDY (CONT'D)\n          Michelle!

To his LEFT --\n          Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and\n          earning accolades from all his new fans.\n          To Adam's RIGHT --\n          The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S\n          EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD\n          in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob.\n\n                         LOU\n          Fuck you, your turn.\n\n                         JACOB\n          That's the gay ear, you know.\n          As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --\n          He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE\n          TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then\n          he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before\n          getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.\n\n                         ADAM\n          So I lied to you earlier.

But I've never really\n          known you. I really wasn't\n          supposed to meet you again.\n\n                         JENNIE\n          Who are you?!\n          Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.\n\n                         ADAM\n          I came here from the future.\n          She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.\n\n                         JENNIE\n          Let me guess. You want to beam me\n          up to your spaceship built for two?\n          Or maybe you're wondering if these\n          are astronaut pants?\n\n                         ADAM\n          Astronaut pants?\n\n                         JENNIE\n          Because my ass is out of this\n          world? Give me a break, spaz.\n          I've heard them all.\n          She turns away. Adam goes after her.\n\n                         ADAM\n          No! No spaceship. No astronaut\n          pants. Just regular time travel.\n          With normal pants.\n\n                         JENNIE\n          OK, what's the punch line?\n          An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM.

Can\n          you breathe, partner? What's that?\n          I can't hear you. Just tell me you\n          can't breathe and I'll stop.\n          Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.\n\n                         BLAINE (CONT'D)\n          He's not saying anything. I guess\n          he can breathe.\n          Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.\n\n                         BLAINE (CONT'D)\n          Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!\n          Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She\n          goes down.
