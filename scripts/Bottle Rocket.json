There's just not time\n            for it.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Then you shouldn't of gone in\n            there, Dignan. Maybe we should of\n            robbed your house. Did you ever\n            think of that?\n\nDignan stops walking. Anthony looks back at him.

Just reach on in.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            That sets it off.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No, just do it real quick.\n                   (starts down the sidewalk)\n            I'll meet you down there.\n\nDignan cuts into an alley. Anthony turns back. Looks at a\nparked car. Looks left and right. Walks to the car and\nreaches in the half-open window.\n\nAn alarm goes off. Anthony unlocks the door and opens it.\nLeans inside. Grabs a wallet off the seat.\n\nA MAN standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of\nthe car. Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk\nnot too fast. He turns down an alley and runs.\n\nEXT. ALLEY. DAY\n\nAnthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a\ndumpster. The alarm is still ringing in the distance.\nAnthony starts looking through the wallet.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            It had an alarm.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Yeah, I heard that.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (counting the money)\n            Five, seven, eight dollars.\n\nHe looks at Dignan.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (taking the wallet)\n            Holy shit.

He hands\nAnthony a five dollar bill. Anthony looks at it. He takes it.\nHe puts it in his pocket. Dignan puts out his hand to shake.\nAnthony waits a second. He shakes Dignan's hand for just a\nsecond and walks down the alley. Dignan smiles and walks\nbehind him.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER PLACE.

Sure, I guess.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            You could make your own cinnamon\n            toast.\n\nBob looks at Anthony for a second. He looks at Dignan. Back\nat Anthony.\n\n                         BOB\n            Are you a fag?\n\n                         LITTLE RICHARD\n            You're the faggot.\n\nBob turns around to see LITTLE RICHARD, short but muscular,\nwearing a down vest and a baseball cap.\n\n                         BOB\n            Little Richard. I don't believe it.\n            They'll let anybody in this place.\n            Sit down.\n\nLittle Richard sits down.\n\n                         BOB\n            Dignan and Anthony, this is Little\n            Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.\n\n                         LITTLE RICHARD\n                   (smiling)\n            I don't know about that.\n\n                         BOB\n            Little Richard. Trust me. You're\n            insane. Jesus, this guy used to\n            carry a percussion bomb around in\n            his trunk. You do not want a guy\n            like that loose on the streets.\n\n                         LITTLE RICHARD\n            It seemed like a good idea at the\n            time.\n\n                         BOB\n            The one and only Little Richard.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Are you named after THE Little\n            Richard?\n\n                         LITTLE RICHARD\n                   (stares at Dignan)\n            Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it\n            up your ass. Great group of guys\n            you're hanging out with.\n\nLittle Richard goes out the door.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What was that all about?\n\n                         BOB\n            I can't believe you said that.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What did I say?\n\n                         BOB\n            I told you he's crazy.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            But he didn't say anything.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Hang on a second.\n\nDignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant. Anthony and\nBob look at each other. They start to get up.\n\nEXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT\n\nAnthony and Bob go out the door. Dignan is walking over to a\nstation wagon. Little Richard is getting in.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang\n            on. I didn't mean to --\n\nLittle Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then\ngets out fast and takes off his shirt. Dignan tries to hit\nhim but doesn't connect. They grab onto each other and start\nknocking around. Another GUY gets out of the station wagon.\nTwo more GUYS rush out the door of the burger place. Anthony\nand Bob stand back, nervous.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Let them fight.\n\n                         BOB\n            Let them fight.\n\nThey all watch. Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard,\nbut he's hanging onto him too tight. They keep spinning\naround together, moving down the sidewalk.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (calling out)\n            Anthony.\n\nAnthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            OK. Break it up. Break it up.\n\nLittle Richard lets go of Dignan. They separate.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I separated my shoulder.\n\nDignan is holding onto his arm. He kind of moans.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            OK. Hang on.\n\nAnthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm. Everybody's watching.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Just pull straight up.\nAnthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to\nyell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Is it back in?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (moving arm slowly)\n            Yeah.\n\n                         GUY #1\n            OK, man. Let's go.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No. I'm not fighting anymore.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            His shoulder went out, man. It's\n            over.\n\n                         GUY #2\n            You guys better get out of here.\n\nGuy #2 pushes Dignan. Anthony turns and pounds him in the\nface. Right on the nose. The guy goes crosseyed. He falls\ndown with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position.\n\nEveryone stands there stunned. Anthony takes a step back. He\nlooks up. He and Dignan take off. Bob stands there. Frozen.\nEveryone looks at him. Bob looks at Little Richard.\n\n                         LITTLE RICHARD\n            Bob?\n\nBob takes off.\n\nINT. CAR. DAY\n\nThe next day. They're driving with Bob. Dignan's up front.\nHe's banged-up from the fight.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            The guy is fucking insane.\n\n                         BOB\n            I warned you, Dignan.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You said it like it was a big joke,\n            Bob. Like he's wild.\n\n                         BOB\n            No, I was saying crazy like a\n            lunatic.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I know that now. He's a fucking\n            psycho.\n\n                         BOB\n            Well, don't blame me. I told you.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look\n            at her.\n\nThere's a beautiful GIRL on the sidewalk. They drive past her.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Loop around real fast.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Just turn right here.\n\nBob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again.\nThey don't say anything as they go past her. They all just\nlook at her. They drive on.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nA minute later. They've looped back. They're looking for the\ngirl.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where'd she go?\n\n                         BOB\n            Maybe she turned.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            There she is.\n\nShe's on a side street. Bob hits the brakes hard. The girl\nlooks back at them. They back up a few feet and turn down\nthe street. They drive slowly toward the girl.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Bob, don't be so obvious.\n\nThe girl keeps looking back at them.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I think we might of scared her.\n\n                         BOB\n            Let's just go.\n\nThey come up, beside the girl. She looks right at them,\nstill walking.\n\nHer expression is angry and also a little scared.\n\nThey drive away.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You blew it, Bob.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY\n\nAnthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is\nin his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless\nwide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the\nintricacies of firearms.\n\n                         TEMPLE\n            A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a\n            firearm. But anything you hold in\n            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A\n            wrench. A ballpoint pen.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            A ballpoiht pen?\n\n                         TEMPLE\n            Anyone who tells you a ballpoint\n            pen is not a weapon needs intensive\n            psychiatric treatment. You can\n            stick them in the esophagus. You\n            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.\n\nThey nod seriously. Temple laughs.\n\nEXT. FIELD. DAY\n\nThey're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an\nopen pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in\nmetal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper. Anthony\ndraws a man running on his target. They fire a bunch of\ndifferent pistols. The last one they shoot's a .44 Magnum.\nThey buy it.\n\nINT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY\n\nThe TV room. There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.\nThe doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the\ncoffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some\ndiagrams laid out. Anthony and Bob are on either side of him.\nDignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading\n\"Escape Route.\"\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            OK. Escape route. The most important\n            thing you can have is an escape\n            route. Just in case somebody's\n            tailing us. Or even chasing us, as\n            the case may be --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            You think we're going to be chased?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That's a good question. No. I don't.\n            I'm just being hypocritical here.\n            However, I will say --\n\nBob reaches for the .44.\n\n                         BOB\n                   (quietly)\n            I'm going to take a look at this.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (puts hand on gun)\n            Hang on This is important, Bob.\n            Anthony and I are responsible for\n            the internal situation. The money\n            and the people. You're responsible\n            for the external situation. The\n            streets and the getaway.\n\n                         BOB\n                   (nods)\n            That's my responsibility.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That's your domain.\n\n                         BOB\n            OK.\n\nAnthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Now. One thing we need to discuss\n            is timing. Timing is absolutely\n            crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (looks up)\n            Nothing.

He clicks the action.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Anthony, give me the fucking gun!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (pulling away)\n            No, Dignan.

You're right.\n\nDignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers\nagain. Freezes. Looks at Bob. Bob's looking at the gun. Bob\nlooks at Dignan. Bob looks away. Nobody moves.\n\nEXT. DECK. EVENING\n\nAnthony and Dignan have moved outside to the hot tub.\nAnthony pets Bob's dog HECTOR. Bob's brother FUTURE MAN\nwalks up the path from the driveway with his blonde\ncheerleader GIRLFRIEND.\n\n                         FUTURE MAN\n            What are you guys doing?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Nothing. We're just --\n\n                         FUTURE MAN\n            You seen my brother?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            He's inside.\n\nFuture Man goes inside. His girlfriend stands there on the\ndeck.\n\n                         GIRLFRIEND\n                   (smiles)\n            Hi.\n\n                         ANTHONY & DIGNAN\n            Hi.\n\nShe stands there, looking across the yard. Anthony and\nDignan sit there in the hot tub, looking around. We hear\nFuture Man's loud voice inside:\n\n                         FUTURE MAN\n            Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit\n            together.\n\nFuture Man comes back out.

Anthony and Dignan watch them walk\naway. Bob comes back out with some drinks. He looks shaken.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What'd Future Man want?\n\nBob shrugs and gets in the hot tub. They sip on their drinks.\nBob's got a Heineken.\n\n                         BOB\n            He doesn't get it. Held never\n            understand what we're trying to\n            accomplish here. It's too dangerous\n            for him.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Well, in reality it's not that\n            dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous\n            if you don't know what you're doing.\n\n                         BOB\n            Yeah, but what if some nut pulled\n            gun on you?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            The only nut with a gun is going to\n            be Dignan.\n\nAnthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (whispering, very serious)\n            You know, Bob, Anthony did kill\n            someone. He electrocuted our\n            janitor senior year.\n\n                         BOB\n            He electrocuted someone?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            It was an accidental. I don't want\n            to go into the details. It was just\n            one of those senior pranks that\n            didn't really go right. I mean,\n            obviously, since Swifty's dead.\n            That's why Anthony never graduated.\n\n                         BOB\n            His name was Swifty?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Yeah. One of the nicest old guys\n            you'd ever know.\n\n                         BOB\n            That's too bad.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (nods)\n            You know, when somebody gets\n            electrocuted, their skin starts\n            smoking. At least Swifty's did.\n\nINT. CAR. NIGHT\n\nAnthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in\nthe dark. Bob's at the wheel. Anthony and Dignan are in the\nback. Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap. Dignan's wearing a\nbaseball cap with the brim pulled down low. He puts a piece\nof adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to\nAnthony.\n\n                         BOB\n            What are you doing?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I'm putting a piece of tape on my\n            nose.\n\nAnthony tapes his nose. They stare out the windshield. The\nalarm on Dignan's digital watch goes off.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (immediately, dead serious)\n            Let's get lucky.\n\nEXT/INT. BOOKSTORE. NIGHT\n\nAnthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a\nhuge bookstore. The lights are on inside. They watch for a\nminute and then go to the front door. Dignan hides behind a\npost. Anthony knocks on the glass. An EMPLOYEE appears.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I left my sweater inside.\n\nThe employee shakes his head. He can't hear through the glass.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Do you have a lost and found?\n\nThe employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch.\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            We're closed.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I left my sweater in there.\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            Oh.

Dignan comes out from behind the post.\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            We're closed, sir.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where's that guy going?\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            He left his sweater.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Well, I left some money in there.\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            Where?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (pulls out the gun)\n            In the cash relister. Step away\n            from the door.\n\nDignan goes in. They walk through the store.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Where's the manager?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where's the other stocker?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            There's another stocker, right?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We know there's another stocker.\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            Rob?\n\nDignan points the gun at the employee.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where is he? Where is Rob?\n\n                         EMPLOYEE\n            I don't know. Maybe in literature.\n            That's his section.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You got that?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Sure. Literature. The classics.\n\nThe MANAGER is locking the door of his office.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Is that the manager?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (to manager)\n            Unlock that door.\n                   (to Anthony)\n            Check the aisles.\n\nAnthony starts walking through the store, checking down each\naisle. He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany\nand takes it with him. He goes through literature and sees\nROB in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a\ncarton of books beside him.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Rob?\n\n                         ROB\n                   (looks up, a little puzzled)\n            Uh-huh?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Why aren't you in literature?\n\n                         ROB\n                   (hesitates)\n            It's all full up.\n\nDignan is in the office with the manager and the first\nemployee. He's pointing at a drawer.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Open it up.\n\nThe manager opens it. It's full of office supplies.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            OK. Open the other. Let's go.\n\nThe manager opens the other drawer. It's full of cash.\nDignan looks at the manager. He looks back at the cash.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Put it in one of those.\n\nDignan points at some bookstore bags. The manager picks up a\nlittle one and starts to put the money in it.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            A bigger one, you idiot.\n\n                         MANAGER\n                   (glares at Dignan)\n            Don't call me an idiot, you punk.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nAnthony waiting outside the office door. Rob, the first\nemployee, and the manager are sitting against the wall in\nthe office. The manager's got an intense, angry look on his\nface, staring at Dignan. Dignan hands Anthony five little\nbags full of money and starts to close the office door.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.\n\nDignan closes the door.\n\nINT. CAR. NIGHT\n\nAnthony and Dignan jump into the car.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Go. Go. Drive slow.\n\nBob drives. Pretty slow. Anthony and Dignan keep looking\nback out the rear window. They're nervous. Nobody says\nanything for a block or two.\n\n                         BOB\n            What happened?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Shhh. Slow down, Bob.

Keep it at forty.\n\n                         BOB\n            Did we get it?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Be cool, Bob. Be cool.\n                   (quickly)\n            Make that light.\n\nThey keep driving. Breathing hard.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Holy shit.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We got it. We got it.\n\n                         BOB\n            How much is there?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Don't count it.\n\nEXT. HAMBURGER PLACE.

Dignan is\nstanding up with his drink in his hand.\n\n                         BOB\n            Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a\n            bag!\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No. I was calm.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What about what that guy said?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Oh, shit. That was scary. In the\n            middle of the robbery. The manager\n            looks at me. Right in the eye. And\n            goes, I'm going to remember you.\n\n                         BOB\n            Are you serious?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Yeah. He said that.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I swear to God. In a very quiet\n            voice.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Like he meant it.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Yeah.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Like he would find Dignan. One day.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Like I'm going to hunt you down and\n            kill you.\n\nDignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in. Then he\nfinally sits down and they all eat their burgers.\n\n                         BOB\n            You really think he'll remember you?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (smiles)\n            No. All he'll remember is a guy\n            with a piece of tape on his nose.\n\nThey laugh smugly.\n\nEXT. 7-11. NIGHT\n\nAnthony, Dignan, and Bob come out of a 7-11. Bob's got a\nslurpee.

Bob's not smiling.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That was really good driving.\n            Seriously. I mean it.\n\nBob nods and starts walking away, down the sidewalk.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We'll see you later, Bob. Good\n            driving.\n\nAnthony and Dignan sit on the curb. Anthony's drinking a\nmilk. Dignan's still watching Bob walk alone down the\nsidewalk.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What's wrong with him?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What do you think?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Anthony, he sat in the car and\n            watched a 4-11 in progress. He got\n            what he deserved.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            He was the driver, Dignan. He did\n            what he's supposed to do.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I didn't realize you were so\n            sensitive to Bob's feelings.\n            Considering I did the plans, you're\n            actually lucky you got --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Don't even say it, man.\n\nINT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY\n\nDignan and Anthony are following Bob through his house.

They're walking through the\nkitchen.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Look, I admit I was wrong for not\n            telling you before the robbery that\n            your share wouldn't be as equal as\n            ours. But the fact remains me and\n            Anthony were much more exposed to\n            danger.\n\nBob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector\nsits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks at\nHector.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You\n            didn't have some vicious lunatic\n            screaming, \"I'm going to remember\n            you!\"\n\n                         BOB\n                   (smiles slightly,\n                   keeps playing)\n            That's true. That would give me\n            nightmares.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Bob, I've got nightmares.\n\nBob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.\n\n                         BOB\n            You'll probably have them the rest\n            of your life.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What was that?\n\nAnthony opens the door to the patio.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What?\n\nThey hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony\nonto the patio. A voice yells out.\n\n                         VOICE\n            Motherfucker!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What's going on?\n\nBob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see\nwhat's happening.\n\nEXT. BOB'S HOUSE. EVENING\n\nAnthony, Dignan, and Bob go around to the front. Bob's\nneighbor PHIL runs down the driveway with a wrench in his\nhand. Phil is short and heavy, wearing a golf shirt.

He attacked me.\n\n                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND\n            He took two hundred dollars.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (to Phil)\n            Tilt your head back.\n\nLater. It's dark out now. There's a police car parked across\nthe street and another pulling over, lights rolling. One of\nthe OFFICERS walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in\nthe bushes. Dignan is talking with one of the other officers.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            He was probably on drugs.\n\n                         OFFICER\n            They usually are.\n\nTwo other cops are getting a statement from Phil. Anthony\nand Bob are listening. Some neighbors are milling around\ntalking.\n\n                         PHIL\n            As soon as I opened the door I saw\n            him. A black guy. Looking through\n            my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap\n            this guy.

Anthony and\nBob take off as Dignan runs by.

BOB'S CAR. DAY\n\nBob's at the wheel, Dignan in front, Anthony in the back.\nThey're driving fast down the interstate, past fields and\nfarmhouses.

This is\n            an emergency. It's only fair that...\n\nAnthony gets in the car. Pause. Dignan reaches into his\npocket and takes out a wad of cash. He counts some. Stands\nthere a minute.

Dignan lights an M-80\nand throws it out of the car.\n\nEXT. LAKE. DAY\n\nThey drive to a big lake. A dog splashes in and swims for a\ntennis ball. Anthony does some nice dives.

All right?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Now that makes sense. We'll hang\n            out for a couple of days. Get a\n            little R&R. Make sure Future Man's\n            OK and then get back on the road.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            As long as he gets out OK.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Obviously.

Bob looks at Dignan. Looks at Anthony.\n\n                         BOB\n                   (shrugs)\n            Yeah. I guess so.\n\nThey shake hands and start back to the room.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            See, now we've got a plan.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Don't worry about it, Bob.\n\nINT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT\n\nAnthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded\naround the little table by the window in the motel room.\nThey've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine.

NIGHT\n\nDignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita.\nEveryone's got their hands ready as  Carmen turns one card\nthen the next. Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish\nwith them about Las Vegas. He's talking about the rules at\ndifferent casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn.\nDignan's paying close attention to the deck. A jack comes up\nand he slams it.\n\nEXT. MOTEL POOL. NIGHT\n\nThere's a light in the pool. Anthony and Inez are swimming.\nAnthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water.\nHe goes under and comes up grabbing onto her. She laughs.\n\n                         INEZ\n            Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (passionate)\n            God, yes. Like silk.\nInez starts to giggle.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What?\n                   (starts laughing)\n            What?\n\n                         INEZ\n            Like silk?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            God. That does sound corny.  Oh,\n            your skin feels so soft and silky.\n            But it really kind of does.\n\nHe kisses her.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your\n            own risk.\n\nThey look up. Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool.\nHe smiles.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You know, I did save Anthony from\n            drowning once, Inez. Tell her,\n            Anthony.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nDignan sitting with his feet in the pool. Anthony and Inez\nare sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            See, one day we were playing hot\n            box over at my next door neighbor\n            Mr. Langston's house and Anthony\n            fell in the pool and got knocked\n            unconscious. I had to dive in and\n            save him.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            This was in fourth grade.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Mr. Langston performed\n            cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.\n            I've never said this before, but\n            frankly I thought Anthony was dead.\n            The veins in his face were all\n            sticking out. His skin was blue. He\n            truly did look dead.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            After that my parents never let me\n            go to Dignan's again.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            They blamed my family for everything.\n            They always said Mr. Langston saved\n            Anthony's life.\n\nDignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at\nhim for a minute.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            But if it wasn't for Dignan I\n            probably would of died.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (nodding, whisper voice)\n            Yes...It's true.\n\nThey're all quiet for a minute. Inez hangs onto the side.\n\nINT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT\n\nBob's sitting in the room by himself, close to the TV,\nwatching a war movie.\n\nEXT. MOTEL. DAY\n\nThe next morning. Dignan bursts out the door of the motel\nroom. He runs across the parking lot.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Son of a bitch.\n\nDignan runs back into the room. He comes out with Anthony.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            He's gone. He stole the car.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Where was it parked?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Right here.\n\nAnthony looks around the parking lot.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That coward. Son of a bitch.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Maybe he just went to the store.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            He took his stuff. He's gone.\n                   (pause)\n            I should of seen this. I should of\n            expected it. Bob doesn't have any\n            character.\n\nAnthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the\nhighway.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            He went back for his brother.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We said 48 hours.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            That's a long time to be in jail.\n\nThey stand there in the empty parking lot. Anthony goes\ninside.\n\nINT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY\n\nIn the room. The blinds are pulled. Anthony's sitting at the\nend of a bed. Dignan's pacing around the room.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We'll get him. Don't worry about\n            that. We'll go back. We'll find him.\n            And we'll blow up his car. Or do\n            something. I promise you.\n\nAnthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door.\nDignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead\n            weight. We're a lot better off\n            without him.\n                   (pause)\n            But who could expect it? Just like\n            that. Steals the fucking car. What\n            kind of person pulls that --\n\nAnthony opens the door and walks out.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Bob didn't steal the car. He told\n            me he was going. He had to go help\n            his brother.\n\nAnthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            When'd he tell you?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            This morning.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where was I?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            You were asleep.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            He told you and you let him do it.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            He told me because he wanted to\n            know if I wanted to go.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (hesitates)\n            If you wanted to go? What were you\n            going to do? Just leave me here by\n            myself?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Well, I didn't do it, did I?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            So when you were saying Bob's at\n            the store and acting real suprised,\n            that was just an act. You were\n            just --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Bob went to help his brother. I\n            understand that and I can't help it\n            if you don't.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I understand that if I had a few\n            more friends like you and Bob I'd\n            be dead.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            If you say so.\n\nINT. DINER. DAY\n\nAnthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a\nroadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            If you'd gone with Bob you'd\n            probably be in Weatherford by now.\n            Of course I'd be here frantically\n            worrying thinking you must of got\n            kidnapped.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I didn't realize you had such an\n            incredible ability to feel sorry\n            for yourself, Dignan.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Well, the world is a little bit\n            colder today.\n\nAnthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.\nThen he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two\ndifferent colors of felt tip pens.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            You want to look at the map?\n\nPause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning\nforward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction.\nDignan leans forward, looking.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            See. Here's where we are.\n\nThey look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the\nwindow.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I didn't know he had it in him.\n                   (pause)\n            I guess you could say the child has\n            become the father of the man.\n\nEXT/INT. MOTEL/TOWN. DAY\n\nAnthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and\ngoes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket\nas he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks\nover to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the\nbed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt.\nShe's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons\nher dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in\nthe air.\n\nThen we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's\ngot one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got\nhers around his waist. They're talking while they walk,\ngoing past people in the town.\n\nThey watch each other walking reflected in a window.\n\nEXT. MOTEL. EVENING\n\nDignan is doing the butterfly in the pool. Anthony and Inez\nwalk over and wait for him at the end of the pool.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            We're going over to this bar if you\n            feel like going.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you\n            later.\n\nDignan treads water.

MEXICAN BAR. NIGHT\n\nAnthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and\nsalt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony\nand Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping\ntheir feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar\nand he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they\nwhisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves\nover to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm\naround Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words.\nSo's Dignan.\n\n                         MAN\n            Hello, my friend.

The only thing I feel\n            like is getting the fuck out of\n            this place.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (pause)\n            We need a car.\n\nFor the first time Dignan looks away from the TV, at Anthony.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I have an idea for that.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Inez has a master key to all these\n            rooms, doesn't she?\n                   (pause)\n            Doesn't she?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I don't think we can do that.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I know we can. It's real simple. We\n            go into a room, grab some car keys\n            and --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What I'm saying is she wouldn't go\n            for that.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            She doesn't need to know.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (pause)\n            I don't know, Dignan. I just --\n                         DIGNAN\n            Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out\n            of here. It's real torture for me\n            to be here. Getting the shit kicked\n            out of me by Mexicans.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Shh.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            No one to back me up. Now I have a\n            good idea. So unless you come up\n            with something better --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Dignan. I can't do that. All right?\n            I just can't.\n\nThe bathroom door opens.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Then you better think of something.\n\nInez comes back in.\n\n                         INEZ\n            How are you, Jerry?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (staring at TV)\n            I feel great, Inez.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (kisses her)\n            I'll see you later.\n\nInez goes outside. She closes the door.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I don't think we need any keys,\n            Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car\n            for us.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You don't know how to hotwire.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Yes, I do. Bob taught me.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Bob taught you how to get\n            electrocuted.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            No, I'm serious. He made me a\n            diagram.\n\nEXT. SIDEWALK. DAY\n\nDignan's standing on a corner alone. He looks sullen.\n\nEXT. SIDEWALK. DAY\n\nAnthony walks down an alley. He goes past a beat-up\nconvertible. He stops, hands in his pockets. He looks both\nways.\n\nHe cuts back to the car, opens the door, and slips inside.\n\nINT. STOLEN CAR. DAY\n\nAnthony's behind the wheel. He hand signals a turn and pulls\nup next to Dignan. Dignan shakes his head as he looks at the\ncar. He gets in. They drive through the town. The wind's\nblowing hard. Anthony smiles at Dignan. Dignan tries not to\nsmile.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nDignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running. In\nthe side mirror he's watching Anthony and Inez. Anthony's\nsaying goodbye. He walks back to the car and gets in. He\nputs it in gear and they drive off.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What'd you say to Inez?\n\nAnthony shrugs.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            \"I'll come back for you. I love\n            you, Inez.\"\n\nAnthony is silent.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            \"I'm going to take you away from\n            all this windexing and making beds.\"\n\nSilence. Dignan exhales and looks out the window.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY. DAY\n\nThe car is on the shoulder, raised up on a Jack with the\nhood open. Anthony's looking underneath the car. Dignan's\nstanding in the middle the road with his hands in his\npockets. No cars in sight.\n\nAnthony starts messing around under the hood. He tests some\nwires and connections. He steps away from the car.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Man, I don't know anything about\n            cars.\n\nDignan stares down the road.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You really know how to pick them.\n\nAnthony walks over to Dignan. He stands beside him for a\nminute.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I think we better go home.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Don't panic, Anthony.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I'm not. But there's --\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You can't just run home every time\n            things get tough. First of all,\n            we've got enough dough to --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Our money situation is not good.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n                   (clapping him on the back)\n            You're so spoiled. What is \"not\n            good\" to you? Only a few hundred --\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            We've got sixteen dollars.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That's not correct.\n\nDignan stares at Anthony.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Give it to me.\n\nPause. Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the\nmoney. Dignan takes it. He counts it. He looks at Anthony.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Sixteen dollars.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I know.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Where's the rest?\n\nDignan stares at Anthony. Pause.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I had to give some to Inez.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            How much?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            $383.\n\nDignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What!\n\nPause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as\nhe can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and\ngrabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock\nthrough the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony.\nHe walks back over to him, yelling.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You gave $383 to the goddamn\n            housekeeper! What the fuck is your\n            problem?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            She needed it.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Her name's Inez. Stop calling her\n            the housekeeper.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That's what she is!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I know that. But --\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            You're in love with the fucking\n            housekeeper!\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Shut up!\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What are you going to do, get\n            married? Have a bunch of little\n            idiot janitor brats!

Follows it up with one\nafter another. Anthony ducks and puts his arms out. He falls\non one knee. Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car.\n\nAnthony stands up. He's got a bloody nose. He stares at\nDignan. Not angry. Just weary.\n\nDignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car. He shuts the\ndoor and walks down the highway.\n\nAnthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack. He\npulls it tight around his shoulders. He looks down the\nhighway at Dignan. Then turns and walks the other way, into\nthe distance.\n\n                                            BLACKOUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY\n\nA cold day on a nice country club course. Anthony watches\nBob hit a hard slide straight into the rough. Bob stands\nthere in a frozen follow-through. Then he suddenly swings\nhis club and hums it down the fareway. He starts to walk\nback to the golf cart.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Bob, where you going?\n\n                         BOB\n            I'm not playing any more golf.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Why not?\n\n                         BOB\n            Cause I'm not getting any better.\n            It's a waste of time.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            You've only been playing for two\n            weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to\n            learn this game.\n\n                         BOB\n            You think I'm improving?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (pause)\n            Yes. You just got to stick with it.\n\nBob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath and\nstarts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.\n\nINT. GOLF CART. DAY\n\nIn the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.\n\n                         BOB\n            You don't have to talk about it if\n            you don't want to.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            No, I don't mind.\n\n                         BOB\n            I know it must of been a bad\n            experience. But it doesn't sound\n            like it was your fault.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Well, I didn't mean to electrocute\n            him. But the whole operation was my\n            idea.\n\nMONTAGE: Electronics wizardry. Splicing wires. Buzzing\nelectrodes. A filament lights up blue. Pliers and clippers\nrewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,\nelectrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.\n\n                         ANTHONY (VO)\n            It took six months of research. I\n            did all the wiring myself. Switched\n            AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.\n            Shorted out the generator. The\n            whole school was shut down.\n\n                         BOB (VO)\n            That's pretty complicated for a\n            senior prank.\n\n                         ANTHONY (VO)\n            I don't like that word prank, Bob.\n            I was trying to do something more\n            than a prank.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL. DAY\n\nA large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in the\nshade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. White\nflashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.\nMozart plays in the distance.\n\nStudents begin to swarm out into the yard.\n\n                         ANTHONY (VO)\n            I wanted to create an event.\n            Something everyone would remember.\n            And at first it worked perfectly.\n            The whole school was standing\n            around outside. Kids running all\n            over the place. Everybody laughing.\n\nEXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY\n\nAnthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Even the school custodian Swifty\n            thought it was great. He kept\n            laughing and shaking his head the\n            whole time he tried to disconnect\n            the generator. And then suddenly\n                   (snaps his finger)\n            total silence except for Swifty\n            hanging off the generator with his\n            leg stuck to it being electrocuted.\n\nAnthony stares down the fareway.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Actually he died of a heart attack\n            brought on by the shock. He was an\n            older guy.\n\nINT. GOLF CART. DAY\n\nAnthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty\n            since first grade. He was Dignan's\n            medicine man for Indian Guides.\n            They called each other Rattlesnake\n            and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan\n            came to visit me he would act like\n            he and Swifty weren't that good of\n            friends, but that was just to make\n            me feel better. The whole rest of\n            the school had turned against me.\n\nEXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY\n\nAnthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers.\nFuture Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            At first they were going to charge\n            me with manslaughter. That's partly\n            why I was in custody so long. Sixty\n            days.\n\n                         BOB\n            Sixty days?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Yeah. One minute you're studying\n            Great Expectations and the next\n            minute you're drawing the Holy Mary\n            for some kid who tried to stab his\n            girlfriend.\n\n                         BOB\n            Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Prison tatoos.

He says,\n            Little man, take your foot and put\n            it in your pocket. I said, No, how\n            about I take my foot and I stick it\n            up your ass? Man, we went to war\n            right there. I hit him so hard I\n            knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.\n            But this motherfucker wouldn't go\n            down. Then all the sudden, out of\n            nowhere, Dignan came up behind him\n            and smashed a bottle on his head.\n            And that big old boy went down.\n            That's how I met Dignan.

And I'll tell you who we're\n            going to want: Kumar Banijamali.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            Is he good?\n\n                         MR. HENRY\n            He's damn good.\n\nINT. KUMAR'S ROOM. DAY\n\nKUMAR is about sixty-five with white hair. He's short and\nwears a pale-green button-down shirt, dark trousers, and\nsandals. His room is small and has everything he needs in it.\nBooks. Little TV. Possessions from all over the world.\n\nKumar sits on his bed. Anthony and Dignan sit in wooden\nchairs. Kumar stares out the window. They sit for a long\nsilence.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            So what do you think of the plan,\n            Mr. Kumar?\n\nKumar shrugs. Pause.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            We'd love to have you on the team.\n\nKumar nods. He looks at a plant growing by the window.\nSilence.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What is that? An orchid?\n\nKumar shakes his head. Sighs deeply. Long pause.\n\nKumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. He throws\nit on the bed. He undoes his trousers and takes them off.\nAnthony looks at Dignan. Kumar takes off his socks, then his\nshorts. He is naked. He walks over to his dresser and takes\nout a small satchell. He looks around the room. Right at\nAnthony. He walks quickly toward him. Anthony gets nervous.\nKumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. He\npulls a towel out from underneath Anthony. He puts his hand\non Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.\n\n                         KUMAR\n            Good plan.\n\nHe goes out. Anthony and Dignan sit there for a minute.\nThey're a little disoriented.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            What do you think?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n                   (nods)\n            He seems pretty good.\n\nINT.

He used\n            to tear this place apart.\n\nMr. Henry laughs. Bob smiles sheepishly. Jackson stands\nthere for a minute looking around the room.\n\n                         JACKSON\n            Your brother was up here the other\n            day.

He suddenly\nlooks back at Anthony.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            God. Isn't this great? Working on\n            the job. Got a wheel man. Got a\n            safecracker. Good friends with Mr.\n            Henry.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Yeah.

DAY\n\nWe see the team assembled around a table. They're drinking\ncoffee and looking at pictures, charts, maps, diagrams,\ntools. Dignan passes out some walkie talkies.\n\nThey test out some smoke cannisters on the roof. Dignan\nthrows one down. They all run for cover.\n\nApplejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a\ndeserted parking lot.\n\nWe see Kumar working on a safe. He wears a stethoscope and\nlistens to the tumblers. He turns the dial. Dignan is timing\nhim with a stopwatch.\n\nKumar opens the safe. He looks at Dignan. Dignan nods with a\nserious expression on his face.\n\nEXT. RAILROAD TRACKS. DAY\n\nAnthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in\nthe warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and\nshorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the\nhood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and\ntucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.\nThey've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty\nyards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick\nflurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the\ntracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.\nPioneer stock.\n\n                         MR. HENRY\n            Look at that woman. She's what?\n            Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't\n            let herself go. I appreciate an\n            older woman who has a commitment to\n            her body.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            So do I.\n\nThey watch her ride down the street.\n\n                         MR. HENRY\n            Tell me something. What the hell\n            kind of name is Dignan?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            I'm not really sure. I think it's\n            Irish. Or maybe --\n\n                         MR. HENRY\n            I guess what I'm trying to say is\n            what the hell kind of person is\n            this Dignan?\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What do you mean what kind of\n            person? He's a good person.\n\n                         MR. HENRY\n            Sure, sure. He's a great person,\n            and I'd call bullshit on anybody\n            who said differently.

Then around a corner to a smaller\nelevator as it opens: Bob's inside.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            What are you doing?\n\n                         BOB\n            My walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't\n            tell what's going on.\n\n                         ANTHONY\n            Let me see it.\n                   (fiddling with it)\n            Did you drop it?\n\n                         BOB\n            No.\n\nDignan's still standing in the hall as Anthony and Bob come\naround the corner.

They've got bags from\nJack in the Box. They're drinking drinks and shakes. One of\nthem is holding a jam box. They stop.

DAY\n\nDignan comes out the front door pulling Applejack, semi-\nconscious, to the car. Dignan loans Applejack against the\ndoor. He checks Applejack's pockets for the keys. He looks\naround on the ground.\n\nHe hears sirens in the distance. He looks across the parking\nlot. Two squad cars screech in off the street.\n\nDignan takes off into the building.\n\nINT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY\n\nDignan sprints down the corridor. Races up the stairs. Runs\ndown hall after hall.\n\nTwo COPS appear out of the elevator.\n\n                         COP\n            Freeze!\n\nDignan ducks into a stairwell. He runs down the stairs and\ninto another corridor. He can hear cops yelling from two\ndifferent directions. He crosses a catwalk. Cuts through an\noffice. Pulls open a door and goes into one of the freezer\nrooms.\n\nCops come yelling down the hallway. Dignan runs through the\nfreezer room and tries the other door. It's stuck. Three\nCOPS come inside. Dignan instantly puts his hands up in the\nair.\n\n                         COP #1\n            Drop the fucking gun!\n\n                         COP #2\n            Don't move!\n\nDignan drops the gun. The cops rush him. They nail him into\nthe wall. Get him in a headlock, pulling hard.\n\n                         COP #3\n            You're caught, buddy.\n\nThey pull him into the hallway.\n\n                         COP #1\n            Put your hands behind your back.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I'm not going to do anything.\n\n                         COP #3\n                   (squeezing his neck)\n            Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't\n            you know what freeze means? Don't\n            you speak fucking English?\n\n                         COP #1\n            Take it easy.\n\nThey put him face down on the floor and cuff him.\n\n                         COP #1\n                   (to Dignan)\n            Calm down.\n\nThey move him down the corridor. Dignan's nose is bleeding.\nHe looks terrified.\n\nApplejack is sitting propped up against the wall. He's got\nan oxygen mask on his face and a team of paramedics and cops\naround him. Somebody's taking his blood pressure. Another\none's giving him an IV.\n\n                                            CUT TO:\n\nAnthony running down a sidewalk. He drops his gun in a\ntrashcan without slowing down. He crosses a bridge and runs\ninto the the trees.\n\n                                            BLACKOUT.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT. COUNTY JAIL. DAY\n\nThere's snow in the air. The prison yard is wide with dry\ngrass and concrete. It's split up by chain link fences.\nGuards sit in the towers.\n\nDignan's wearing an inmate jumpsuit. Anthony and Bob walk\nwith him across the yard. They've brought along two bags of\nfood from a hamburger place.\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            I said to the DA, That cop who hit\n            me must of given me CRS disease.\n\n                         BOB\n            What's that?\n\n                         DIGNAN\n            That's just what the DA asked.
