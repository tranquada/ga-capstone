COFFEE SHOP. DAY\n</b>\nAnthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is\nin his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless\nwide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the\nintricacies of firearms.\n\n<b>                         TEMPLE\n</b>            A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a\n            firearm. But anything you hold in\n            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A\n            wrench. A ballpoint pen.\n\n<b>                         ANTHONY\n</b>            A ballpoiht pen?\n\n<b>                         TEMPLE\n</b>            Anyone who tells you a ballpoint\n            pen is not a weapon needs intensive\n            psychiatric treatment. You can\n            stick them in the esophagus. You\n            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.\n\nThey nod seriously. Temple laughs.\n\n<b>EXT. FIELD. DAY\n</b>\nThey're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an\nopen pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in\nmetal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper.

There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.\nThe doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the\ncoffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some\ndiagrams laid out.

DAY\n</b>\nAnthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in\nthe warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and\nshorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the\nhood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and\ntucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.\nThey've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty\nyards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick\nflurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the\ntracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.\nPioneer stock.\n\n<b>                         MR. HENRY\n</b>            Look at that woman.

He goes to the\nrefrigerator. He takes out a chocolate cake and a carton of\nmilk. He pours himself a glass of milk. He goes over to the\ntable with the cake and sits down. He cuts himself a piece\nof cake. He swallows two pills, one at a time, each with a\nlong drink of milk.

Dignan slides a crowbar\nout of his jacket. He snaps open the door. They go in. It's\na small office with a desk and a little safe in the corner.\nDignan clears everything off the desk with one quick sweep\nof the arm. He puts down the briefcase and opens it up.

They look to\nDignan.\n\nDignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks\nat Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.\n\n<b>                         DIGNAN\n</b>            So long.\n\nBob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as\nthe line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob\nsmiles.\n\nThe line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan\nlooks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has\nchanged. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look\ncold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and\nthe line of inmates disappears into the cell block.\n\nAnthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.\n\nHe walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.\n\n<b>                                            FADE OUT.\n</b><b></b></pre>\n<b>\n</b><b>\n</b><b></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Bottle Rocket</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Owen Wilson\" title=\"Scripts by Owen Wilson\">Owen Wilson</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Wes Anderson\" title=\"Scripts by Wes Anderson\">Wes Anderson</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Bottle Rocket Script.html#comments\" title=\"Bottle Rocket comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:01:04.018114"}
