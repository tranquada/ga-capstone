There are rumors of\n\t\tsecret meetings with North Korean\n\t\trepresentatives, but U.S. officials\n\t\tinsist the North must first hold\n\t\tdemocratic elections, and halt its\n\t\tnuclear weapons program -- as they\n\t\tclaimed to have done back in 1995.\n\nWe CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.\n\nThen ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.\n\nThe SCENE returns to LAX.\n\n\t\t\t\tREPORTER (VO)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTensions remain high since last\n\t\tyear's skirmishes between North Korea\n\t\tand the U.S. So any chance of the\n\t\tcommunist North joining the Pacific\n\t\tPartners seems highly unlikely.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see\nhis eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.\n\nJaval takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription\nbottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to\na van with a phone company logo on it.\n\n\n\nEXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY\n\nThe Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns\ninto the heavy morning traffic.\n\nINT.

The Mercedes merges onto\nthe freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.\n\nThe thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings\nas a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to \"11\" cruises by.\n\nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY\n\nEven 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.\nThe Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts\non his blinker to take the 405 South exit.\n\n\n\nEXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY\n\nThe van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a\nprocession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass\narcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.\n\nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY\n\nAs they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a\nswitch on his radio-control unit...\n\nCLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS\n\nSix small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps\non the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds\nof sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,\nscores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...\n\nWIDER\n\nCausing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most\nhellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction\nPILE-UP you can imagine.\n\nDozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe\ntheir neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some\nfishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still\ncoming onto the overpass.\n\nBrakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,\nglass shatters.\n\nAnd then it gets really nasty...\n\nA Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The\ntruck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.\n\nIt SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...\n\nAlong with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept\nover the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.\n\nThey plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.\n\nINT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY\n\nSam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver\nslams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tDRIVER\n\t\t\t(Korean)\n\t\t[Stay in the car.]\n\n\n\nEXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY\n\nA nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The\nMercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.\n\nINT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN & ROADWAY - DAY\n\nJaval slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He\nslips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.\n\nANGLE WITH JAVAL\n\nas, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and\nrolls under the Mercedes.\n\nThe undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal\nstops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He\nattaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,\nthen rolls back toward the van.\n\nINT.  MERCEDES - DAY\n\nOblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as\npolice and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP\nmotorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.\n\nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY\n\nSweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks\nanother radio unit. Working.\n\nEXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY\n\nThe CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and\ntraffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,\nJaval looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the\nMercedes onto the 405 south.\n\nINT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY\n\nJaval drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio\nunit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.\n\nJaval fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...\n\nBut he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.\n\nINSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES\n\nJaval's device is armed, and waiting...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE TO:\n\n\n\nEXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-\nfamily homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.\n\nEvery house on the block except the one we're in front of has\na \"For Sale\" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the\nsigns, they've been there for quite a while.\n\nINT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nIt's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.\n\nPETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering\nhim. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.\n\nCarson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,\nmuscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.\n\nMiranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes\nabove all else that one should never raise one's voice.\n\nCarson groans... he's DREAMING...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nEXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY\n\nQuick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.\nCops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.\n\nCarson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK\nacross from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in\nhis hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.\n\nSuddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the\nbank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nINT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nCarson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tSon of a bitch!\n\nHe bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped\nbikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRANDA\n\t\tPete... please... we have to be up\n\t\tearly tomorrow. Call the police.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tYeah, right.\n\nHe races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,\nits LCD reading \"ARMED.\"\n\nHe grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.\nForgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door\nopen. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tShit!\n\nMIRANDA\n\npulls the pillows over her head and sighs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMIRANDA\n\t\tNot again...\n\nEXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nCarson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by\nthe streetlight --\n\nWhere two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang\nconvertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've\nmade in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.\n\nCar-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying\nthe ignition switch out of the dashboard.\n\nAsshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a\ncrowbar. His partner keeps working.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nAsshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the\ncrowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts\nBLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.\n\nCarson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each\nother like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal\nechoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming\nhouse and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.\n\nSurprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto\nthe lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.\n\nAs he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler\nheads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.\n\nCarson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it\ninto Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.\n\nCarson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against\nhis raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm\nbreaks, and Carson tosses him aside.\n\nSeeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off\ntoward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot\nfaster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.\n\nWIDER\n\nCarson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and\nFLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --\n\nAnd NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.\n\nCarson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp\nscrewdriver and jabs at Carson with it.\n\nThen, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A\nWESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble\nwith their sidearms.\n\n\t\t\t\tWESTEC GUARD\n\t\tEverybody... chill! Bikini boy! On\n\t\tthe ground!\n\nAsshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the\nscrewdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tAsshole was trying to boost my car!\n\nANGLE ACROSS STREET\n\nCarson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas\nand a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tMike -- call 911!\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIGHBOR\n\t\tBeen trying...\n\t\t\t(has a cordless phone)\n\t\tIt's busy.\n\t\t\t(to Guards; re Carson)\n\t\tHe's the good guy, you schumcks.\n\nThe Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a\nTASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.\n\nCLOSER\n\nHolding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He\nnotices the \"Neighborhood Watch\" sign has graffiti spray-\npainted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His\nNeighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?\n\nThe PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right\nunder the gushing SPRINKLER.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tI hate this fuckin' town.\n\nEXT.

HAN are\nhaving breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.\n\nAmbassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiqu\u00c8s.\nHe's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's\ndressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.\n\nMrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her\nhusband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a\nsummery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.\n\nAmbassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the\n\"Nirvana\" logo on his T-shirt.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMBASSADOR HAN\n\t\t\t(Korean)\n\t\t[Go change.]\n\nAmbassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.\n\n\t\t\t\tAMBASSADOR HAN\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t[You smell like a fireplace.]\n\nA BUTLER appears with a phone.

JAVAL'S VAN - DAY\n\nIn the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJAVAL\n\t\tVery good. You may go now...\n\nHe speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an\norange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a\nquick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.\n\nJaval grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'\nupper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a\ngravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.\n\nHe drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a\nsmall smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.\n\nINT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY\n\nCarson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling\noff, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an\nexercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading\nthe sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.\n\nANGLE ON TV\n\nA perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to\nus from a local NEWS COPTER.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBOBBI\n\t\t\t(on TV)\n\t\t...Good morning, Summit Day!

He rests the barrel on his\narm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.\n\nCarson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST\ncrosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the\nfront fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-\ndeco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl.

The area is\ncovered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.\n\nCarson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He\nHEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nJaval has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He\ncan either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,\noutdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story\nconcrete tower.\n\nHe jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into\nthe elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.\n\nJaval comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up\nthe hill.

He sees Javal's motorcycle,\nabandoned, lying on its side...\n\nAnd then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a\nBULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.\n\nCarson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He\nmoves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end\nof the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is\nhanging through the broken window.\n\nCarson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of\nthe tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\t\t(into radio)\n\t\tHe's on foot, at the base of the\n\t\televator tower!\n\nBut just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...\n\n\n\nEXT.

HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY\n\nIn the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way\nthrough traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.\n\nBehind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.\n\nOn the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini\nand Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as\nthey all try to catch up to Javal.\n\nThe helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill\nbelow Franklin.\n\nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY\n\nJaval hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting\nhim on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.\n\nCarson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.\n\nSuddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.\nIt's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.\n\nJaval FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.\n\nColonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.\n\nCarson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!\n\nINT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY\n\nColonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the\nhelicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with\none hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.\n\nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY\n\nEveryone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.\nIt appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then\nit gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.\n\nJaval tries to move away, but one of its landing runners\nSMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself\nagainst the inside of the Geo's roof.\n\nSnared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly\ntoo high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.\n\nINT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY\n\nThe wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to\nset down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.\n\nThe Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible\nto control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...\n\nEXT.  VINE STREET - DAY\n\nThe copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol\nRecords building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.\n\nThe impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's\nheading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the\nbottom of the hill.\n\nINT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY\n\nJaval, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the\nglass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.\n\nEXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY\n\nThe copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12\nfloors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor\nshatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like\nbackwash.\n\nThe Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.\n\nCLOSER\n\nFrom the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear\nthe copter is not going to stay where it is for long.\n\nThe Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with\nfear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the\nsteering wheel to keep from falling out.\n\nANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW\n\nIn the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...\nanything to get away from the area below the impact.\n\n\n\nJAVAL\n\nreacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the\nseat start to slide toward the open door.\n\nHe gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS\nagain... he loses his grip...\n\nAnd, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.\n\nWe stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...\n\nThen LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his\nchest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.\n\nEXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY\n\nCarson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering\ncopter and Geo are right above it.\n\nGrimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the\nparking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...\n\nUnable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.\nAll he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.\n\nAbove, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...\n\nCarson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at\nJaval's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.\n\nWith a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away\nfrom the building.\n\nCarson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the\nstreet, diving for cover behind a car.\n\nBEHIND CARSON\n\nthe copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.\n\nNEW ANGLE\n\nSooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.\nHe throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON\n\t\tFingerprint it.\n\t\t\t(to Walther)\n\t\tHe's not gonna tell us where to find\n\t\tthe hostages...\n\t\t\t\t-more-\n\n\t\t\t\tCARSON (Cont'd)\n\t\t\t(looks at watch)\n\t\tMeaning we got exactly 80 minutes to\n\t\tfigure it out for ourselves.\n\n\t\t\t\tWALTHER\n\t\tFigure it out?!
