Yuri Karkov\r\n          is in the centre of them, a girl on either arm.\r\n          Chang leads the Cops into the bar. He fires two shots into the\r\n          ceiling. That shuts everyone up and gets the Russian Criminals\r\n          up and ready for a confrontation.

Totally still.\r\n          The ceremonial music begins...\r\n          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,\r\n          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried\r\n          out before a fight takes place.\r\n          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their\r\n          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing\r\n          shapes and outlining fighting positions.\r\n          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;\r\n          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches\r\n          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost\r\n          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about\r\n          to follow...\r\n\r\n<b>           FADE OUT.\r\n</b>          The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring\r\n          up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild\r\n          excitement.

In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside\r\n          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.\r\n          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple\r\n          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.\r\n          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...\r\n          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers\r\n          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.\r\n          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.\r\n          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang\r\n          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between\r\n          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.\r\n          Then a look between the two fighters.\r\n          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks\r\n          back at him without emotion.\r\n\r\n<b>                          REFEREE\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          (IN THAI)\r\n</b>           Fight.\r\n          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack\r\n          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps\r\n          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right\r\n          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of\r\n          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his\r\n          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's\r\n          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps\r\n          back.\r\n          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an\r\n          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,\r\n          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.\r\n          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.\r\n          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.\r\n          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.\r\n          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.\r\n          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike\r\n          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack\r\n          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and\r\n          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects\r\n          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.\r\n          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds\r\n          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs\r\n          and punches to his upper body and face.\r\n          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to\r\n          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under\r\n          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to\r\n          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him\r\n          fall down.\r\n          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make\r\n          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this\r\n          enrages Julian.\r\n          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a\r\n          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns\r\n          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,\r\n          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's\r\n          down. But again no killer punch.\r\n\r\n<b>                          JULIAN\r\n</b>           Come on.\r\n          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.\r\n          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take\r\n          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.\r\n          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a\r\n          look of intense anger and frustration.\r\n\r\n<b>                          CUT TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          INT.

Chang is reluctant to attack.\r\n          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian\r\n          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as\r\n          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own\r\n          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,\r\n          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike\r\n          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.\r\n          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and\r\n          Kanita.\r\n          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches\r\n          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.\r\n          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.\r\n\r\n<b>                          REFEREE\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          (IN THAI)\r\n</b>           Break.\r\n          The two fighters step back from each other.

Nadee comforting\r\n          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks\r\n          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing\r\n          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...\r\n          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan\r\n          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.\r\n          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring\r\n          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at\r\n          but can't make it out.\r\n          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When\r\n          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the\r\n          fight - urging him to hit harder...\r\n          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...\r\n          On Chang.
