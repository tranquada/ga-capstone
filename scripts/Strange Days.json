We hear:\n\n<b>                             VOICE\n</b>              Ready?\n\n<b>                             SECOND VOICE (LENNY)\n</b>              Yeah.  Boot it.\n\n    A burst of bright white static exploding across the\n    darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to\n    street sounds and rapid breathing.\n\n    AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a\n    car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view\n    swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the\n    windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front\n    seat.\n\n    Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in \"our\"\n    hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into\n    a coat pocket.\n\n<b>                             OUR VOICE\n</b>              Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.\n\n    The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose\n    over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.\n    He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.\n\n<b>                             LANE\n</b>              Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for\n              waitin' till I get this fuckin thing\n              on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or\n              what?\n\n    He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.\n    Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up\n    over our field of view.\n\n    We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.\n\n    WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of\n    view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is\n    human experience.\n\n    The driver is a Hispanic guy named \"SPAZ\" DIAZ.  Lane is a\n    white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of\n    crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald\n    with primer.\n\n<b>                             LANE\n</b>              Next alley... just pull in slow.\n                      (turning to us)\n              Hurry up will ya.  Here.\n\n    He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks\n    down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the\n    rounds, snap it closed.\n\n    Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights\n    illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is\n    making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which\n    he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside.\n\n<b>                             LANE\n</b>              Let's go.\n\n    Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our\n    ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.\n    Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.\n\n    Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,\n    surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing\n    him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: \"quiet\" in any\n    language.\n\n    Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get\n    them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with\n    the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the\n    front room.\n\n    We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.\n\n    Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent\n    THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged\n    Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young\n    Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we\n    put the gun on them.\n\n<b>                             OUR VOICE\n</b>                      (shouting, edgy)\n              Don't move, don't talk, don't do\n              nothing.\n\n    Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the\n    owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway\n    covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he\n    steps back from the cash-register.\n\n    We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred\n    bucks in tens and fives.\n\n    Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the\n    kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy\n    Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.\n\n    Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four\n    scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a\n    dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon\n    handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking\n    them in.\n\n    Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at\n    the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.\n    We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one\n    way, then the other.\n\n    Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the\n    alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the\n    car.\n\n    Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning\n    rubber as he launches back down the alley.\n    SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers\n    wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--\n    KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out\n    into the street.\n\n    The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us\n    as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.\n    He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between\n    cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.\n\n    The cop car surges onto the street behind us.\n\n    Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the\n    way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the\n    cars, into the intersection.\n\n    A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.\n    Another red light ahead.\n\n<b>                             LANE\n</b>              Don't stop!\n\n    Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ\n    cuts the wheel but too late...\n\n    Clipping the truck and spinning.\n    The street outside smearing past like the view from a\n    Tilt-a-whirl.\n\n    Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and\n    launching up and over, and--\n\n    KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.\n\n    It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.\n    Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.\n\n    Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.\n    Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.\n\n    Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.\n    Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside\n    down, blood pumping across his face.\n\n    Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.\n\n    We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness\n    of an alley.\n\n    Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody\n    yelling.\n    Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.\n    Ahead, Lane running into shadow.\n\n    Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.\n    Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding\n    the door open as we dive through into--\n\n    A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.\n    Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.\n    Shit.\n\n    Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.\n\n    The POV is finally broken by a...\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE\n</b>\n    But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in\n    extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are\n    closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is\n    watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              This is great... the doors are all\n              locked.  Who are these losers,\n              friends of yours?\n\n<b>                                                 CUT TO:\n</b>\n    BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is\n    coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look\n    down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a\n    couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.\n    Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is\n    unlocked.\n\n    Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running\n    all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:\n    an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon\n    onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue\n    daylight.\n\n    Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car\n    burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank\n    explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't\n    slow.  We're running all out.\n\n<b>                             LENNY (V.O.)\n</b>              Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.\n              Oh, oh, end of the line boys.\n\n    Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.\n    Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and\n    separated by a 20 foot alley.\n\n    But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and\n    makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.\n    We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders\n    or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across\n    the roof.\n\n<b>                             LANE\n</b>              Come on!  Fucking jump man!\n\n    The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...\n    Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...\n    WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.\n\n    Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody\n    fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along\n    the edge.\n\n    Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.\n    A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,\n    oblivious.\n    Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives\n    way.\n    A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up\n    but...\n    Snapping a look down--\n    Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy\n    scream--\n    Ground rushing up--\n\n    Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and\n    running out of the way as--\n    Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.\n    Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.\n\n    Only silence.  And blackness.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE\n</b>\n    Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on\n    Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that\n    looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except\n    they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples\n    and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK \"TRODES\".  Lenny whips\n    off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in\n              snuff.  How many times I hafta tell\n              you?!\n\n    Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as \"TICK\", a pale-\n    skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather\n    jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground\n    of the near future.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Well you could've at least warned\n              me.  You know I hate the zap... when\n              they die.  It just brings down your\n              whole day.  Jeez, Tick.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Sorry.\n\n    LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you\n    better check to see if you still have your ring after you\n    shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian\n    jacket, and what he thinks of as a \"power tie.\" His Rolex\n    isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around\n    his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he\n    has energy, and heavy street smarts.\n\n    Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick\n    is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit\n    70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled\n    inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to\n    him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks\n    like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.\n    The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,\n    and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They\n    are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes\n    of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,\n    and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at\n    the moment it is happening.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't\n              the cops put it in evidence?\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              With all the blood I guess they\n              didn't see the rig.  Guy had it\n              under a wig.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Yeah, but how'd it get to you?\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.\n                      (off Lenny's impatient\n                       look)\n              Okay, okay... I got a deal with some\n              a the paramedics.  My guy pages me\n              and I pick it up at the morgue.  So\n              whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be\n              worth at least a grand.  Right?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I\n              don't deal this kind of product, you\n              know that.  I'll give you four for\n              it, cause I've gotta cut off the\n              last bit.  And my customers want\n              uncut.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Fuck that!  The last part's the\n              best.  You dry-dive six stories and\n              blammo!  Jack right into the Big\n              Black.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's\n              policy.  I got ethics here.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,\n              man!  It's what people want to see,\n              and you know it.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              So lay it off to somebody else.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I\n              got to get this rig fixed.  Look at\n              it...\n\n    Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized\n    stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record\n    deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the\n    SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the\n    human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The\n    whole works are covered with congealed blood.\n\n<b>                             TICK\n</b>              Give me six at least.  This's a good\n              clip, here.

I always\n              bring you choice.\n\n    Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,\n    pulling out a tape.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Sure, like this low-grade shit here,\n              some girl in a fight with her\n              boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.\n              Nothing happens.

Lenny works the cellular, gets\n    messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of\n    traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing\n    stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid\n    who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food\n    chain.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Look, Jerr.

She is swearing and crying,\n    runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale\n    face.

Her breath\n    comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.\n\n    She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking\n    behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.\n    Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over\n    the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car\n    as the beam passes over.

The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to\n    her and the cops jump out.\n\n    Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-\n    tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose\n    groceries go flying.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN\n</b>\n    Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the\n    filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with\n    fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a\n    hurdler.\n\n    The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws\n    his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...\n    a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.\n\n    Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.\n    They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop\n    and his boy wonder.\n\n    The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.\n\n    MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A\n    couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains,\n    eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.\n\n<b>                             DISPATCHER (V.O.)\n</b>              Do you request back-up?\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b>              Negative.  Suspect is a black male,\n              age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.\n\n    A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A\n    few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops'\n    footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a\n    pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close.\n\n    Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a\n    full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes,\n    thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman\n    straight-arms his pistol.\n\n<b>                             ENGELMAN\n</b><b>              FREEZE!\n</b>\n    Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her\n    momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams\n    into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She\n    gasps for breath and looks up to see...\n\n    ... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she\n    just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries\n    to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun\n    through the window.\n\n    Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and\n    presses herself up against the solid wall next to the\n    door, where he can't see her.\n\n    OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.\n    He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.\n\n    Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to\n    her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is\n    still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag\n    her right out through the window.\n\n    She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets\n    go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her\n    long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the\n    window, screaming.\n\n    Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.\n\n    Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a\n    red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol\n    and fires at Iris.\n\n    She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.\n    A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has\n    short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many\n    pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for\n    air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.\n\n    SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train\n    disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in\n    his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the\n    cap.\n\n    CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate\n    network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of\n    the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern\n    like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal\n    box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.\n\n    Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes\n    going crazy wide.\n\n<b>                             ENGELMAN\n</b>              Oh shit.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    EXT./ INT.

Gang graffiti marks the walls.\n    Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like\n    somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the\n    place an eerie, dead glow.

He just deadbolts the\n    door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then\n    carries his Haliburton...\n\n    ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his\n    reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-\n    bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet\n    couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the\n    corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a\n    table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this\n    stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the\n    windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes\n    everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech\n    low-life.\n\n    He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same\n    infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated\n    by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.\n\n    Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes\n    off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on\n    the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.\n    This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing\n    to look forward to but another day of the hustle.\n\n    He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,\n    fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,\n    squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say\n    \"FAITH.\" Only the dates are different.\n\n    He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some\n    minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes\n    his eyes.  And hits PLAY.\n\n<b>    PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:\n</b>\n    We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a\n    YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious\n    that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.\n    The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking\n    up at our discomfort.\n    We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we\n    realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating\n    backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny\n    afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all\n    around us.\n\n    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately\n    in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is\n    beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild\n    dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She\n    moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her\n    eyes instead of concentrating on skating.\n\n    Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at\n    Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help\n    us up.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast\n    Forward.\n\n    BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...\n\n    We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the\n    steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and\n    comfortable.\n\n    Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing\n    \"Three Little Birds\".  Faith, covered with a sheen of\n    sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We\n    follow her.\n\n    She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts\n    to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up\n    Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her\n    and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing\n    behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.\n\n    He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the\n    music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her\n    sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her\n    shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A\n    voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he\n    can replay and relive the moment.\n\n    Their eyes meet in the mirror.\n\n    They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her\n    halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,\n    responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly\n    to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.\n    The intimacy is power.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>                      (laughs)\n              Hey, you going to watch or you going\n              to do?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Watch and see.\n\n    We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they\n    close in a kiss.  We (Lenny) keeps ours open.  Our hands\n    pull her halter over her head.  Then she pulls up on\n    Lenny's T-shirt, laughing.  We see it go over our eyes,\n    blocking the view for a moment.\n\n    Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest.  We are looking down\n    at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as\n    Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling\n    our belt and we--\n\n    CUT TO LENNY in the here and now.  Lost in playback memory\n    bliss.  He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically\n    recorded pleasure.\n\n    BACK TO POV.  Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing\n    her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down\n    together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled\n    sheets.  She looks up, right at us...\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              I love your eyes, Lenny.\n                      (she touches our\n                       eyelids)\n              I love the way they see.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation.  He touches\n    his tongue to his fingertip.\n\n    IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her.  She gasps\n    and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both\n    hands.  There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the\n    creaking bed frame.  She rocks with the rhythm of our\n    thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes.  He\n    reacts to the past orgasm.  The tape ends, Lenny slowly\n    takes off the trodes.  There is a tiny tear at the corner\n    of his eye.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.

Lenny goes to the kitchen in his\n    underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is\n    empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle.\n    Good morning.\n\n    The TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling\n    around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the\n    ground.

Lenny sucks on the popsicle while\n    he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony\n    he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt\n    beneath the jacket.

He lands on the sidewalk, then\n    scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES\n    loom toward him.  He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with\n    dignity (but quickly) toward the car.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Are we having a bad night?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>                      (glancing back)\n              Let's talk in the car.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT./ EXT.

Lenny opens his eyes to see...\n    Mace's glowing countenance.\n\n    She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head\n    and tossed them out the window.

Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting\n    out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Listen, can we talk a little bit\n              here, like two rational adults?\n\n    Mace hits a button on the dash.

RETINAL FETISH\n</b>\n    Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the\n    Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a\n    converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of\n    dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A\n    thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of\n    chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp\n    atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the\n    clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.\n\n    There are many large video screens running a continuous\n    montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of\n    disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.\n\n    The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a\n    lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You\n    can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and\n    software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).\n\n    Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with\n    metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:\n    it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur\n    9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check\n    her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.\n\n    Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go\n    immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of\n    light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.\n    SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding\n    court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.\n\n    It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record\n    business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep\n    everyone in his orbit.\n\n    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback\n    as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed\n    jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is\n    wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer\n    silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her\n    features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she\n    is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.\n\n    Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And\n    show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable\n    -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His\n    fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure\n    behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a\n    moment of suspended time.\n\n    ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.\n\n    Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage\n    consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's\n    personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-\n    thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the\n    classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE\n    BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY\n    MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Who's the new side of beef in Tran's\n              posse?\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Guy named Wade Beemer.

Mace scowls at the\n    tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Forget her.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              She still loves me.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              She thinks you're a bucket of dog\n              vomit.

You living in a perfume\n              commercial?  She's a hard-climber\n              that dropped you like a used tampon\n              when she got a better ride.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              You'll see.\n\n    Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the\n    crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as\n    in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny\n    virtually ignores them.\n\n    Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him;\n    no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little\n    tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense.\n\n    Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they\n    stay casual.\n\n    Lenny doesn't break stride.  It's like a game of chicken\n    without cars.  Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his\n    shadow.  Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes.  Tran\n    gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.\n\n<b>                             TRAN\n</b>              You come to peddle me some tapes,\n              Lenny?

She is\n    wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her\n    milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving\n    her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.\n    Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.\n\n    SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering\n    sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses\n    like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice\n    becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The\n    pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on\n    its eve of judgment.\n\n    Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels\n    across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that\n    her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.\n\n    A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.\n\n    Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.\n    But it always has the same effect on him.  He is\n    transported into another world by her, a world in which\n    there is only the two of them.\n\n    TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the\n    puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform\n    before.  Holy shit.\n\n    Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any\n    way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting\n    it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now\n    shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and\n    holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she\n    possibly could.  Then nothing.\n\n    When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk\n    away.  Fuck you.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.

He looks a\n    it, puzzled.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              What's that?  Present from Faith?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              No idea.\n\n    He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts\n    the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget\n    about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY.\n\n    POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is\n    distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost\n    black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,\n    almost hyper-real.\n\n    WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.\n    An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance\n    goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time.\n\n    We come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB\n    sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door.\n    Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              It's a test pattern so far.\n\n    \"Our\" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical\n    gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the\n    rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches\n    down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with\n    lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very\n    professionally picked.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Alright, a little B&amp;E action.\n\n    We enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are\n    open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved\n    hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the\n    moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON.\n\n    The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear\n    holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the\n    subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.\n\n    The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has\n    avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,\n    dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of\n    course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense\n              build.\n\n    The Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly\n    and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's\n    balcony from the one next door.\n\n    The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the\n    pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the\n    other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into\n    the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a\n    woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She\n    turns...\n\n    It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.\n    Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.\n    Pours the Scotch shakily.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He\n    gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.\n\n    IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We\n    can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy\n    the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and\n    silently opens it, slipping inside.\n\n    We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her\n    movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around\n    the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in\n    the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.\n\n    We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for\n    a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She\n    comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying\n    her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes\n    whip back.  Widening in terror.\n\n    She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.\n    We go after her.\n\n    Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small\n    automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it\n    and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the\n    palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,\n    lightning-fast.\n\n    We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the\n    bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short\n    hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she\n    somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the\n    hall.\n\n    Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.\n    Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric\n    stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the\n    shoulder blades.\n\n    She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The\n    Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...\n    nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and\n    drag her back into her room, locking the door.\n\n    ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              What is it?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT\n              NOW!  Just go!  GO!\n\n    Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing...\n\n    WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom...\n    propping her up with her back against the white tile\n    wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one\n    to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And\n    crying.\n\n<b>                             IRIS\n</b>                      (voice distorted)\n              I haven't seen your face... I\n              haven't heard your voice... you can\n              still let me go...\n\n    ZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She\n    jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved\n    finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.\n\n    Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.\n    Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands\n    place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.\n    What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside\n    the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to\n              his own output.  She's seeing what\n              he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.\n\n    Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-\n    eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And\n    she can feel what he feels.\n\n    The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls\n    out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip\n    it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now\n    she can only see what the wearer sees.\n\n    And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.\n    With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor\n    knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by\n    segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous\n    clicking sound.\n\n    We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-\n    shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look\n    down and slide the knife under the side band of her\n    panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her\n    throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we\n    draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to\n    tease her with the prospect of her death.\n\n    MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and\n    pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the\n    Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in\n    his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is\n    experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.\n\n    IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below\n    his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling\n    in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her\n    hips forward onto him, pushing into her.\n\n    Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She\n    feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the\n    killer's exhilaration.\n\n    ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops\n    the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his\n    eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may\n    reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He\n    pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.\n\n    IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting\n    horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly\n    wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists\n    one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his\n    forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.\n\n    The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the\n    T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her\n    jaw.\n\n    Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes\n    at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...\n    blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,\n    death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same\n    instant.\n\n    ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he\n    just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains\n    out of his skull.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>                      (like a mantra)\n              On my God.  Oh my God.\n\n    BACK TO POV, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the\n    knot.  Iris' head lolls.  Her mouth is slack and open.  We\n    remove her blindfold.  Her eyes are half-lidded.  Very\n    dead looking.  Our fingers gently push them wide open.\n\n    BACK TO LENNY, looking like he has been gut kicked.  He\n    gasps for breath.\n\n    TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from\n    side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.\n    He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,\n    the pupil wide, seeing nothing.\n\n    A burst of static.  End of tape.\n\n    Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and\n    practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull\n    off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk\n    to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He\n    doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.\n\n    Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to\n    his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up\n    again.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              My God, Lenny.  What is it?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Black.  Jack.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Blackjack?  I don't understand--\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said\n              she needed my help and I... aw\n              Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker\n              killed her.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Are you sure it's real?\n\n    Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel.  Mace\n    follows his glance.  They notice for the first time: cop\n    lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon.\n\n    CLOSE on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the\n    coroner's van.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    EXT.  PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT\n</b>\n    Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls\n    into the lot and slides up to Max's car.  Max is sitting\n    in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings\n    from a take-out carton.  He looks up as Lenny and Mace get\n    out of the limo.  Sees their expressions.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Ohhhh shit.\n\n    TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,\n    has his head propped in his hands.  His eyes are\n    distant... replaying.  Still shocked to his soul.  Mace\n    paces nearby.\n\n    Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes\n    on, playing back the tape.  His face is transformed into\n    an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.  With\n    shaky hands he stops the deck.\n\n    Opens his eyes.  Long beat.  He glances down at the dim-\n    sum carton in his hands.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Well...

He's still thinking about Faith...\n\n    ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and\n    Mace comes into view.  She's waiting for him.  He steps\n    forward.  But he can't open the grillwork door.  And the\n    elevator doesn't stop.  It keeps going down.  Lenny,\n    spooked, works the door hard... as Mace disappears from\n    view above him...\n\n    ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement.\n    With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney-\n    faced.  Last stop.  All out.\n\n    Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it\n    open.  Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully\n    behind him in one fluid move.

Corto doesn't even look at it.  Gets it over his\n    hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of\n    brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face.  Watch parts\n    go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up\n    against a column.\n\n    Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely.  She works\n    him expertly, with a series of painful jabs.\n\n    He sags to his knees.  Not only is this painful.  It's\n    goddamn humiliating.

Mace\n    drives Vita head first into the steel column.\n\n    Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace.  This is a mistake.\n    Mace doesn't fight fancy.  And she doesn't fight fair.\n    She fights to win.  And she is awesomely fast.  Her moves\n    are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs\n    she has been trained to use as a security driver.\n\n    Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a\n    little stunned.  She has blood dripping in her eyes and\n    can't see too well.\n\n    But she charges him.  And -- being the gent that he is --\n    he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair.\n\n    Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the\n    ground, leaving...\n\n    CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in\n    Mace's face.

She continues to\n    twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee,\n    groaning.  She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel\n    hard across his face.  Mace releases his wrist and he\n    crumples in a heap.\n\n    She and Lenny back out the door.

I know you still love me.\n\n    She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his\n    sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He\n    is out cold.\n\n    Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't\n    seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving.\n\n    And we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and\n    it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but\n    there it is.\n\n    She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now.\n    Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty\n    top of the couch, sighs.

A MANILA\n    ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his\n    front window, next to the door.  \"NERO\" is printed on the\n    envelope.\n\n    Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is\n    around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars\n    and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He\n    stares at it with dread.\n\n    Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He\n    picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He\n    notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and\n    punches PLAY.\n\n    POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated\n    signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is\n    walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment\n    building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken\n    deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-\n    like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...\n    the back door to Lenny's apartment.\n\n    The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the\n    door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We\n    are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping\n    in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.\n\n    Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively\n    looking around the door frame to the living room.  There\n    is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.\n\n    Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside\n    him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep\n    under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow\n    plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends\n    the blade... click, click, click, click.\n\n    The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward\n    Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.\n    Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.\n\n    The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.\n\n    LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He\n    feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel\n    anything.\n\n    Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he\n    inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line\n    over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his\n    heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under\n    control.\n\n    Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.\n\n    His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently\n    into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and\n    pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently\n    toward the kitchen.\n\n    Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.\n    He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine\n    under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,\n    wincing as he chambers a round.\n\n    Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He\n    edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes\n    intact.\n\n    Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny\n    look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the\n    bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed\n    casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon\n    jacket over a tank-top.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Whatup Lenny?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>                      (hands shaking)\n              Jesus, Mace!\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.

The yard is located in the vast no-\n    man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near\n    harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for\n    New Years Eve.\n\n    CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with\n    the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace\n    is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A\n<b>    TAZER.\n</b>\n    Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows\n    at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace\n    fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low\n    amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice,\n    then runs off behind some parked cars.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              That's a handy little attitude\n              adjuster.\n                      (sees his car)\n              Damn.  I'm boxed in.\n\n    Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other\n    cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks\n    the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace\n    covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes\n    occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a\n    glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them\n    warily.\n\n    Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,\n    still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: \"HELP ME.\n<b>    IRIS.\"\n</b>\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              What's it say?\n\n    He crumples the note.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Nothing.  Let's go play this back.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they\n    reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is\n    the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but\n    looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and\n    Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or\n    later he would lead them to the tape.\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b>              Give me the tape.

He takes out the tape\n    and holds it out toward Spreg.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b>              Absolutely.\n\n    And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that\n    way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he\n    points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--\n\n    Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through\n    the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into\n    Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists\n    out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog.\n\n    Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and\n    dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from\n    Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.\n\n    Mace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk\n    of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's\n    chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into\n    the car, starting it up.\n\n    Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body\n    armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing.\n    He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it\n    pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet\n    proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked\n    nearby, to give chase.\n\n    Spreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in\n    gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even\n    has the door closed.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT./ EXT.

Security driving.  She whips some\n    moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>                      (holding on)\n              Oh no, we're not being followed,\n              Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.\n\n    They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.

The truck stays with them.\n\n    Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an\n    AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which\n    riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.\n    The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the\n    rounds don't come all the way through.\n\n    Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact\n    drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light-\n    standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse\n    buildings which front the harbor.\n\n    The truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at\n    the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders\n    along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange\n    sparks.\n\n    Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to\n    turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the\n    brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,\n    stopping before it reaches the end.\n\n    They are trapped.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    EXT.

Lenny and Mace keep their heads down\n    below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a\n    steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the\n    armored body panels hold.\n\n    Lenny is punching his cellular.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              It's okay, Lenny\n                      (he looks at her\n                       hopefully)\n              They'd never get here in time\n              anyway.\n\n    Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door\n    on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from\n    the sideswiping.\n\n    Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a\n    gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the\n    pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents\n    onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the\n    seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.\n\n    He tosses the flare under the limo...\n\n    KA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The\n    Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all\n    Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are\n    covered in roaring flames.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>                      (matter-of-fact)\n              This is bad.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              The gas tank's going to go any\n              second!\n\n    Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful\n    Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link\n    fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A\n    fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black\n    water.\n\n    Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car\n    sinks.\n\n    UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting\n    there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the\n    big streetlights at the end of the pier.\n\n    INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Are you out of your fucking mind?!\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Fire's out, isn't it?\n\n    She scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the\n    rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the\n    huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her\n    shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move\n              it.

Okay?\n\n    He nods.  BLAM!!  She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.\n    The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.  Lenny\n    and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.\n\n    ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside\n    the slimy concrete wall.  Lenny comes up beside her,\n    spluttering.  Her hand goes over his mouth.  They are in\n    the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road\n    ties.\n\n    Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the\n    black water over the barrels of their AKs.\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b>              Let's get out of here.\n\n    They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.\n\n    Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,\n    chest-deep in the water.  They hear the truck pulling\n    away.  They let out a big exhalations of relief.\n\n    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes\n    squishing.  They leave a shiny trail behind them.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              I can't believe we had to give them\n              the damn tape.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Yeah, me neither.

He is laughing, talking to someone in\n    the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's\n    sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously\n    entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a\n    bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly.\n\n    Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's\n    hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest\n    and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and\n    swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash.\n\n<b>                             JERIKO\n</b>              Shit.

He pulls the car\n    down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a\n    warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously.\n    Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars\n    whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on\n    Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.

Spreg\n    is white-lipped with rage.  Years of frustration coming to\n    a head.  Too many disciplinary actions, too many\n    suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they\n    do.\n\n<b>                             JERIKO\n</b>              It's a song about a cop who meets\n              his worst nightmare, a nigger with\n              enough political juice to crush his\n              ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna\n              be famous.\n\n    Spreg looks around the empty street.  Looks at Engelman.\n    Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement.

Rolling around, holding his guts.\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b>                      (shouting)\n              Hey...

Diamanda is\n    screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots\n    Replay four more times.\n\n    We spin one-eighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM!\n    BLAM!  BLAM!  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her\n    knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun\n    toward us.\n\n    We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The\n    sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in\n    front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail\n    and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running.\n\n    Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and\n    Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the\n    thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward.\n    Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to\n    us.\n\n    We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past\n    behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel.\n    Backing away from it.\n\n    We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim\n    through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns\n    over the roar of the train.\n\n    Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign\n    right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and\n    running.\n\n    Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't\n    see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs\n    heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to\n    fill the night.\n\n    Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand\n    takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest.\n    We move forward into the dark train-yard as--\n\n<b>    THE TAPE ENDS.\n</b>\n    And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.

Then he nods,\n    smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in\n    the booth right next to him.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              That night Iris calls up, freaking.\n              She comes over and Tran watches the\n              tape.  He just loses it.  He can't\n              believe the disaster she's gotten\n              him into.  He's terrified the cops\n              will beat it out of her who she was\n              working for, and come looking for\n              him.\n\n    CUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is\n    telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we\n    don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin-\n    lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing.\n    Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's\n    poison.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Kinda guy you can count on in a\n              pinch.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Why didn't he just go public with\n              the tape?

It\n    blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like\n    a venomous snake.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              The scandal would wipe him out.

Faith looks back and sees:\n\n    TRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They\n    start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking\n    protesting people out of the way.\n\n    Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the\n    corridor.\n\n    Behind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA\n    shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path\n    with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling\n    the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.

In the whirling shapes and\n    colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a\n    white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the\n    bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he\n    uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw.\n    Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again,\n    smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny\n    sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass.\n\n    Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see\n    Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted\n    viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link\n    divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny\n    staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as\n    Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down\n    the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost\n    in the pounding darkness.\n\n    Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a\n    cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like\n    a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them\n    expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on\n    his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his\n    last run-in with her.

The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls\n    out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.\n    Mace's eyes go wide.  The boot of one of the cops is\n    inches from it.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Yeah, uh... he slipped on the\n              stairs.

Tran emerges, helping Faith out\n    with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as\n    they head for the elevators.\n\n    They push through a group waiting for an elevator... men\n    in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds.

Then I busted this\n              strung-out little teeny-hooker.\n              When I met Faith she was just\n              another runaway giving twenty dollar\n              blowjobs to buy crank.

There was a\n              light in her eyes... and she had\n              this voice.  It was scary, all that\n              pain coming out of that little body.\n              Like she could take all the hurt and\n              rage of the entire world and lift it\n              up to heaven in one voice.  I helped\n              her.  And I promised her that I'd\n              always be there... to protect her.\n                      (long pause)\n              See?  It's not about what's in her\n              head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't\n              let go of the promise.

She kisses him lightly\n    on the cheek, where the tear-track is.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Come on, Lenny.

IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see\n    there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of\n    downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two\n    outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are\n    lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in\n    the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection\n    video screens are set up all over the place.\n\n    LA is connected to other cities all over the world by\n    satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time\n    zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as\n    midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.\n    It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia\n    blow-out.\n\n    Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in\n    it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial\n    Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as\n    they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It\n    may be the party of the century, but it looks like the\n    middle of a third world revolution.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              That's it.  Let's bail.\n\n    And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the\n    protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's\n    wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around\n    the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.\n    Snappy.\n\n    Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her\n    .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls\n    the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between\n    her upper thighs.\n\n    In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a\n    quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the\n    top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular\n    legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her\n    braids now loose and full, like a mane.\n\n    Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is\n    caught by a sudden realization:\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Mace... you're a girl.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Good, Lenny.

Come\n              on.\n\n    They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.\n    Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the\n    fore.  The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.\n    Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an\n    unparted Red Sea of man and machine.\n\n    They will move through the various strata of society as\n    they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.  It\n    is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed\n    into a few square blocks.  There are cops everywhere.\n    Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.\n\n    Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...\n    metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500\n    dollar-a-plate ticket.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Got your ticket?\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              No.  They must have sent it to my\n              beach house by mistake.\n\n    Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace\n    follows.

PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE\n</b>\n    Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices\n    something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with\n    NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically.\n    He opens it...\n\n    ... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE\n    falls out into his hand.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    EXT.

Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he\n    charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He\n    hammers through anybody that gets in his way.\n\n    Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian\n    runner.\n\n    Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead\n    of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black\n    shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a\n    doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her\n    pass.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE\n</b>\n    LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on\n    his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches\n    down.\n\n    IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar\n    monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the\n    door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite.\n\n    Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the\n    balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes\n    back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a\n    bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls\n    it across the room, and it shatters against the wall.\n\n    We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer.\n    Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping\n    loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.\n\n    THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at\n    the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up.\n\n    THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of\n    static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We\n    climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We\n    turn her onto her back.\n\n    She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A\n    warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her\n    wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at\n    the head of the bed.\n\n    The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set\n    of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery\n    gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.\n\n    LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head\n    in horror...\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              No, no, no...\n\n    IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow\n    plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full\n    length.\n\n    Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open,\n    starting between her breasts and going down out of sight.\n    She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The\n    killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body,\n    which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife\n    deftly cuts off her panties.\n\n    We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her\n    hips, pulling her to us.\n\n    ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror,\n    mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from\n    the tape.\n\n    BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of\n    our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins\n    to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt\n    slowly.\n\n    LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his\n    stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,\n    he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares\n    wildly around the room.\n\n    One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror\n    he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is\n    covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,\n    propped up against the wall on the far side of the night\n    stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom\n    door.\n\n    Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of\n    the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a\n    trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on\n    the sheet.\n\n    It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.\n\n    The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees\n    that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.\n    He looks like Tick did.\n\n    Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The\n    fireworks and screaming outside sound like some\n    nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an\n    end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He\n    hits PLAY.\n\n    THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches\n    with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.\n\n    Lenny feels the climax building.\n\n    Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out\n    herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases\n    the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.\n\n    Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet\n    doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of\n    the bed and on it Faith.  And on her...\n\n<b>    ... MAX.\n</b>\n    Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both\n    gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering\n    orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.\n\n    LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not\n    have the strength or the will to stop the tape.\n\n    IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right\n    at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure.\n    Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches\n    for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump\n    forward onto her, and her face fills the POV.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              I love you.\n\n    Lenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend\n    is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the\n    tape is not over...\n\n    THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to\n    a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran\n    is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's\n    ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.\n\n    Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from\n    the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle\n    right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the\n    room, too stunned to resist.\n\n<b>                             TRAN\n</b>              You're going to die, you're both\n              going to fucking die.\n\n    We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the\n    muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using\n    the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor\n    with his back to the mirror.\n\n    Our eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see\n    Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking\n    fast.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              This piece of puke hired me to kill\n              you, baby.  Do you believe that?\n              Isn't that right, Tran?  You\n              pinhead.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              Oh my God.  I don't believe this is\n              happening.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Believe it.  Now bring me the\n              trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              What're you going to do?\n\n    Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max\n    puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out\n    of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the\n    deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way\n    up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when\n    he figures that out, starts to splutter.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              You can't just... kill him.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              I'm not.  Just a little poach job.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              Jesus.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Hey, he was going to kill you.  And\n              this ratfuck paid to have Iris\n              killed, to save his own sorry ass.\n\n    Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into\n    his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his\n    words.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              You shut the fuck up, right now,\n              I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!\n\n    K-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's\n    just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this\n    has already happened relative to Lenny entering the\n    suite).\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Look, baby, it's now of never... the\n              guy is a known input junkie, so a\n              little OD won't surprise anybody.\n              It's the only way we can be\n              together.  You know it's true.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              My God.\n\n    We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is\n    about to happen, or to the realization that she has the\n    capacity to let it happen.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Here's how much I love you, baby.\n\n    She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He\n    punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to\n    muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a\n    screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming\n    outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special\n    madness.\n\n    The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly\n    at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the\n    fireworks inside Tran's head.\n\n<b>    THE TAPE ENDS.\n</b>\n    Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched\n    with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the\n    doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max\n    there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical\n    gloves look incongruous with his tux.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Don't make any assumptions about our\n              friendship, Lenny.\n\n    Lenny stands up, slowly.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know\n              you were colorblind, Max.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Only way I could stand your ties.\n\n    Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of\n    Lenny's waistband.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Where's Faith?\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              I sent her to the party.  I figured\n              I'd wait up here until you killed\n              Tran.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              What makes you think I'm gonna kill\n              Tran?\n\n    Max looks out the window at the fireworks.  Waits for a\n    flash, knowing that the bang will follow.  Keeping his own\n    .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran.\n    BLAM!  One right into Tran's forehead.  The crack of\n    thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              You just did.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Jesus!\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              You know, statistically that's the\n              second most common word people say\n              right before they die.  Shit being\n              number one.\n\n    Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own\n    .45 trained on Lenny.  Lenny knows the next bullet is for\n    him.  He does what he does best... talk.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran\n              in, being on his payroll, and shot\n              me.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              That's pretty much the way it\n              happened.\n\n    CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the\n    edge of the door frame.  She looks through the crack\n    between the door and the jam.  Her POV: Max with the gun\n    on Lenny.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Wait a minute.

I don't always do exactly\n              what I'm told.\n                      (she walks slowly\n                       toward them)\n              So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching\n              me?'  And you said -- come on Max.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for\n              free.'\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,\n              because I like the feeling of\n              someone watching me.  I acquired\n              the taste from Lenny.'\n\n    Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the\n    asshole of the western world.  Faith moves up close to\n    Max.  She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders,\n    caressing them.  Max grins, realizing she is 100% with\n    him.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>                      (to Lenny)\n              And then she said, 'Since we're\n              going to be spending so much time\n              together--'\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              'We might as well make the best of\n              it.'\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>                      (crushed)\n              Jesus, Faith.\n\n    Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders\n    and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in\n    both hands and deflects the gun.\n\n<b>                             FAITH\n</b>              Lenny!!\n\n    Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls\n    the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the\n    room.\n\n<b>                             MAX\n</b>              Fucking bitch!!\n\n    BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who\n    is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith\n    grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...\n\n    His \"hair\" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,\n    containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a\n    Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with\n    effort as he struggles with Lenny.\n\n    He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES\n    of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,\n    screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.\n    The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on\n    them from above.\n\n    Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one\n    advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.\n    Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into\n    the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,\n    falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand\n    against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces\n    Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops\n    the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a\n    split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters\n    under the couch, out of play.\n\n    Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,\n    and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the\n    wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious\n    punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes\n    down to one knee.\n\n    Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws\n    a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away\n    from the downthrust.\n\n    The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into\n    the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,\n    pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles\n    him and they crash together through a sliding glass door\n    onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.\n\n    Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him\n    backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny\n    twists with all his strength and spins Max into the\n    railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and\n    Max topples.\n\n    As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him\n    over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious\n    crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny\n    has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he\n    is being strangled by the tie.\n\n    Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with\n    his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the\n    handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max\n    sees it coming a split second before it happens.\n\n    Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's\n    hands.\n\n    Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12\n    stories down, on top of a video truck.\n\n    Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his\n    jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All\n    the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.\n    Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.\n\n    Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his\n    quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the\n    bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.\n\n    He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps\n    walking.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n    DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with\n    Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,\n    walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,\n    aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns\n    and...\n\n    ... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.\n    Spreg curses and looks around.\n\n    Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to\n    her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his\n    baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people\n    out of the way as he runs.\n\n    Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people\n    out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes\n    from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.\n\n    Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned\n    out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above\n    the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the\n    shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people\n    block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.\n\n    ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting\n    tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his\n    pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the\n    tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt\n    of her pistol.\n\n    Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across\n    her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace\n    bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her\n    palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.\n    Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his\n    hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops\n    to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.\n\n    A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She\n    spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can\n    fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,\n    using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his\n    neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.\n\n    She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He\n    convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping\n    like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes\n    over and kicks his gun away.\n\n    She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at\n    her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises\n    the baton.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!\n\n    He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that\n    she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one\n    of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.\n\n    The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're\n    seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other\n    wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD\n    COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and\n    see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a\n    police baton.  The cops advance toward her.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Wait.  Let me tell you what's going\n              on here--\n\n    The nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes\n    to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.\n    She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the\n    breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them\n    watches fascinated, gasping.\n\n    Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b><b>              NO!!  NO!!!\n</b>\n    They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay\n    down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach.\n\n    A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking\n    cops.\n\n    And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,\n    then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,\n    Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.\n    They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.\n    It becomes a brawl.\n\n    Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the\n    trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-\n    gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a\n    space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,\n    like the divine light of God.\n\n    Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.\n    Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on\n    the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled\n    down.\n\n    Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland\n    and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.\n    Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and\n    Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still\n    handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat\n    extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.\n    Then...\n\n    He points at the two prone cops.\n\n<b>                             STRICKLAND\n</b>                      (to the nearest\n                       officers)\n              These two are under arrest for\n              murder.\n\n    Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's\n    squid tape.  Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are\n    over.  The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an\n    otherworldly quality.  Like they are in some celestial\n    court of judgment.\n\n<b>                             STRICKLAND\n</b>              Get some medical attention for this\n              woman.\n\n    Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.  He runs to\n    Mace and kneels next to her.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Are you okay?\n\n    A trickle of blood runs down her face.  She nods weakly\n    and reaches for him.  They hug, then they both wince in\n    pain.  Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and\n    Engelman.  One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              I got 'em, Lenny.\n\n    ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the\n    closest cop.  He waves them back with it.  Then puts it in\n    his mouth and fires.\n\n    He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting\n    blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,\n    bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at\n    that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.\n\n    SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His\n    glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun\n    in one blood-drenched hand.\n\n    Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he\n    begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps\n    the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the\n    center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He\n    has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they\n    can't shoot him.  Several officers shout at him to drop\n    the weapon.  You barely hear them over the pandemonium of\n    the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b><b>              SHOOT!\n</b>\n    Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,\n    completely unhinged, lurches toward them.  Engelman's body\n    slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a\n    foot wide.\n\n<b>                             SPREG\n</b><b>              YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!\n</b>\n    He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...\n\n    Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take\n    the fire, and...\n\n    POW POW POW!  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.\n    He drops like a sack of cement.\n\n    The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.\n\n    He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He\n    opens his eyes.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Yeah, what?\n\n    CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.  Mace and Lenny are being\n    escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of\n    cops who part the rowdy mob before them.\n\n    Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.  Lenny's\n    arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.  They\n    support each other like two soldiers after a battle.\n\n    Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,\n    passing near them.  She is in handcuffs and her eyes are\n    dull.  Mace turns back to Lenny...\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Are we under arrest?\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Naw.  They just have to ask us a\n              few questions... for about six\n              hours.\n\n    They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his\n    arms.  Life out of Death in the endless continuum.  Lenny\n    pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.\n\n    They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.  The EMT\n    guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit\n    jacket.  Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad\n    car.  Lenny sees...\n\n    The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at\n    midnight.  We hear a roar passing through the crowd.  A\n    huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as\n    everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.\n\n<b>                             CROWD\n</b><b>              TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...\n</b>\n    Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.\n\n<b>                             CROWD\n</b><b>              SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...\n</b>\n    Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance\n    from darkness.\n\n<b>                             CROWD\n</b><b>              FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW\n</b><b>              YEAR!\n</b>\n    The exultation of the moment flows through them as the\n    people lift their voices in a great cheer.  Balloons are\n    released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.\n    Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>                      (grinning)\n              Hey, Lenny.  We made it.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              Yeah.  We did.\n\n    She hugs him.  Then pulls back.  Friends... yes.  And\n    always.  But there's that line that she can't cross.  Only\n    he can do that.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Well...\n                      (she shrugs)\n              Get going.  You're still bleeding.\n\n<b>                             LENNY\n</b>              See you downtown.\n\n<b>                             MACE\n</b>              Yeah.  See you there.\n\n    TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.\n    They open the back door for him.  The walk is\n    hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the\n    hysteria of the crowd.  He looks back at Mace as the\n    paramedics help him up into the ambulance.  The back doors\n    close.\n\n    ON MACE, watching him go.  A cop gently takes her arm,\n    opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her\n    face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.  She gets into\n    the back seat.  The door slams.  Strickland gets in next\n    to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move,\n    and...\n\n    There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...\n    The door is wrenched open...\n    A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...\n\n    Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion.\n    He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like\n    there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let him\n    break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.\n\n    Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his\n    watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't\n    need a watch, it's...\n\n<b>    12:01  A.M.
