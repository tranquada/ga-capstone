DAY. 6\r\n</b>          The black-oD-black surges around a wide curve,\r\n          revealing only three vehicles still in pursuit.\r\n          The first machine is Wez's big road bike, the\r\n          GOLDEN YOUTH riding pillion. It is followed by a\r\n          bizarre road racer and a strange dune buggy.\r\n          As the black-on-black crests a rise MAX is confronted\r\n          by a tangle of wrecked vehicles on the road ahead.\r\n          He swerves, slaloms through the wrecks and accelerates\r\n          into a sweeping right hand curve.\r\n          WEZ ramps his bike over the first wreck and corrects,\r\n          avoiding the other wrecks.\r\n          The road racer ramps two wheels over the first wreck\r\n          but cannot correct. It clips the second wreck, sends\r\n          it spinning, then continues after the black-on-black.\r\n          The dune buggy decides to avoid the wrecks altogether\r\n          and veers off the road to the right.
