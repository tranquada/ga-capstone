PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY\r\n\r\n          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS\r\n          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.\r\n          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this\r\n          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar\r\n          tugging at the leash.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          Take him off the leash.\r\n\r\n                         \u00c2\u0080\u00a2 WILL\r\n          There's a place up ahead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          32.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

Stay where I can see\r\n          you.\r\n          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins\r\n          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's\r\n          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.\r\n          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then\r\n          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A\r\n\r\n          GROVE OF TREES.\r\n\r\n                         WILL (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (YELLING)\r\n          Remember - stay where I can see you\r\n          - if you got lost in these woods\r\n          I'd never find you.\r\n\r\n          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE\r\n\r\n          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM\r\n\r\n          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          Go ahead. Climb!\r\n          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the\r\n          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.\r\n          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is\r\n          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and\r\n          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.\r\n\r\n          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER\r\n          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy\r\n          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.\r\n          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE\r\n\r\n          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP\r\n\r\n          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.\r\n\r\n          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP\r\n\r\n          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...\r\n          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at\r\n          the mountains. Then down to Will below.\r\n          Will's pointing to his watch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          33.\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands\r\n          beside him on the forest floor.\r\n          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's\r\n          much taller now - over five feet.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Sorry to rush you - got to get home\r\n          and check on Walter.\r\n          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT\r\n          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman\r\n          struggles to control him.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n\r\n                         (INCREDULOUS)\r\n          Is that a chimpanzee?\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Don't worry - he's harmless. Very\r\n          sweet.\r\n          The big dog keeps BARKING.\r\n          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,\r\n\r\n          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.\r\n          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls\r\n          the Woman away.\r\n\r\n                         WILL (CONT'D)\r\n          Guess he had it coming.\r\n          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE\r\n\r\n          LINGERING ON THE LEASH.\r\n           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?\r\n\r\n          EXT. ZOO - DAY\r\n\r\n          Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -\r\n          machinery everywhere.\r\n\r\n          INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds\r\n          himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Where's Dr. Stewart?\r\n\r\n                         S VETERINARIAN\r\n          She doesn't work here anymore.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          34.\r\n          Doesn't work here anymore?\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Do you know where she went?\r\n\r\n                         VETERINARIAN\r\n          I'm sorry - I don't.\r\n          Will's deeply disappointed.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ZOO - DAY\r\n\r\n          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong\r\n          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.\r\n          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.\r\n          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches\r\n          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One\r\n          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE\r\n\r\n          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.\r\n          Caesar's transfixed.\r\n          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.\r\n          Neither makes a sound.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Come on.\r\n          As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb\r\n          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO\r\n\r\n          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.\r\n\r\n          INT. ATTIC - DAY\r\n\r\n          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS\r\n          walk home from school.\r\n          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to\r\n          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl\r\n          smiles, flirts back.\r\n          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.\r\n          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.\r\n          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with\r\n          these teens. He wants to be one of them.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          35.\r\n\r\n          INT. BATHROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.\r\n          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their\r\n          posture, their gait.\r\n\r\n          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A\r\n\r\n          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.\r\n\r\n          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST\r\n\r\n          LIKE ALPHA'S.\r\n           He runs two fingers down the length of it.\r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's\r\n          tension here, but we can't place it yet.\r\n          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S\r\n          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,\r\n          staring at it.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          Turn it around, Dad. You're using\r\n          the wrong end.\r\n          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.\r\n          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the\r\n          old man, adjusting the spoon.\r\n          Will watches. Heartbroken.\r\n\r\n          INT. LAB - DAY\r\n\r\n          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE.

The mouse hesitates, confused.\r\n          He backs away from the cone.\r\n          A LAB TECH makes a note.

LIVING ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older\r\n          woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images\r\n          as she changes channels.\r\n          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a\r\n          SPACE LAUNCH.

As he draws the white\r\n          birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-\r\n          portrait.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY\r\n\r\n          The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck\r\n          chair.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.\r\n          REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.\r\n          As if he's not sure where he is.\r\n          Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE\r\n\r\n          FRONT DOOR.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n          Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street\r\n          ahead of him is quiet. No one around.\r\n          Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the\r\n          sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n          He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of\r\n          SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The\r\n          car SMASHES into a nearby tree.\r\n\r\n          INT. ATTIC - DAY\r\n\r\n          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the\r\n          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.\r\n          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,\r\n          then turns to YELL at someone.\r\n          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.\r\n          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker\r\n          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.\r\n          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the\r\n          menacing finger.\r\n\r\n                         HUNSIKER\r\n          Look at the front of my car you\r\n          stupid, stupid old man!

Stop!\r\n          Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.\r\n          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old\r\n          man off his back.\r\n          Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE\r\n\r\n          \"JABBING\" POINTER FINGER.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n                         HUNSIKER\r\n          Aaaaaaaah!\r\n          Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE\r\n\r\n          OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.\r\n\r\n                         WALTER\r\n          Caesar!\r\n          Caesar hesitates.

He scrabbles to his feet and\r\n          sprints for his house.\r\n\r\n          CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S\r\n\r\n          TOO BIG TO FIGHT.\r\n          He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS\r\n          HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar\r\n          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to\r\n          block Hunsiker's entrance.\r\n          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to\r\n          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -\r\n          Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.\r\n          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances\r\n          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.\r\n          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to\r\n          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR\r\n\r\n          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.\r\n          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.\r\n          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE\r\n\r\n          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.\r\n          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n          Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree\r\n          branch and swings from tree to tree.\r\n          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across\r\n          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.\r\n          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front\r\n          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.\r\n          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.\r\n\r\n                         HUNSIKER\r\n          Please no...\r\n          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.\r\n          But then he sees something across the street that abruptly\r\n          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -\r\n\r\n          BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.\r\n          He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.\r\n          All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

On\r\n          both of you.\r\n          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this\r\n          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          I'm sorry to trick you this way,\r\n          but you would never have agreed.

The pain in his eyes is\r\n          matched only by Caesar's.\r\n          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.\r\n          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a\r\n\r\n          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.\r\n\r\n          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE\r\n          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.\r\n          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          This way.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          47.\r\n          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then\r\n          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.\r\n          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.\r\n          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...\r\n\r\n          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.\r\n          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor\r\n          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.\r\n          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND\r\n\r\n          THEIR CAGES.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE\r\n          Caesar - over here.\r\n          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for\r\n          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE\r\n\r\n          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.\r\n          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.\r\n\r\n          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Stupid monkey.\r\n\r\n          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS\r\n\r\n          THE BETRAYAL.\r\n          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to\r\n          the ceiling, searching for a way out.\r\n          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES\r\n          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:\r\n\r\n          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.\r\n          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW\r\n          THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...\r\n\r\n          EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY\r\n\r\n          .and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,\r\n          away from the Ranch.\r\n\r\n          INT.

CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER\r\n\r\n          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.\r\n          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the\r\n          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.\r\n          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,\r\n          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.\r\n          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR\r\n\r\n          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD\r\n\r\n          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.\r\n          This is ROCKET.\r\n          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage\r\n          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.\r\n          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a\r\n          challenging eye to Caesar.\r\n\r\n          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!\r\n          A terrifying display of power and dominance.\r\n\r\n          DODGE (O.S.)\r\n          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.\r\n          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening\r\n          look to Caesar - moves off.\r\n          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.\r\n          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to\r\n          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in\r\n          an occasional rotted vegetable.\r\n          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels\r\n          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-\r\n          looking dog food.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.\r\n          Bet you don't get none of that in\r\n          the suburbs.\r\n          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL\r\n          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney\r\n          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          49.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Think that's funny? That funny to\r\n          you, you hairy prick?\r\n          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.\r\n\r\n                         RODNEY\r\n          Look at that!\r\n          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE\r\n          One thing you can count on: Long as\r\n          there are humans on this earth,\r\n          you'll always be a monkey in a\r\n          cage.\r\n          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.\r\n          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his\r\n          back as a shield.\r\n          The water BLAST is relentless.\r\n          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a\r\n          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the\r\n          floor.\r\n\r\n                         RODNEY\r\n          What about his clothes? Might\r\n          cause problems with the other apes.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE\r\n          Leave 'em.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

A seven year old chimp,\r\n          raised since birth.\r\n          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his\r\n          voice.

Notices that the other cages\r\n          are empty - that his cage door is open.\r\n          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet\r\n          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.\r\n          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.\r\n          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He\r\n          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING\r\n\r\n           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to\r\n          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE\r\n\r\n                         BRIDGE:\r\n          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.\r\n          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,\r\n          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT\r\n          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on\r\n          toward the atrium.\r\n          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.\r\n          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around\r\n          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,\r\n          orangutans with orangutans.\r\n          They haven't noticed him yet.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take\r\n          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED\r\n\r\n          LIKE A HUMAN.\r\n\r\n          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN\r\n\r\n          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE\r\n\r\n          MORE UPRIGHT...\r\n          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.\r\n          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes\r\n          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.\r\n           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the\r\n          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then\r\n          tosses it to Rocket.\r\n          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of\r\n          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.\r\n\r\n          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET\r\n\r\n          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.\r\n          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches\r\n          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the\r\n          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.\r\n          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.\r\n          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can\r\n          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.\r\n          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws\r\n          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.\r\n          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket\r\n          across the face.\r\n          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts\r\n          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're\r\n          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.\r\n          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.\r\n          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs\r\n          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.\r\n          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's\r\n          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...\r\n\r\n          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.\r\n          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.\r\n          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S\r\n          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He\r\n          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.\r\n          Caesar starts to move off -\r\n\r\n          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF\r\n\r\n          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.\r\n\r\n          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n          Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.\r\n          Out cold.\r\n\r\n          INT.

TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,\r\n\r\n          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.\r\n          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.\r\n          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,\r\n          restrained to a medical table.\r\n          Caesar opens his eyes.

CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S\r\n\r\n          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.\r\n\r\n          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.\r\n\r\n          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A\r\n\r\n          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.\r\n          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;\r\n          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it\r\n          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.\r\n          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.\r\n          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.\r\n\r\n          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE\r\n\r\n          SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -\r\n\r\n          OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.\r\n          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.\r\n          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking\r\n          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND\r\n\r\n          LOCKS HIM IN.\r\n          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making\r\n          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with\r\n          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.\r\n\r\n          CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Caesar\r\n          makes a motion with his hand.\r\n          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest\r\n          chimp. Then another one. Then another.\r\n          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND\r\n\r\n          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE\r\n\r\n          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.\r\n          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages.

RANCH - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.\r\n\r\n          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice\r\n          grabs his arm.\r\n\r\n                         MAURICE\r\n          Where go?\r\n\r\n                         CAESAR\r\n          Find Mother.\r\n\r\n          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the\r\n\r\n          GATE.\r\n          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL\r\n          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to\r\n          go with him.\r\n          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.\r\n          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he\r\n          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S\r\n\r\n          EYES HAVE CHANGED.\r\n          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes\r\n          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE\r\n\r\n          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.\r\n          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he\r\n          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the\r\n          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.\r\n          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?\r\n          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for\r\n          anything.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

They wait for\r\n          a break in traffic, cross the highway.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the\r\n          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.\r\n\r\n          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE\r\n          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.\r\n          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the\r\n          suburban street.\r\n\r\n          INT.

He gets out of bed,\r\n          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.\r\n\r\n          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.\r\n          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.\r\n          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.\r\n\r\n          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.\r\n          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the\r\n          darkness.\r\n          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.\r\n          His face is impossible to read.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          79.\r\n\r\n          INT.

WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the\r\n          doorway, taking it in.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from\r\n          Will's house.\r\n\r\n          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY\r\n          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.\r\n          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a\r\n          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE\r\n          AIR, head toward the Primate House.\r\n\r\n          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his\r\n          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two\r\n          chimpanzees run across the grounds.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries\r\n          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW\r\n          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.\r\n          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.\r\n          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to\r\n          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in\r\n          through the window.\r\n          Rocket follows.\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80.\r\n\r\n          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on\r\n          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.\r\n\r\n          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET\r\n          drop to the cement floor.\r\n          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED\r\n          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into\r\n          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.\r\n\r\n          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED\r\n\r\n          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.\r\n\r\n          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.\r\n          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH\r\n\r\n          KOBA.\r\n\r\n          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.\r\n\r\n          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES\r\n\r\n          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.\r\n          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.\r\n          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.\r\n          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED\r\n\r\n          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.\r\n\r\n          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING\r\n\r\n          HIS CAGE.\r\n\r\n          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.\r\n          ANGLE ON Caesar.\r\n          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the\r\n\r\n          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.\r\n          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.\r\n\r\n          NO CONNECTION.\r\n          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,\r\n          stares back at him.\r\n          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          81.\r\n          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB\r\n          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.\r\n\r\n          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...\r\n\r\n          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.\r\n\r\n          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.\r\n          They stare at each other.\r\n          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.\r\n\r\n          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on\r\n          his nightly rounds.\r\n          They look at each other, lay low.\r\n          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED\r\n\r\n          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-\r\n\r\n          TALKIE.\r\n          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off\r\n          together.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S\r\n\r\n          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.\r\n          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes\r\n          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.\r\n          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night\r\n          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,\r\n          oblivious.\r\n          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.\r\n\r\n           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 closes the door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          82.\r\n          CLICK.

CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's\r\n          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.\r\n          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still\r\n          asleep.\r\n          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.\r\n          Caesar freezes.\r\n          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the\r\n          shovel. Locks the door behind him.\r\n          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE\r\n          Rise and shine, assholes.\r\n          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in\r\n          the common area.\r\n\r\n          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          What the hell -\r\n          (seeing Cornelia's open\r\n\r\n                         CAGE)\r\n          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you\r\n          do that?\r\n          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds\r\n          it in front of him.\r\n          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          We're gonna go slow here, alright?\r\n          You're gonna go back in your cage,\r\n          you're not going to give me no\r\n          trouble.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          83.\r\n          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,\r\n           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.\r\n          Cornelia stands, watching.\r\n          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is\r\n          unreadable.\r\n          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL\r\n\r\n          AGAINST THE BARS.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Back!\r\n          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.\r\n          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,\r\n          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.\r\n          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward\r\n          the orangutan cage.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          We're going to have you fixed,\r\n          Einstein, that's for damn sure...\r\n          But first we're going to figure out\r\n          how you pulled this off...\r\n\r\n          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Go on.

Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.\r\n\r\n                         DODGE (CONT'D)\r\n          Get in that cage, you damn dirty\r\n          ape!\r\n\r\n          \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 CAESAR'S EYES NARROW.

YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.\r\n           That's when Caesar attacks.\r\n           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.\r\n           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN\r\n\r\n           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.\r\n          Dodge staggers back.\r\n          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.\r\n          Dodge crumples forward.\r\n\r\n          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.\r\n          Lights out.\r\n          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.\r\n          Rocket helps pull him inside.\r\n\r\n          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE\r\n\r\n          APES COME STREAMING OUT.\r\n          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS\r\n\r\n          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.\r\n          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts\r\n          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE\r\n\r\n          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO\r\n\r\n          HANDS TOGETHER.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          85.\r\n          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices\r\n          the palm and places his hand against it.\r\n          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest\r\n          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.\r\n          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR\r\n\r\n          OPEN PALMS WAITING.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Is it Caesar?\r\n          Will follows.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Will enters the clearing.\r\n          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the\r\n          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Huffs stands looking at his watch.

He walks towards will, bares his teeth.\r\n          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him\r\n          away.\r\n\r\n          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST\r\n\r\n          STARES HIM DOWN.\r\n\r\n          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.\r\n          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.\r\n\r\n                         CAESAR\r\n          Humans coming.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          No. I'm alone.\r\n          Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.\r\n\r\n                         WILL (CONT'D)\r\n          I owe you an apology.\r\n\r\n                         CAESAR\r\n          Will want Caesar dead.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          110.\r\n\r\n                         WILL\r\n          I thought you had killed a man.\r\n          But I should have known better.\r\n          Caesar's face is unreadable.

He looks up at Caesar.\r\n          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.\r\n          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.\r\n          Then the life passes out of him.\r\n\r\n          EXT.
