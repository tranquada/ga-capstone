DC-10 AIRLINER - NIGHT\n</b>\n       JACOB JOHNSON is sleeping.  It doesn't look like a pleasant \n       experience.  He is sixteen, dirty blonde, his eyes visibly \n       moving under closed lids as he sits huddle under a blanket in \n       his window seat.  The lights are dim -- the shade on the \n       window closed -- a bead of sweat dribbles down his forehead.  \n       The HUMMING of the jet's engines vibrates through the cabin.\n\n       The boy's eyes snap open.\n\n       Jacob glances around nervously.  He looks like an escaped \n       convict who just accidentally walked into the Policemen's \n       Ball.  A GREYHAIRED MAN two seats away from him gives the \n       teenager a cursory glance, then goes back to his book.  Jacob \n       lays his head back and tries to relax.  The engines continue \n       to drone.\n\n       Until a new noise starts.  A WHOOSHING NOISE.\n\n       The sound is very faint.  But distinct from everything else.  \n       Jacob frowns.\n\n       The noise gets LOUDER.  Jacob's sure he's hearing it now.  He \n       looks at the Greyhaired Man.  The man catches his eye and the \n       two of them stare at each other for a heartbeat - then Jacob \n       turns away.  The Man returns to his book.  And Jacob \n       immediately turns back to him.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Do you hear that?\n\n       The man gives him an annoyed look as the WHOOSHING gets \n       louder.\n\n<b>                           GREYHAIRED MAN\n</b>                 Hear what?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 That noise.\n\n<b>                           GREYHAIRED MAN\n</b>                 I don't hear anything.\n\n       The man turns back to the book as the sound gets even LOUDER -\n       - like it's coming closer.  Jacob squirms in his seat -- \n       sneaks a look at the man again.  How can he not hear that?  A \n       STEWARDESS walks by and Jacob catches her attention.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Excuse me.\n\n<b>                           STEWARDESS\n</b>                 Yes?\n\n       The WHOOSHING is completely obvious now.  The greyhaired man \n       tries to ignore the two people talking over him.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 What is that sound?\n\n<b>                           STEWARDESS\n</b>                 That's just the engines, sir.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No, it's different.  It's not the \n                 engines.  It's getting louder.\n\n       The man sighs -- the stewardess smiles patronizingly.\n\n<b>                           STEWARDESS\n</b>                 We're just gaining altitude to get above \n                 some rough weather.  That's the sound of \n                 the engines speeding up a bit.  \n                 Everything's fine.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Um...okay.\n\n       The stewardess walks away as Jacob sits back and starts to \n       bite his nails.  The whooshing is really starting to BLARE \n       now.  He looks between the seats in front of him -- twists \n       around to look behind.  He snaps back to the greyhaired man.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Can't you hear that?\n\n<b>                           GREYHAIRED MAN\n</b>                     (losing patience)\n                 Look, kid.  Will you relax?  It's just \n                 the damn engines, okay?\n\n       The man glares at him, and Jacob backs off.  The sound has \n       grown DEAFENING.  Jacob grinds his seat like he's going mad.  \n       He looks at the closed window.  He reaches out his hand, \n       grabs the handle then rips up the shade for all to see:\n\n       A 747 coming RIGHT AT US.\n\n       Jacob SCREAMS.  The planes CRASH.\n\n       Impact - decompression - explosion.  The hull of the cabin \n       buckles violently - moaning like a dying elephant - peeling \n       inward revealing RED AND GREEN STRIPING on the outside.\n\n       A huge wing section RIPS through the structure - barely \n       missing Jacob - taking the greyhaired man's head clean off - \n       nailing the stewardess in the gut and shoving her body across \n       and out the other side of the cabin.\n\n       And Jacob's seat drops down - sending him and us into:\n\n<b>       EXT. SKY - NIGHT\n</b>\n       Like an intricate ballet, Jacob, his body strapped to his \n       chair, tumbles away from the DC-10 and 747 as they seem to \n       merge and bend into some kind of mutant DC-47 - wings and \n       tails wrapping around each other as debris blooms out like a \n       flower and together they EXPLODE - a fiery ball lighting the \n       nighttime clouds and Jacob's shrieking face.  \n\n       And Jacob falls and falls and falls, his hair sticking \n       straight up from the blasting wind.\n\n       That's when CORPSES start falling past him.  The captain of \n       the plane - the stewardess, her body bent in half - the \n       greyhaired man, his head gone but his book still in his hand.  \n       More men, women, crew people - and CHILDREN.\n\n       But these children aren't dead bodies.  Two LITTLE GIRLS and \n       one LITTLE BOY, all dressed in white, plummet down next to \n       Jacob, head first, like high divers.  And they're singing:\n\n<b>                           THE CHILDREN\n</b>                 One two, Freddy's coming for you...\n\n       The children turn around in the sky so that they are \n       travelling feet first.  The Little Boy's pants puff up and \n       the Girls' skirts poof out and RIP UPWARD - the wind taking \n       away their clothes and their skin and their bodies and their \n       hair...\n\n                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)\n                 Three four, better lock your door...\n\n       Leaving three tiny SKELETONS - taunting and laughing as Jacob \n       screams and covers his eyes.\n\n                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)\n                 Five six, grab your crucifix...\n\n       And the Skeletons sprout wings - leathery and veiny - the \n       wind catching them and sending them up and away as their \n       voices echo in the sky.\n\n                           THE CHILDREN (cont'd)\n                 Seven eight, gonna stay up late...\n\n       Jacob takes his hands away from his face and starts to \n       frantically pull on his seat belt.  SNAP - it flies off his \n       back and miraculously turns into a PARACHUTE.  Rope swirls \n       into the air - the wind grabs the canvas - and Jacob's body \n       slows with a violent jerk.\n\n       But at least he's not falling anymore.  Jacob catches his \n       breath as he starts gently floating through the sky.  He \n       smiles.  This isn't so bad.  This is actually kind of fun.  \n       Not for long, though, because his new upward momentum carries \n       him back up to:\n\n       The winged children's Skeletons.  Jacob's eyes bug out as he \n       rises into them and they start to circle.  They move closer \n       and we can see something in their hands:\n\n<b>       SCISSORS\n</b>\n       Jacob twists his body, trying to steer his parachute away \n       from the demons.  One of the Skeletons swoops up to his face \n       and pokes its scissors inches away from Jacob's eyes.  It \n       sings alone:\n\n<b>                           CHILD\n</b>                 Nine ten, never sleep again!\n\n       The Skeleton cranks its arm back - ready to plunge the \n       scissor's blades into Jacob's sockets.  The arms swings \n       toward him - then suddenly diverts up past his head, heading \n       for:\n\n<b>       THE CHUTE'S STRINGS\n</b>\n       The Skeleton flaps its wings and poises its scissors at one \n       of the ropes.  The other two Skeletons join it over Jacob's \n       head.  The three of them look down at Jacob, their boney jaws \n       in a perpetual smile.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No!\n\n       The Skeletons nod \"yes\".  SNIP - SNIP - SNIP - they cut away \n       at Jacob's parachute as he swings underneath them, trying to \n       pull away - SNIP - SNIP.\n\n       The parachute flutters away - the Skeletons cackle - and \n       Jacob plummets.\n\n<b>       ON JACOB\n</b>\n       We stay with him as he screams and shrieks and yells and the \n       clouds part and the ground rises quickly up to meet him.  The \n       ground becomes a town, the town becomes a block, the block \n       becomes a house, the house becomes a roof, and...\n\n<b>       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n       KA-BLAM!  The ceiling explodes as Jacob's body plows through, \n       slams down, shatters the bed, and we immediately:\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n       Jacob's eyes blast open as he sits up from bed in a cold \n       sweat.  A dream.  The worst fucking dream from hell anyone \n       would ever want to have -- but still just a dream.  He takes \n       a few deep breaths as a soft KNOCK is heard at the door.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Yeah..\n\n       ALICE JOHNSON opens the door and sticks her head in.  She's \n       thirty-two, blonde, with a caring smile.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>                 You okay, honey?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Yeah, Mom.  I'm fine.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>                 Alright.  Better get cooking or you'll be \n                 late for school.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 On my way.\n\n       Alice closes the door as Jacob gets out of bed and stretches.  \n       Sunlight is leaking through the bedroom window shade and \n       Jacob walks over to it.  He reaches out and pulls up the \n       shade.\n\n       And there's nothing buy sky.  Jacob frowns and pokes his head \n       out the window.\n\n<b>       JACOB'S POV - THE GROUND\n</b>\n       is once again racing up towards us at seven-thousand miles an \n       hour.  The entire house is falling.\n\n<b>       BACK IN THE BEDROOM\n</b>\n       Jacob leaps away from the window.  The WINGED SKELETONS \n       reappear outside -- dancing in the air -- cackling with glee.\n\n       The bedroom starts to SHAKE violently as Jacob stumbles into \n       the center.  The roof starts caving in and the walls begins \n       to crumble.\n\n<b>       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON JACOB.\n</b>\n       Jacob grabs his head, looks up at us, and SCREAMS.  We \n       suddenly stay where we are as the house drops down and we \n       punch out through the roof and our shot becomes an:\n\n<b>       ANGLE STRAIGHT DOWN ON THE HOUSE\n</b>\n       as it falls away towards the ground.  We watch as it becomes \n       a small dot - and finally impacts on the surface.  A mushroom \n       cloud of smoke silently puffs out in the distance below\n\n<b>       EXT. TOWN - NIGHT - AT THE CRATER\n</b>\n       Smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth.  \n       Splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant \n       toothpicks.  Some of the toothpicks start to move.\n\n       Jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, \n       battered and, unfortunately, alive.  He climbs up to the edge \n       of the crater.  He looks back a the remnants of his home.\n\n       Then something starts to happen.\n\n       Something his growing from the crater - spreading out.  It's \n       not a cloud, it's not smoke - it's a DARKNESS.  Even though \n       it's night, this darkness is darker.  It creeps out from the \n       hole - fingers of blackness reaching out.  What it covers \n       doesn't disappear.  It becomes GLOOMY.  The shroud is getting \n       bigger.\n\n       And it's getting faster.  Jacob runs.\n\n<b>       WITH JACOB - RUNNING\n</b>\n       He bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic.  \n       He looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its \n       gloominess covering houses.  Then whole blocks.\n\n       Everything it touches seems to fall deeper into SHADOW.\n\n<b>       AT THE STREET CORNER\n</b>\n       Jacob comes across a WOMAN walking her dog.  He stops and \n       yells at her.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Get the hell out of here!  It's coming!\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 What's coming?\n\n       Jacob points down the street.  The shroud is swooping down \n       the road - browning out street lights in its wake.  And the \n       woman doesn't find anything threatening about this.  Jacob \n       screams at her.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Don't you see it?\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 See what?\n\n       And it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything.  The Woman is \n       totally oblivious to the danger.  Jacob shakes his head -- \n       stumbles away.\n\n       The woman watches him go as the darkness PASSES OVER HER.  \n       She sighs.\n\n       And begins to MUTATE.  Her hair gets scraggly, her skin \n       bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump -- all of which \n       she DOESN'T seem to notice.\n\n       She just shrugs her twisted shoulders.\n\n                           WOMAN (cont'd)\n                 Kids...watcha gonna do?\n\n       She hobbles away with her dog - which now has six legs and \n       two heads.\n\n<b>       BACK WITH JACOB - RUNNING\n</b>\n       Like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets \n       passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become \n       passively accepting monsters.\n\n       A VOICE booms out from nowhere.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY (O.S.)\n</b>                 Jacob!  You're too old to run away from \n                 home!\n\n       Jacob covers his ears and races out of town.\n\n<b>       EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n       Jacob falls onto the deserted road just outside of town.  He \n       rolls on the asphalt and looks behind him.  most of the town \n       is covered in an opaque gloom.  \n\n       Suddenly a CACKLING sound is heard and Jacob turns to its \n       source:\n\n<b>       HIS POV: THE SPRINGWOOD SIGN\n</b>\n       The town can still be seen behind it -- the darkness over \n       almost all of it now.  The sign reads: WELCOME TO SPRINGWOOD.  \n<b>       POPULATION...\n</b>\n       And the numbers after the word \"population\" are changing.  \n       They're counting BACKWARDS, clattering away like an old-time \n       gas pump in reverse - faster and faster - blurring as the \n       \"thousands\" digit disappears, then the \"hundreds\", then \n       \"tens\", then...\n\n       CLINK - the count stops at \"1\".  Springwood is entirely \n       engulfed in the shroud.  There is a pause.\n\n       CRASH - the sign is violently YANKED into the ground.  It \n       vanishes into the earth and a CRACK APPEARS at the edge of \n       the road. The crack grows - moving out to the center of the \n       highway.\n\n<b>       BACK ON THE STREET\n</b>\n       Jacob watches the crack as it splits wider in the middle of \n       the street and a GURGLING sound starts to build.  The tar in \n       front of Jacob becomes molten.  It bubbles and pops.\n\n       Jacob scrambles backwards as something begins to rise from \n       boiling asphalt.\n\n       It's a hat.\n\n       The hat, a fedora to be precise, pushes itself up. A left \n       hand - burned and scarred - pokes out next to it.  Four sharp \n       blades jut out of the muck on the other side.  A head is up \n       now - a curtain of tar dripping from the rim of the hat - \n       hiding the face.  The body beneath the head ascends.  The \n       veil of asphalt parts:\n\n       It's FREDDY KRUEGER.  Jacob SCREAMS.\n\n       Freddy LAUGHS.  He shakes off his layer of tar and looks \n       towards the clouded town of Springwood.  A look of pure \n       hatred appears on his ragged face.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Payback time...\n\n       Freddy opens his mouth - lets out a large breath - and then \n       INHALES an even larger one.\n\n       A WINDSTORM starts, the source being Krueger's own lungs.  \n       The gale force begins to yank at the shroud surrounding \n       Springwood.  Fingers of darkness pull up from the town and \n       towards Freddy's mouth -- and houses begin to DISSOLVE.  \n       Freddy continues to inhale like he's never going to stop.\n\n       Krueger is sucking the black gloom into his body - and the \n       entire town of Springwood is going with it.  Trees, \n       buildings, cars, picket fences.  It's all crumbling and \n       fusing, becoming a part of t cloud that itself is caught in \n       the nightmarish wind tunnel, all piling into Freddy's mouth.\n\n       The vortex swirls into Krueger.  Then it's gone.  Nothing but \n       a vacant lot the size of a town remains.  Freddy turns to \n       Jacob and BURPS, it sounds like a THUNDERCLAP.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No!\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Don't worry, I have a strong stomach.\n\n       Freddy reaches down and yanks up his red and green sweater.  \n       He pulls apart his putrid abdomen to reveal his guts - and a \n       transparent stomach.\n\n       Inside the stomach: a black swirling mass.  Flashes of \n       houses, people, homes, couples, all trapped in horrible \n       anguish.  Freddy drops down his sweater.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Springwood is mine, boy!\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I dreamed you away before I was born!  \n                 Mom said you couldn't come back!\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Is that true?  Then she told you all \n                 about me, huh? Let's see what else she \n                 has to say.\n\n       Freddy reaches his left hand into the bubbling tar at his \n       feet, digs around a bit, then pulls out:\n\n       ALICE.  Jacob's mother.  Tar dripping down her body.  Krueger \n       has her by the neck, waves his blades in front of her.  Jacob \n       gets up and runs toward him.\n\n       Freddy pulls a foot up from the asphalt pit and KICKS Jacob \n       back a good fifteen feet.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>                 Run, Jacob!\n\n       The boy rolls painful on the hard road.  He sits up and \n       screams:\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Leave her alone!\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 You're such a momma's boy!\n\n       Freddy swings his knives out, pauses for a terrifying beat, \n       then swoops the daggers towards Alice.\n\n<b>       CLOSE ON JACOB\n</b>\n       as OFF SCREEN we hear a horrible multiple GLITCH!  Jacob \n       shrieks in gut-wrenching anguish.\n\n<b>       WIDE ON SCENE\n</b>\n       We're far enough away so that we don't barf at the sight but \n       close enough to see that Freddy has impaled Alice's body on \n       his blades.  He lifts her up effortlessly and raises her limp \n       figure RIGHT OVER HIS HEAD.\n\n       Krueger swings his arm out, shaking off Alice, sending her \n       flying over Jacob's head.  The body lands behind him.\n\n<b>       ON JACOB\n</b>\n       as he runs to his mother.  She VANISHES just as he reaches \n       out to touch her bloody body.  He turns to Krueger and raises \n       his fists.  A look of sheer rage is growing in him, blind, \n       insane anger.  He bellows:\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 You fucker!\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Springwood is only the beginning.  All I \n                 need from you is a ride!\n\n       Suddenly, between Jacob and Freddy, three SHAFTS OF LIGHT \n       burst up from the road.  Three FIGURES appear as the light \n       dissipates.\n\n       They're dressed in metallic black, heavy boots, helmets with \n       dark visors covering their faces.  One is large and muscular.  \n       The one in the center has an obviously feminine figure under \n       her skin-tight outfit.  The third is a little smaller than \n       the other two with a slightly different face  that allows us \n       to see his mouth.\n\n       They're the DREAM POLICE.  Jacob doesn't know this yet, but \n       Freddy seems to.  The bastard son of a hundred maniacs frowns \n       at the sight of these new apparitions.\n\n       Then he looks past them and smiles at Jacob.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 See ya later!\n\n       Freddy violently DROPS down into the bubbling asphalt pit.  \n       Two of the black figures start after him.  The third one \n       turns to Jacob as his partners leap into the hole after \n       Freddy.  The sound from his exposed mouth is DEAFENING!\n\n<b>                           SOUND COP\n</b><b>                 WAKE UP!\n</b>\n       Jacob grabs his ears in pain as we suddenly:\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n</b>\n       Jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash.  \n       He's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal \n       position.  Jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up.  He \n       shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead - and that's when he \n       notices something in his hand.\n\n<b>       INSERT: JACOB'S HAND\n</b>\n       it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in \n       the middle, like an ID band.  Jacob's fingers turn the plate \n       over. Printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's \n       former owner: ALICE.  Jacob has a souvenir.\n\n<b>       BACK TO JACOB\n</b>\n       He raises his face and looks at the road in front of him.  It \n       goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty \n       fields. \n\n       This is where Springwood used to be.  A look of anguish \n       crosses Jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Mom...\n\n<b>       HONK!  SCREECH!\n</b>\n       Jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van \n       blasting right at him.  He rolls off to the side of the road.  \n       The truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in \n       its wake.\n\n       Jacob chokes on the dust.  He slowly recovers and looks back \n       down at the bracelet in his hand. He clenches his fist around \n       it as a wild-eyed angry look starts to grow on him.  He takes \n       a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks OUT OF FRAME.\n\n<b>       ANGLE DOWN THE HIGHWAY\n</b>\n       We can see a pickup truck in the distance. Jacob's HAND \n       ENTERS FRAME, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet \n       dangling from his wrist.\n\n       The pickup truck starts to slow down.\n\n<b>       EXT. ROSEDALE - DAY\n</b>\n       A sprawling little community with pleasant streets and \n       cheerful houses.  It looks a lot like Springwood, the only \n       real difference being that it actually exists.  It also has a \n       sign: WELCOME TO ROSEDALE.  POPULATION: 8,786\n\n       A Volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of \n       blocks down the road from us.  Jacob steps out of the \n       passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye.  He \n       shuffles into town.\n\n<b>       CLOSE ON YET ANOTHER SIGN\n</b>\n       It reads: DRUG ADDICTS NOT WELCOME TO ROSEDALE!\n\n       The sign pulls away to reveal a middle-aged man with an angry \n       expression: MR. HOPKINS\n\n<b>                           MR. HOPKINS\n</b>                 Clean up your act somewhere else!\n\n       He walks along as we PULL BACK TO SEE\n\n<b>       EXT. ROSEDALE FOSTER HOME - DAY\n</b>\n       It's a nice-looking two-story house in the middle of a \n       usually quiet neighborhood.  Today the home is surrounded by \n       about a dozen townsfolk carrying picket signs: NO HALFWAY \n<b>       HOUSES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD!, DON'T LOWER OUR PROPERTY \n</b>       VALUES!, and GO BACK TO JUVENILE HALL!  The crowd mumbles \n       amongst itself, occasionally bursting out with a chant in \n       protest.\n\n<b>       ON JACOB\n</b>\n       We catch him walking down the sidewalk.  He tramps along with \n       his hands stuffed in his pockets and his eyes on the \n       pavement.  He looks like he hasn't slept in days.  The sound \n       of the crowd ahead of him finally grabs his attention.\n\n       Jacob approaches the disturbance and comes across a young \n       girl standing behind a bush holding a BAG OF GROCERIES.  She \n       is KAREN MILLER, dark hair, sixteen, very pretty, but with a \n       faraway look in her eyes.\n\n       Jacob stands next to her and stares at the crowd like a \n       zombie.  She doesn't turn to look at him as he speaks:\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 What's going on?\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Free speech.

For \n                 teenagers.  It's where you go when things \n                 get bad.  It's the place to figure out \n                 what to do next.  It's a home for kids \n                 that no one else wants.\n                     (beat)\n                 It's MY home.\n\n       Karen hasn't looked at Jacob once.  She suddenly seems to \n       steel herself and walks away from the bush, towards the \n       house.  Jacob is befuddled.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Oh...\n\n       He stands there and watches.\n\n<b>       IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE\n</b>\n       Karen quickly makes her way into the crowd of people, head \n       up, eyes staring forward.  The crowd parts ever so slightly \n       as the irked townsfolk start to heat up.  They have an actual \n       human to vent their anger on now.  Mr. Hopkins lays in on her \n       as she passes him.\n\n<b>                           MR. HOPKINS\n</b>                 Why can't you find somewhere else to \n                 shack up?\n\n       Karen turns to him, still walking, flustered and hurt.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 What have we ever done to you?\n\n<b>                           MR. HOPKINS\n</b>                 Nothing...YET.\n\n       Karen turns quickly away from him and trips over a sprinkler \n       head.  Her groceries tumble onto the grass.  A hand reaches \n       down to help her.  It's Jacob's.\n\n       He quietly helps her re-bag her groceries as Mr. Hopkins \n       looms above them.  Both angry and embarrassed now.\n\n                           MR. HOPKINS (cont'd)\n                 Look, we've been here for years.  This is \n                 a quiet street.  We'd just like to keep \n                 it that way.\n\n       Jacob can't take this guy anymore.  He stands up and faces \n       the older man with a scowl.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Lighten up, mister.\n\n<b>                           MR.

He just huffs \n       and puffs as Karen grabs Jacob and pulls him up to the front \n       porch of the home, then into the floor.\n\n<b>       INT.

Karen looks concerned.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Are YOU okay?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Yeah.

Karen gives Jacob a huge grin.\n\n<b>       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n       Karen leads Jacob into the room.  There are two teenagers on \n       the couch: WESLEY is a fifteen-year old, curly hair, kind of \n       small.  GINA is also fifteen, brunette hair, seems pretty \n       happy.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Hey, guys, I got someone for you to meet.  \n                 This is Jacob.

How'd you get through the \n                 blockade?\n\n       Another kid, SCOTT, pops into the room.  He's sixteen, dark \n       hair, with a tough-guy I could give a shit attitude.  He \n       doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for \n       Karen.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 Hey, beautiful.

Karen is a little annoyed.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 Who's Barney Rubble?\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 This is Jacob Johnson.

I could use the company.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 So what's your story?  Divorce?  Custody \n                 battle?

As he lights one up, Wesley's cheerful attitude \n       suddenly turns grim.  He gets up from the couch and quickly \n       leaves the room.  Karen gives Scott an angry look.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Is he alright?\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 He'll be fine.

These two are not going to get \n       along very well.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Just what is YOUR problem, then?\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 I took care of my problem.  That's why \n                 I'M here.\n\n       Scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves.  Jacob \n       gives Karen a confused glance.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 His dad used to beat him.  One day he \n                 couldn't take it any more.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 What happened?\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 He killed him with his father's gun.  \n                 Self-defense.\n\n       Jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in.  Gina \n       scootches away from him on the couch, then gives him a glum \n       look.\n\n<b>                           GINA\n</b>                 Everyone here has a fun tale to tell.  \n                 Isn't that right, Karen?\n\n       Karen is staring out the window.  She has that spaced-out \n       expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Yeah.  Right.\n\n       No one has anything left to say.  Gina turns the sound on the \n       TV back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons.\n\n<b>       INT. FOSTER HOME - THE TV ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n       Jacob is alone in the dark watching some kind of NICK AT \n       NIGHT b&amp;w sit-com re-run.  A cheerful family lovingly banters \n       away on the flickering tube.  Jacob just stares blankly.\n\n       Karen sleepily shows up at the doorway in a long tee-shirt \n       with a glass of milk.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Why don't you go to bed?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I can't sleep.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 You need to talk?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No.  I'm fine.  Thanks.\n\n       Karen gives him a worried look and heads off to bed.  Jacob \n       continues watching TV with a creepy glean in his tired eyes.\n\n<b>       INT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n       The kids are here cleaning up the building.  The guys throw \n       rotted lumber into trash bins while the girls sweep up.  We \n       catch Jacob and Scott tossing some debris into a wheelbarrow.  \n       Jacob looks pretty ragged.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 Come on.  Let's hop to it.

Okay, this load's full.\n\n       Jacob grabs the handles of the wheelbarrow and shakily picks \n       it up.  Scott sneers.\n\n                           SCOTT (cont'd)\n                 You got that?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Yeah, no problem.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 I don't know.  Maybe you should think \n                 about switching to de-caf or something.\n\n       Jacob ignores him and pushes the wheelbarrow along.  Scott \n       takes some time off to smoke a cigarette.  He spots Karen \n       across the room bending over with a dustbin.  Scott lingers \n       on this view for a long time.\n\n<b>       AT A DUMPSTER\n</b>\n       Jacob pulls up with the wheelbarrow and starts to unload the \n       junk.  Gina is next to the dumpster sweeping.  She tries to \n       push a large crate aside by herself, but slips and falls.\n\n       Jacob jumps over to her, reaches out, and grabs her arm to \n       help her up.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 You okay?\n\n       Gina SCREAMS.\n\n<b>                           GINA\n</b>                 No!  Yes!  Let go of me!\n\n       She shakes off his grip and he jumps back.  She runs away \n       with a wild look in her eyes as Karen steps up to a confused \n       Jacob.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 She doesn't like to be touched.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No shit!\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Don't take it personally.

A twisted rusty sign post erupts out of the sidewalk \n       and settles at an ugly angle.\n\n       It's an ELM ST. sign.\n\n<b>       INT.

Outside the window there is only darkness.  \n       Jacob twists and struggles on the stretcher as\n\n       CLANG! the ambulance doors crash open revealing BLACKNESS and \n       KA-BOOM!  the stretcher is shot out of the van like a \n       cannonball.\n\n<b>       INT.

The straps around Jacob \n       drop away as his body falls to the floor.  He scrambles to \n       his feet and starts to RUN.\n\n       Freddy laughs\n\n<b>       WITH JACOB - RUNNING\n</b>\n       as he heads for a door.

And three \n       FLASHES OF LIGHT blast out behind the boy.  Jacob rolls away \n       as Freddy holds up an arm to block the blinding glare.  The \n       light fades.  The DREAM POLICE have arrived.\n\n       We'll call the small one SOUND COP.  He stands there \n       motionless as a loud and horrible GROWING noise emanates from \n       his clenched teeth.  This guy's bark is worse than his bite.\n\n       The female in black is BLADE COP.  From nowhere she produces \n       two nasty-looking knives, one in each hand.  She spins the \n       blades in the air like an expert Samurai.\n\n       The large one we'll call POWER COP.  He reaches out for the \n       dumpster, and with one hand sends it tumbling away with a \n       CRASH.  Freddy frowns.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Uh oh. Too many parking tickets.\n\n       The Dream Police fan out around Krueger, surrounding him.  \n       Power Cop leaps at Freddy, grabs him and TOSSES him in the \n       air.  Freddy tumbles, rolls and bounces right back up on his \n       feet.  Right next to BLADE.\n\n       She swings her knives.  Freddy dodges.  Swings hi own blades \n       at her.  She ducks.  Freddy spins again.  Right towards:\n\n       SOUND COP.  The short man in black opens his mouth and a \n       sound like a foghorn at a rock concert BLARES OUT.  The force \n       of it hitting Freddy like a fist.\n\n       Freddy bounces back.  And once again he nimbly pops up.  He \n       glares at the Dream Police.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Don't interfere!\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 We have to.\n\n<b>                           SOUND COP\n</b>                 It's our job.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Get a new one.\n\n       And Freddy starts to SPIN.  Slowly at first, then faster and \n       faster, until his image starts to BLUR.\n\n       The Police circle the whirling image, holding back to see \n       what will happen next.  Krueger stops spinning.  And his \n       clothes are different.  His red and green stripes have been \n       replaced by black and white ones.  There is a number printed \n       across his chest.  He's dressed like a CONVICT.  Freddy \n       grins.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Time to blow this joint.\n\n       BOOM!  A hole is suddenly blown in the high ceiling above \n       Krueger.  The building is suddenly filled with the beams of \n       moving SPOTLIGHTS and the sound of blasting SIRENS.\n\n       A rope falls down through the hole.  Freddy grabs it and \n       WHOOSH! he's yanked up.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 You'll never get me, coppers!\n\n       and away he's gone.  After a few seconds the spotlights fade \n       away and the sirens die.  The Dream Police look up seemingly \n       unsure of their next action.  Then Power Cop kicks a pile of \n       lumber, sending wood flying dozens of yards away.\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 Goddamnit!\n\n       Sound Cop shakes his head.  Blade looks frustrated.  Jacob \n       steps up behind them.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Alright...just who the hell are you guys?\n\n       The black-clad trio turn around in unison and look at Jacob.  \n       There is a pause.  Then:\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 We're the Dream Police.\n\n       Jacob almost laughs.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 The what?\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 The Dream Police.  Didn't you hear her, \n                 man?\n\n       Power Cop turns to Sound Cop and flips up his visor revealing \n       his face.  He's a sixteen-year old black boy.  Heavyset \n       features, sweat dripping down his cheeks.  He's KINCAID from \n       NIGHTMARE 3.  And he's pissed.\n\n                           POWER COP (cont'd)\n                 We try and save this guy's ass and then \n                 he goes off and cops an attitude.\n\n       Sound Cop flips up his helmet.  He's JOEY, the former mute \n       boy.\n\n<b>                           SOUND COP\n</b>                 I think you're the wrong guy to talk \n                 about attitudes.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 Guys, guys.

These three, \n       they're the Dream Warriors.  Or at least they used to be. \n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Hello?

(He bears a \n       suspicious resemblance to ROBERT ENGLUND.)\n\n<b>       WESLEY\n</b>\n       vaguely tenses at this and absently pulls the blanket more \n       tightly around him to compensate, like a cocoon.\n\n<b>       ON THE TV\n</b>\n       The second orderly smiles.\n\n<b>                           SECOND ORDERLY\n</b>                 Yeah, mac.  You've just had a hard day, \n                 that's all.\n\n       The orderly produces a pack of matches.  He goes to the \n       lunatic on the cot, and LIGHTS the match off the guy's \n       forehead.  As the match FLARES, the lunatic SCREAMS.\n\n<b>       CLOSE ON WESLEY\n</b>\n       he shuts his eyes tensely as the SOUND is magnified, becoming \n       a sudden ROAR that fills the room.\n\n       Wesley blinks his eyes open, looks around from his blanket \n       cocoon.  Whatever that last sound was, it did NOT come from \n       the TV.\n\n       Beads of sweat line his upper lip as he nervously glances \n       about the room.  It remains quiet, serene.  Deciding it was \n       his imagination reacting to the scene on TV, Wesley nestles \n       back on the couch, laying down now as the CAMERA MOVES TO \n<b>       REVEAL\n</b>\n       The carpet at the edge of the room is bunched up as though \n       the walls of the room itself have budged a few inches inward.\n\n       BACK ON THE TV the second orderly lights his cigarette as he \n       hands the pack to the first.  They both look down at the \n       madman as they savor their cigarettes.  \n\n<b>                           ORDERLY ON TV\n</b>                 You heard the man, Wesley.

Then he \n       stiffens as the two orderlies in the movie begin to hold the \n       lit cigarettes over the lunatic's face\n\n<b>                           SECOND ORDERLY\n</b>                 Yeah, Wesley.

The white blanket around him \n       restraining him tightly like the straight-jacket on TV.  He \n       squirms and struggles.\n\n                           WESLEY (cont'd)\n                 Hey.\n\n       He struggles harder now, but to no avail.  He's wrapped \n       tight, like a cigarette.\n\n       ON THE TV the two orderlies torment the straight-jacketed \n       lunatic, poking his face with their lit cigarettes.  As the \n       lunatic SCREAMS, the screams become magnified, again becoming \n       that loud, deafening ROAR we heard before.  Wesley squirms in \n       his blanket/ straight-jacket, he jerks his head around, \n       SEEING with each of the man's SCREAMS, the walls of the room \n       SHUDDER INWARD and \n\n       Wesley's EYES WIDEN with horror as he realizes not only is he \n       TRAPPED like a sardine in his stark white blanket, but the \n       walls of the room are starting to CLOSE IN on him.  He SPINS \n       back to the TV set, where:\n\n       The first orderly is now looking AT US.

Just have a smoke on us!\n\n       As they hold their smokes out TOWARD US, their arms PROTRUDE \n       FROM THE TV SET with their lit cigarettes.\n\n       Wesley SCREAMS and jerks his head away from TV and he HITS \n       the floor with an ugly THUMP.  The wind knocked out of him.  \n       He rolls.  The couch is GONE.\n\n       As he squirms and struggles to escape his white cocoon, the \n       frightened boy looks around and sees that everything in the \n       room - furniture, carpet, TV, even the door - are all gone, \n       leaving just the white walls SLOWLY CLOSING IN ON HIM.\n\n       Then we see that on the floor all around Wesley are long, \n       cylindrical white objects.  Clearly, they resemble GIANT \n       CIGARETTES, and Wesley - wrapped neck-to-toe in his white \n       blanket cocoon - looks just like one of them.\n\n       He continues to squirm and SCREAM as the walls CLOSE IN from \n       all sides -- closer -- CLOSER -- pushing the long white \n       things toward him, around him, bunching them together until \n       they are in a tight cluster, as the room CRUNCHES IN TIGHTLY, \n       blocking whatever light source there is, until all Wesley can \n       do is SCREAM one last time, and\n\n       The screen goes BLACK.\n\n       After a few beats, we hear a huge, deafening RIPPING SOUND, \n       and a new LIGHT SOURCE appears as  Wesley looks up, eyes wide \n       with unspeakable horror as the giant, scarred face of FREDDY \n       looms over him, grinning, and we:\n\n<b>       INT.

THEY don't even know how they got \n                 there.  But they're somehow patrolling \n                 dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 Then why haven't these guys done the job \n                 already?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 They say they need help.

Come \n                 on.  Let's go inside.\n\n       She stands up.\n\n<b>       INT. KAREN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n       Jacob and Karen lie in bed, clothes on, cozy.  Not sexual.  \n       She stares at the ceiling while he listens.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 She was great. Loving.  Supportive, \n                 caring - everything a mom should be. \n                 Except she had one fatal flow: my father.  \n                 You see, she was raised at a time when \n                 they still had the \"obey\" part in the \n                 wedding vows.  He was always jealous.  \n                 She couldn't talk to another man without \n                 him thinking she wanted to go to bed with \n                 him.  He never hit me. But the things he \n                 did to her...and she would always just \n                 take it.  She never fought back.  He'd \n                 get drunk and...she'd tell people she \n                 just fell down or something.  Then one \n                 night...I was thirteen.  Something \n                 happened.  My mom suddenly wouldn't take \n                 it anymore.  Something made her say \n                 enough is enough.  She hit back.  Tat \n                 only made it worse.  I watched as he hit \n                 her over and over.  Then he knocked her \n                 down the stairs.  She broke her neck.  \n                 And when y father saw what he'd done - he \n                 finally became human.  He cried over her \n                 body for a while, then went into the \n                 garage and blew his brains out with a \n                 shotgun.  To this day I don't remember \n                 what that final straw was.  The shrinks \n                 say I've blocked it out of my memory.  \n                 There's no one else alive who knows what \n                 really happened.  I have dreams about it \n                 sometimes, but there's always that blank \n                 spot.  A missing piece.\n\n       She stops and closes her eyes.  Jacob closes his eyes for a \n       second also - feeling her pain.\n\n<b>       DIFFERENT ANGLE\n</b>\n       Jacob opens his eyes and touches Karen's arm.  She finally \n       turns to him.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I'm sorry.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 I know nightmares are real, Jacob.

I inherited some \n                 from her - and some I have all to myself.  \n                 She showed me how I could link up with \n                 other people's dreams - to actually be \n                 inside with them.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 That sounds wonderful.

We're doing it now.\n\n       Jacob smiles, gets up and walks over to the bedroom door.  \n       Karen is confused.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 What do you mean?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I mean we're dreaming.  You and me.  \n                 Together.\n\n       He opens the bedroom door.  And there's a FOREST OUTSIDE.  \n       Karen is a little scared at first, totally blown away by \n       what's happening.  But then she stands up and smiles.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Want to go for a walk?\n\n       Karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway \n       into daylight.\n\n<b>       EXT. FOREST - DAY\n</b>\n       Shafts of sunlight filter through as leaves flutter down from \n       the towering trees and Jacob and Karen step out of the \n       bedroom door.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 I don't believe it.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 It's true.

Then she giggles.  She likes this a lot.  \n       Karen suddenly runs away into the trees like an excited \n       little girl.  Jacob frowns.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Karen.  Wait.\n\n       He heads off after her.\n\n<b>       AMONGST THE TREES\n</b>\n       Jacob runs.  Karen jumps out from behind a tree and laughs.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 You have to be careful.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Did you bring us here on purpose?

Jacob follows her.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd)\n                 You know what I like to do in my dreams?\n\n       She ducks behind a tree.  And comes out suddenly dressed as a \n       sharp BUSINESSWOMAN.  Jacob is slightly taken aback.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd)\n                 I like to be other people!\n\n       Jacob grins as she steps behind another tree - and a FIREMAN \n       walks out in her place.  Jacob is really taken aback this \n       time.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd) (as fireman)\n                 I can be anybody I want.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Show off.\n\n       Karen slips past another trunk and comes out as a tall \n<b>       VOLUPTUOUS REDHEAD.\n</b>\n<b>                           KAREN (AS REDHEAD)\n</b>                 When things get bad it helps to be \n                 someone else.  I use it to protect \n                 myself.  \n\n       The redhead walks seductively towards Jacob.  He raises his \n       eyebrows as she slinks right up next to him - her ample \n       cleavage inches away from his nose.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd) (as redhead)\n                 What do you think?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I think I like you the way you always \n                 are.\n\n       He smiles.\n\n<b>       DIFFERENT ANGLE\n</b>\n       And now Karen is herself again.

It's not the \n       one to the bedroom.  It just hangs there in space between two \n       trees.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd)\n                 I wonder where it goes?\n\n       She reaches for the knob and opens it.  \n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Karen, no!\n\n       But she's already stepped through.  Jacob runs up to the \n       doorway and it SLAMS in his face.  Jacob tries to open the \n       door.  It doesn't budge.  He keeps twisting the knob to no \n       effect.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Karen!\n\n       Jacob starts to pound on the door as we:\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       INT. KAREN'S HOME - KITCHEN\n</b>\n       Sixties style decore, appliances that look about twenty-five \n       years old -- not the Foster Home kitchen at all.  Karen is \n       standing in the middle of the room, completely disoriented.  \n       She walks across to a counter top where she finds a framed \n       picture.\n\n       It's a picture of HER, Karen, age thirteen.  Karen sets the \n       picture down and quickly walks back to the door she came in.\n\n<b>       INT. KAREN'S HOME - LOWER HALLWAY\n</b>\n       Karen steps out of her old kitchen expecting, hoping to be \n       back in the forest again.  Nope.  She blinks.  Then she \n       starts to walk down the corridor. \n\n       More pictures on the wall this time.  One of a WOMAN and \n       another of a MAN (Karen's MOM and DAD).\n\n       Karen's sure of it now.  She's home.  The center of her worst \n       nightmares.  She creeps along to the main stairs.  And that's \n       when the NOISES begin.  A thumping from upstairs.  A CRASH, \n       like something hit the floor above.  More thumping, \n       repeatedly and then human MOANING, the sound of pain.\n\n       Somebody is getting beaten.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Oh no...\n\n       Something is twisting deep inside the girl.  Her face goes \n       shallow as she slowly shuffles around to the foot of the \n       stairs...and starts to climb them.\n\n<b>       ON THE STAIRS\n</b>\n       Karen goes up, step by painful step, as the sounds of the \n       BEATING increase in their intensity.  Every hit seems to \n       touch Karen as she flinches.  She's afraid to go on - but \n       can't seem to stop.\n\n<b>       INT. KAREN'S HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n</b>\n       Karen slowly heads for a door at the end, nervously reaches \n       out for the knob.\n\n<b>       INT. KAREN'S PARENT'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n       Karen opens the door.  What she thought she was going to see \n       was bad enough - but this is worse:\n\n       Freddy Krueger is in the middle of the room.  In front of him \n       is a giant human-sized version of an inflatable punching \n       doll, the kind little kids hit that keep bouncing back.  But \n       the doll doesn't have the image of a clown on it.\n\n       It's a flattened wrapped-around version of KAREN'S MOTHER, a \n       pitiful beat-up look on her plastic face.  \n\n       Freddy SMACKS the doll - it falls to the floor - and just \n       bounces back up.  And now the face on it has a NEW BRUISE.\n\n       THWACK!  He hits it again, CACKLING with glee.  Swoop, \n       bounce.  More bruises develop.  Krueger looks at Karen.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Welcome to Romper Room!\n\n       BAP!  BOOOOING!  The face on the punching doll changes again, \n       it's even sadder now.

Krueger whips up his finger knives.  SWOOP!  he RIPS \n       them through the plastic doll.  SISSSSSssss.  The doll starts \n       to deflate.  SKREEEEeeeee.  The escaping air sounding like a \n       human SCREAM.  Freddy turns to Karen.\n\n       And a HAND reaches out from behind her and pulls her out of \n       the room.\n\n<b>       INT.

There \n       are now NO DOORS and NO STAIRWAY.  The only way out is the \n       bedroom door they just closed.

She is confused and disoriented.  A \n       CRASH is heard at the bedroom door.  FREDDY'S COMING.\n\n       And Jacob HITS Karen.  Nothing major.  It's a good slap, \n       nonetheless.  She stares at him unbelievingly.

She doesn't know what she's \n       supposed to do.  KA-BLAM!  Freddy blasts through the door in \n       a shower of splinters.  He sees them and grins.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Gettin' kinky, huh?\n\n       Jacob turns to Karen, raises his hand.  KA-BLAM!  Something \n       blasts through the wall across from them.  It's POWER COP.\n\n       CRASH!  The other wall explodes.  BLADE appears in the \n       rubble.\n\n       BOOM!  A piece of wall falls down at the end of the corridor.  \n       SOUND COP steps through.\n\n       Karen looks at all this nonsense, then at Jacob.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 I think I get it now.\n\n       She closes her eyes and DISAPPEARS out of Jacob's hands.  The \n       DREAM POLICE stand in the hallway.  Freddy just puts his \n       hands on his hips and LAUGHS at them.\n\n       Then Krueger lays his arms flat on his sides, takes a deep \n       breath and begins to INFLATE.  His body expands, his clothes \n       and skin stretch and flatten.  The bottom half of him getting \n       fatter.\n\n       He turns into a giant FREDDY PUNCHING DOLL.\n\n       Power Cop jumps in front of the plastic horror and lets loose \n       a devastating swing.

The big Dream Cop pummels away at the \n       Krueger toy as it slaps back and forth between the floor and \n       his fist until SHINK!  Two knives appear in Blade's hands and \n       SWOOP.  She swings them out.\n\n       RIP!  The Freddy Doll tears, air blasting out in a grating \n       SHRIEK which screeches and hisses until it becomes:\n\n       Freddy's LAUGH.

She holds a deck \n       of cards in one hand while she plays solitaire on her bed \n       sheets.\n\n       She flips a card from her deck: A black nine.  She puts it on \n       top of a ten.  Another card.  Queen of diamonds.  She lays it \n       on top of a king of clubs.  Gina yawns.  Takes another card.\n\n       It's the Freddy of Spades.\n\n       Gina frowns.  Freddy Krueger's image stares up at her from \n       the card.  She looks at her stacks.  There's no place to put \n       this one.  She starts flipping through the deck of cards, \n       trying to see if there are any more Freddys.  That's when a \n       HAND RIPS UP through the bed and grabs her arm.  \n\n       Gina SCREAMS, pulls away from the hand's grip and jumps back \n       up on the bed.  And ANOTHER HAND shoots up from a pillow and \n       grabs her shoulder.  Gina twists.\n\n       RIP.  TEAR.  GRAB.  More hands appear out of the mattress, \n       lunging for any part of Gina's body as she SHRIEKS from their \n       touch.  And Gina jumps out of bed.\n\n       She leaps to the other side of the room, bumping against her \n       dresser drawers.  Turns to her bed.\n\n       SWOOP.  The multiple hands disappear down into the mattress.  \n       There is a quiet beat as she catches her shivering breath.\n\n       Then a half-dozen ARMS AND HANDS pop out from the drawers \n       next to her.  Latching indiscriminately.  Some grabbing her \n       legs and arms.  Some grabbing more intimate parts.\n\n       Gina SCREAMS.  Pulls away from the dresser.  Yanks a few \n       drawers out as the hands vanish and she spins over to another \n       wall.\n\n       Where the wall ERUPTS with outreaching arms all around her.  \n       Two grab her hair.  Three on each arm.  Her legs are pinned.  \n       Gina shrieks and yells and flays her arms.  Beating the hands \n       with her fists as two grabs her breasts viciously.  She \n       starts kicking as one particularly perverse hand BURNT AND \n       SCARRED, pops out between her legs.  Aiming right for her \n       crotch and in an incredible show of strength, the girl pulls \n       away from the horde.\n\n       Gina heads for the door.  CRASH.  Hands blast up from the \n       wood floor.  She leaps around them.  CRASH.  More hands try \n       to block her way.\n\n       Gina jumps around like she's in a mine field made of hot \n       coals.  She finally reaches to door and flings it open.\n\n<b>       INT.

Overpopulation.\n\n       The elevator stops.  The doors begin to open.  Gina leaps for \n       the way out.  But she's blocked.\n\n       Blocked by PEOPLE.  They fill the entrance to the lift and \n       start to pile in.  All kinds of people: businessmen, nurses, \n       plumbers.  And they're all ZOMBIES.\n\n       Vacant expressions fill their dark hollow eyes as the zombies \n       keep coming in.  Pushing Gina back into the elevator.  \n       Filling it to capacity and beyond.\n\n       The doors close and the elevator starts to move up.  Twenty \n       bodies are crammed into the tiny enclosure, smashed together, \n       surrounding the poor teenager, drool oozing out of their \n       mouths, breathing down her neck.  SMASHING her so hard she \n       can't even yell for help.  Gina turns her head.\n\n       WESLEY is pressed up next to her.  A very dead look on his \n       face.  Begin squeezed by the zombies around him.  One of his \n       eyes POPS out of its socket.\n\n       Gina finds the breath to scream and scream and scream.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Eight floor - the morgue.  \n\n       The elevator doors open and the mass of zombies starts to \n       spastically pile out.  Gina, having only been held up by the \n       crushing bodies, falls to her knees as the last of the \n       monsters exit the lift.  She breathes in ripping gasps like \n       she's having a coronary.  But she sees the open door.  And \n       Gina jumps for the exit.\n\n       Freddy grabs her shoulder and pulls her back violently.  Gina \n       falls to the floor again as the doors shut.  Freddy waves his \n       fingers down the row of buttons and stops above the very \n       bottom one.  This button doesn't looks like the others.  \n\n       It's in the shape of a little heart.\n\n       Freddy turns and gives Gina a frighteningly serious look.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Time to go down, Gina.\n\n       He presses the heart button.  And the floor disappears.  Gina \n       falls SCREAMING into blackness as Freddy hangs in mid-air and \n<b>       LAUGHS.  \n</b>\n<b>       INT.

Gina's \n       body drops down, unexpectedly softly, landing on the fluffy \n       satin sheets.\n\n       she's dressed in a skimpy piece of bright pink LINGERIE.  She \n       moans and tries to sit up.\n\n       And four snake-like strips of satin swoop out from under the \n       bed and quickly wrap around each of her limbs, pulling her \n       down and yank her tight.\n\n       She's trapped.  That's when the door to the room opens and in \n       walks an incredibly huge FAT MAN.  He barely fits through the \n       door as he closes it behind him.  Puffy cheeks, permanent \n       seat, dirty fingernails, and a lecherous smile.\n\n       Gina's eyes widen.\n\n<b>                           FAT MAN\n</b>                 Hi there, princess.

On the other side is a dinner cart \n       and a waiter behind it.  The waiter is JACOB.\n\n       CRASH!  Jacob shoves the dinner cart into the room and into \n       Freddy's gut, shoving Krueger across the room into a tumbled \n       heap.  Three EXPLOSIONS OF LIGHT BURST into the room.  The \n       Dream Police materialize.\n\n       Freddy jumps up growling.  Power Cop grabs him from behind.  \n       Blade leaps over to the bed and in a FLASH of steel, releases \n       Gina from her satin bonds.  Jacob yanks Gina off the bed and \n       pulls her towards the door.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Come on!\n\n       Freddy jumps out of Power Cop's grip and the Dream Police \n       surround him as the two teenagers bolt out of the room.\n\n<b>       INT.

Karen \n       turns her head to look.\n\n       A craggy OLD WOMAN is rocking back and forth on her front \n       porch.  She's eating something, something stringy and slimy.  \n       She munches away with a vacant look in her eyes.\n\n       The something in her hands MOVES slightly.  The old woman's \n       meal is still alive.\n\n       Karen gags and walks faster.  And a PANTING sound is heard, \n       like two dogs.  Someone is walking their pet down the \n       sidewalk.  \n\n       It's the MUTANT WOMAN from Jacob's opening nightmare: \n       straggly hair, oozing sores, limping.  The source of the \n       multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it.\n\n       The mutant woman waves unpleasantly at Karen.

Rats and tarantula \n       spiders skitter about.  Jacob grits his teeth and walks in \n       deeper.\n\n<b>       EXT. SPRINGWOOD TAVERN\n</b>\n       Scott BLASTS out of the asphalt.

Muffled MUSIC and VOICES seep through the \n       cracks of the double doors. \n\n       Scott looks around, then shrugs.  He heads for the entrance.\n\n<b>       INT.

It wouldn't even come close to \n       the patrons of this joint.\n\n       They dance, they yell, they drink bloody bubbling mixtures.  \n       There's a guy to the right that doesn't seem to mind that \n       half his brain is showing.  That girl over there has no jaw.  \n       In a booth is a couple that are connected at the lips.  A \n       ventriloquist on stage is entertaining the troops with his \n       hand up the back of a real body.\n\n       Scott steps through the door and blinks about a dozen times. \n       Then he decides that the smart course of action is to turn \n       around and go right back out.\n\n       A MUTANT BOUNCER, half his face a skull, blocks Scott's way.\n\n<b>                           MUTANT BOUNCER\n</b>                 Two drink minimum.\n\n<b>                           SCOTT\n</b>                 Ah, that's okay.

The \n       man's head is on backwards, his arms lean on the bar while \n       his face looks out into the crowd.

Holds one of those half pineapple \n       type drinks in his hand, except this one has the back end of \n       a wriggling lizard sticking out of mucousy fluid under a tiny \n       umbrella.

Freddy swinging his four \n       long knives.  Blade slashing her rapier-arms.  They lunge, \n       they parry, they leap, they duck.\n\n       CLANG!  They connect.  SCREEEEE.  Metal scrapes metal.  It's \n       a bastardized version of an Errol Flynn movie and Blade Cop \n       and Freddy are equally matched.  Blade moves to get the upper \n       hand.\n\n       CLINK CLINK!  Blades shoot out of the girl's ELBOWS.  Now \n       when she takes a swing with her fists, another sword is right \n       behind it on the follow-through.\n\n       Freddy gets caught off-guard.  Gets slashed twice in the \n       shoulder and twirls away.  Then starts to move FASTER.\n\n       Blade counters with an equally increased intensity.  Freddy \n       ducks, SWOOPS out twice quickly.  A fold of black cloth drops \n       down on Blade's stomach, revealing naked skin and a little \n       blood.  They pause for a second.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Touche.\n\n       And Blade becomes AIRBORNE putting a Samurai to shame, \n       twirling her legs up and out as a blade juts momentarily from \n       her RIGHT HEEL, chopping off Freddy's left hand.\n\n       Krueger stumbles back in astonishment as green goo spurts out \n       of the stump.\n\n       Astonishment turns to rage as the two converge again, \n       swinging away at an incredible rate.  An impossible rate.\n\n       JACOB rounds the corner.  He stumbles into the action just as \n       the battling pair are becoming an obscure swirling GLINTING \n       MASS.  Pieces of them start to drop away.\n\n       Blade's foot hits the ground.  Freddy's arm plops away.  A \n       broken sword hits the asphalt under the spinning cloud, then \n       one of Blade's arms.\n\n<b>       CLOSE ON JACOB\n</b>\n       as he watches, his eyes dart to try to follow the action \n       that's moving too fast for him to see.\n\n       Then there's silence.\n\n       We PULL BACK and PAN  to follow Jacob as he walks into the \n       scene of carnage.  He steps up to two pills of remains: one \n       black and flesh colored covered with red blood, the other a \n       heap of red and green cloth, scarred tissues, and pukish \n       green glop.\n\n       Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, \n       the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air.\n\n       Jacob sees something else and walks over to it.  It's Scott's \n       body.  Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I'm sorry, Scott.\n\n       A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up.  Over to the now-\n       silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the \n       cement.  With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from \n       the earth.\n\n       Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS.  \n       Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held \n       ABOVE FRAME over his neck.\n\n       Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his \n       stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.  With great \n       effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth.  \n\n       Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that \n       REALLY makes his eyes widen.  We get to see the shadow of \n       what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him.\n\n       The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop \n       begins to MOVE.  The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso, \n       arm to shoulder, head to neck.  The shadow on the wall rises \n       and we PULL BACK.\n\n       Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a \n       flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the \n       experience.\n\n       Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police \n       step around him.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Okay, I'm impressed\n\n       Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 You shouldn't be.\n\n       Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of \n       Freddy remains.  But they're not remains anymore.  All that's \n       left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants.\n\n       A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness.  \n       The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking \n       equally distraught.  They all face Jacob.\n\n                           BLADE COP (cont'd)\n                 This is what we were afraid of.\n\n<b>                           SOUND COP\n</b>                 He still exists.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 What!  How?\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 We're already dead, that's why he \n                 couldn't destroy us.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 But he's not dead.

He's unique.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 WE can't kill him.\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 We can wail away on each other until \n                 doomsday and not do any good.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Then who's going to kill this fucker?\n\n<b>                           SOUND COP\n</b>                 YOU have to.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 How the hell am I supposed to do that?\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 Krueger's power comes from his rage and \n                 the souls of children.\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 You have to find the original source of \n                 that rage and use it against him.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 This town in its present condition \n                 encompasses all evils from all times in \n                 its history.  The answer is here \n                 somewhere...\n\n       Jacob sighs, then gets an idea.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I think I know where...\n\n       And he starts to run down the street.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 Jacob, wait.  We have to find him first.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 No time.  You guys find Karen!\n\n       He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down \n       their visors\n\n<b>       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE\n</b>\n       Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down \n       building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation.  \n       This isn't just an ELM STREET house, it's THE Elm Street \n       house.  And for some reason Karen is drawn to it.  She looks \n       to her let at the bent mailbox.\n\n       It has a name plate on it.  Another one underneath it.  And \n       another.  It's as if people moved in and out and instead of \n       changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new \n       one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox.\n\n       The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it \n       with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on \n       rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says \n       THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The \n       name underneath makes Karen gasp.\n\n       It reads KRUEGER.\n\n       And there's still another one under that horrible name.  \n       Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign \n       reads UNDERWOOD.\n\n       Karen frowns.  She turns back to the house, a determined \n       expression on her face.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 No more...\n\n       She KICKS the gate open and walks up to the house.\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE\n</b>\n       We've been here before, haven't we?  But for Karen it's the \n       first visit as she opens the front door and walks in.  She \n       takes in the twisted skeleton of a home for a few seconds and \n       then begins to SEARCH it.\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - LIVING ROOM\n</b>\n       Karen races through, pulling open desk drawers, rifling \n       through shelves, flipping through books.  She doesn't know \n       what she's looking for, but she knows she hasn't found it \n       yet.\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - KITCHEN\n</b>\n       The intensity of Karen's quest increases as she yanks open \n       cabinets and tosses plates to the floor.  Still nothing.\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - STAIRS\n</b>\n       Karen runs up them, a girl with a mission.\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM\n</b>\n       Karen flings the door open.  Nothing but a bed and a set of \n       drawers.  No hint as to the occupant's lives.  She doesn't \n       bother ransacking this one and goes on to:\n\n<b>       INT. ELM STREET HOUSE - FREDDY'S BEDROOM\n</b>\n       Jackpot.  Karen stares through the open door at a child's \n       room, a very twisted child's room.  She slowly walks in.\n\n       A bed, a desk, a dresser.  There's a Jack-in-a-box with its \n       head torn off.  A disemboweled Teddy Bear.  White puffy guts \n       hanging out of it.  A clown doll with its face caved in.  A \n       hanging mobile made of strange bent shapes.\n\n       And a pile of more-than-dirty clothes.\n\n       Karen goes over to the pile and picks through it with her \n       toe.  A small pair of pants, about the right size for an \n       eight-year-old.  A black pair of shoes.  And a little \n       sweater, a RED AND GREEN STRIPED sweater.\n\n       Karen goes over to the desk.  There is stack of drawings on \n       it - a child's drawings.  On one of them it looks like \n       someone was practicing writing their name.  FREDDY UNNERWOOD, \n       FREDDY UNDERWUD, FREDDY UNDERWOOD over and over again.  Until \n       the final attempt has the last name angrily crossed out, \n       replaced underneath by a hastily scrawled KRUEGER!!!\n\n       Another piece of paper: a set of human stick figures.  A \n       small one is labeled FREDDY.  The large one is labeled DADDY.  \n       The Daddy figure is depicted HITTING the Freddy figure.\n\n       There are more drawings, all of them violent, the large \n       figure beating away at the small one.\n\n       Suddenly a CREAKING.  Karen jumps.  Hides behind a bookshelf.  \n       She's nervously trying to figure out what to do when a framed \n       picture catches her attention on the shelf.  It's a picture \n       of a tall, dark man and a little boy.  Karen reaches out to \n       grab the picture, but accidentally knocks over a glass mug \n       with a CRASH.\n\n       FOOTSTEPS can now be heard tromping up the stairs.  \n\n       Someone's coming and Karen's on the edge of panic.  She looks \n       around and finds an old baseball bat.  She grabs it and runs \n       to the side of the doorway as the FOOTSTEPS approach down the \n       hallway.  Karen raises the bat.\n\n       And Jacob appears.  Karen pulls back with the bat as Jacob \n       jumps away from her.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Jacob!  You scared the shit out of me!\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 The feeling is mutual.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Where are the Dream Police?\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I told them to look for you.

Look what I found.\n\n       She starts to drag him over to the desk of drawings.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 You've got to get out of here.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Wait.  You have to see this.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 You don't understand.  The Police can't \n                 kill Freddy.  They literally chopped each \n                 other to pieces and he's still alive!  \n                 Now I'm supposed to figure out how to get \n                 rid of him.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 But I think I found the answer.  Shut up \n                 for a second and look at these.\n\n       She starts showing him the scrawlings.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Okay, so he's a bad artist.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 No!

These are HIS past.  \n                 Don't you get it? HE was a foster child, \n                 too!\n\n       She walks over to the bookshelf and grabs the picture of \n       LITTLE FREDDY and FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER.\n\n                           KAREN (cont'd)\n                 Someone had to have taken care of him.  \n                 This guy...he was Freddy's father.  Those \n                 drawings...they were Freddy's childhood.  \n                 This house...it's where it all happened.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 But in reality Freddy hasn't lived here \n                 for decades.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Like you tried to tell me once before, \n                 this is a dream.

On Elm Street?\n\n       Jacob thinks for a second.  It's all starting to make sense.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 But what does this do for us?\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 There's got to be a way to use it against \n                 him.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Okay, but we're not going to stand around \n                 here to figure out how. It's too \n                 dangerous.\n\n       He grabs her hand and pulls her towards her door.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Let's get out of this house.\n\n       They head out to\n\n<b>       UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n</b>\n       And Blade Cop is standing in the middle of the corridor.  The \n       two teenagers stop.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Thank God.  Freddy's going to show up any \n                 minute.\n\n       KACHINK!  A knife shoots out of Blade's right hand, ready for \n       action.  (but wait a minute, her uniform isn't ripped \n       anymore...)  Karen and Jacob make their way to the stairs.  \n       He turns to Blade.\n\n                           JACOB (cont'd)\n                 Where are the others?\n\n       Blade walks up to him and stands there.  Then JAMS HER KNIFE \n       into JACOB'S GUT.  Karen SCREAMS.  Jacob chokes.  Blade Cop \n       shoves the knife in further until it juts out of Jacob's \n       back.  She turns.\n\n       Then BECOMES FREDDY.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Time to join your mommy.\n\n       Krueger yanks his finger blades out and Jacob's limp body \n       falls at Karen's feet.  Karen shrieks and cries, dropping to \n       her knees to hold him.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 No no no no no no no...Jacob...\n\n       He looks up at her, slowly dying.  She strokes his forehead \n       while Freddy laughs at the sentiment. \n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Young love...ha!\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 Karen...dream...powers....\n\n       And Jacob is gone.  Karen sobs, so torn apart that she is \n       ignoring the incredible danger above her.  But not for long.\n\n       Krueger grabs Karen by the neck.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 It's past your bedtime, young lady.\n\n       And he starts to DRAG her, kicking and screaming, her body \n       scraping across the floor towards the \n\n<b>       MASTER BEDROOM\n</b>\n       Freddy drags Karen in and TOSSES her across the room.  She \n       lands with a THUD on the bed.  He saunters over to her and \n       climbs up on the bed next to her.  Gets on top.\n\n       Karen yells and hits him uselessly with her fists and it's \n       horrible because there he is, pressing down on her, right in \n       her face, mounting her as if he's going to rape her.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Aw, sweetheart.  This won't hurt a bit.\n\n       She screams as he presses even harder.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Come on.  Be Daddy's little girl.\n\n       And the last three words of that sentence seem to ECHO \n       through the room, swirling around Karen.  DADDY'S LITTLE \n       GIRL.  \"Daddy's little girl.\"  Karen twists her head away.\n\n       And Freddy's become Karen's FATHER.  He looks down on her \n       with a lecherous grin.\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S FATHER\n</b>                 That's my baby.  That's Daddy's little \n                 girl.\n\n       Karen stops struggling.  The realization grows on her face \n       with the resurfacing memory.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Oh no...\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S FATHER\n</b>                     (Freddy's voice)\n                 Now do you remember?\n\n       She does.  And she has an answer for him.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 You're NOT my father.\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S FATHER\n</b>                 But we're going to have the same fun!\n\n       Karen stares at him defiantly.  And a HAND grabs Karen's \n       Father, and yanks him away.  We PULL BACK.  \n\n       KAREN'S MOTHER is next to the bed.  Furious.\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S MOTHER\n</b>                 That's enough!\n\n       And she SLAPS Karen's Father.  He stands up, SLUGS her across \n       the jaw.  She tumbles back.  Karen sits up.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Mommy, no!\n\n       Karen's Mother gets up, a defiant look just like Karen's on \n       her face.\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S MOTHER\n</b>                 You're never going to touch her again!\n\n<b>                           KAREN'S FATHER\n</b>                 I'll touch what I want!\n\n       BAP!  He strikes her again, sending her right out the door.  \n       He follows her. Karen stands up and runs after them.\n\n<b>       IN THE HALLWAY\n</b>\n       CRACK!  The man hits the woman down to the floor.  Karen's \n       mother stands up, just taking it.  She's at the top of the \n       stairs.  Karen's Father swings his arm back, and Karen jumps \n       on him.  He shrugs her away violently.\n\n<b>       WITH KAREN\n</b>\n       as she hits the ground and the wall next to Jacob's body.  \n       She looks up.\n\n<b>       WIDER\n</b>\n       And Karen's Father is now FREDDY again.  He swings his fist.  \n<b>       SMACK!\n</b>\n       Karen's Mother reels from the hit, falls backwards.  Karen \n       jumps up to try and help her, reaching past Freddy.  But it's \n       too late.\n\n       Karen's Mother tumbles down the stairs, head hitting, bones \n       cracking, disappearing into darkness.\n\n       Freddy grabs Karen by the neck and lifts her.  DANGLES her \n       over the top of the steps.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Be honored, bitch.  You're the last soul \n                 I need.\n\n       And Jacob RISES UP behind Krueger.  GRABS him.  Freddy DROPS \n       Karen.  She hits hard and rolls down the steps as Freddy \n       turns, his knives swinging out and SLAMMING Jacob's gut one \n       more time, IMPALING him against the wall.  Jacob gasps out \n       his final breath.\n\n<b>                           JACOB\n</b>                 I'll be back...\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 I'll be waiting.\n\n       Freddy pulls his blades out of Jacob and the wall.  The boy's \n       body hits the floor for the last time.  Freddy turns back to \n       the stairs and looks down them.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Where's my little pumpkin?\n\n       He strolls down the steps.\n\n<b>       DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY\n</b>\n       Freddy walks down and no one's there.  Karen's Mom was just \n       an illusion, but Karen herself, dead or alive, is nowhere to \n       be seen.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Play time is over, bitch.\n\n       He walks down the hallway.  Eyes darting.  Until a BOOMING \n       VOICE is heard from the kitchen.\n\n<b>                           VOICE\n</b><b>                 FREDERICK!\n</b>\n       Freddy cocks his head and frowns.\n\n                           VOICE (cont'd)\n                 Frederick!  What have you done?\n\n       And, amazingly, a look of FEAR crosses Krueger's face.  \n       Something about that voice has struck terror in the heart of \n       the creature that fears nobody.\n\n       Krueger turns to the kitchen door.  A man steps out of the \n       shadows, a big muscular man with a horrifying look in his \n       eyes.  A man we've seen somewhere before - in a picture.\n\n       It's FREDDY'S FOSTER FATHER - MR. UNDERWOOD.  And he looks \n       pissed beyond belief.\n\n       Freddy shrinks back, eyes widening.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 Daddy?\n\n<b>                           MR. UNDERWOOD\n</b>                 Don't you \"Daddy\" me!\n\n       Mr. Underwood raises his arm and SMACKS Freddy across the \n       skull.  Krueger tumbles back into the hallway.\n\n       Freddy scrambles to his feet.  Shakes with dread.  Looks like \n       a scared little boy.  Mr. Underwood advances on him.\n\n<b>                           FREDDY\n</b>                 No, Daddy. Please...\n\n       Freddy turns and bolts for the front door.  He flings it \n       open.  Power Cop stands in his way and SHOVES Freddy back - \n       back in front of his foster father.\n\n       PUNCH - a vicious blow from Underwood sends Krueger into\n\n<b>       THE LIVING ROOM\n</b>\n       where Freddy falls over a couch.  Underwood stomps into the \n       room. Krueger scrambles up and heads for the archway leading \n       into the dining room.\n\n       BLADE COP blocks the escape.  The ripped flap of her uniform \n       proving she's the real one. She KICKS Freddy back and into \n       Underwood's hands.  The man picks up Krueger and HITS him \n       again.  And again.  And again.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Stop.  You're hurting me.  Stop.\n\n       Freddy wriggles away and opens a window.  Sound Cop fills the \n       window, cutting him off.  Pushes him back inside.\n\n       Mr. Underwood grabs Krueger and slaps him over and over.  \n       Slugs him.  Gives the beating he's got coming to him.\n\n       And Freddy MOANS and YELLS like a blubbering child.  Shrinks \n       into a corner but is yanked out for more pummeling.\n\n       Power Cop stands at the exit to the hallway.  Blade Cop \n       continues to obstruct the dining room arch.  Sound Cop steps \n       through the window and stands in front of it.  The Dream \n       Police just stare in silence.\n\n       It's not a street fight, not a punching match.  Just a \n       ruthless thrashing that would be hard to watch if it weren't \n       for the fact that we are all cheering because no one in \n       history has ever deserved it more.\n\n       Underwood stops the whipping and stands over Krueger who is \n       lying on the ground whimpering, pleading for mercy.\n\n                           FREDDY (cont'd)\n                 Why, Daddy?  What did I do?\n\n<b>                           MR. UNDERWOOD\n</b>                 You took some things that don't belong to \n                 you!\n\n       And with that, Underwood brings his fist down and JAMS it \n       into Freddy's stomach.  Right THROUGH IT.  Shoving it into \n       his very body.\n\n       Freddy SCREAMS.  Underwood violently pulls his fist out and \n       there's SOMETHING in it.  A shimmering flowing thing.  \n       Crackling with unworldly LIGHT.  It's a SOUL.  It's Wesley's \n       SOUL.  Underwood flings his arm out and lets go.  Wesley's \n       soul flies into thin air and DISSIPATES.\n\n       Krueger's father brings his hand down again and RIPS out \n       GINA'S SOUL.  Again.  JACOB'S SOUL.  Freddy opens his mouth \n       and shrieks.  As Underwood raises his arms and begins to \n       SPARKLE.  FLASHES of light bounce around his body. He's \n       changing.\n\n       And something's happening to Freddy's too.  Steam is rising \n       from the creature.  His feet are starting to flatten as he \n       lays on the ground and BLACK GOO oozes from his pores.\n\n       He's melting.  And still screaming as he watches his foster \n       father's image turn into:\n\n       KAREN.  An aura of LIGHT vanishes around her body as she \n       lowers her arms with a victorious yet sad look on her face.  \n       Freddy DIES.\n\n       A look of horrified realization burns in Krueger's eyes as he \n       sees Karen and CONTINUES to scream inhumanly.\n\n       His body dissolves, all of it liquefying into BLACK SLIME.  \n       Gone.  Just a bubbling black puddle of gunk is left.  His \n       SHRIEK echoes through the room and everywhere else.\n\n       Then the GUNK grows and changes into a dark cloud that begins \n       to EXPAND.\n\n       Power Cop runs up, grabs Karen and yells.\n\n<b>                           POWER COP\n</b>                 We gotta get outta here!\n\n       Karen, almost mesmerized by the black cloud spreading in \n       front of her, stumbles away with Power Cop.\n\n<b>       EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE\n</b>\n       The Dream Police and Karen bolt out the front door and run \n       down the street as a RUMBLE joins Freddy's thunderous SHRIEK \n       and the entire town begins to SHAKE.\n\n       We stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations \n       continue.\n\n       And the Elm Street House EXPLODES.  The BLACK CLOUD punches \n       out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying \n       everywhere.\n\n       The rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then \n       falls to the ground.\n\n       All is SILENT.  And the dark cloud turns WHITE.  The milky \n       fog spreads out.\n\n<b>       EXT. ELM STREET INTERSECTION\n</b>\n       Karen falls to her knees on the pavement, not looking back at \n       the destruction one block away.\n\n       The Dream Police stop running to turn to face her.  Karen \n       hangs her head and cries.\n\n       Blade steps forward.\n\n<b>                           BLADE COP\n</b>                 It took a human touch.  It took knowing \n                 HIS nightmare.  Goodbye, Karen.\n\n       Karen raises her head as the Dream Police turn away.\n\n<b>       KAREN'S POV - THE DREAM POLICE\n</b>\n       walk off into the distance.  Just as they are about to vanish \n       into the darkness, a FOURTH FIGURE appears and joins them in \n       formation.  Then they all disappear.\n\n<b>       ANGLE ON KAREN\n</b>\n       Her mouth drops open at what she's just seen.  What she \n       DOESN'T see is the white cloud swooping down the street \n       behind her. She just closes her eyes as the ivory mist \n       envelops her and the SCREEN GOES WHITE.\n\n<b>       FADE IN FROM WHITE TO:\n</b>\n<b>       EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY\n</b>\n       Karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees.  \n       Her eyes open and squint at the bright light.  She sits up \n       and tries to get her bearings.  Some hair falls into her face \n       and she brushes it away.  Only then noticing that she's \n       holding something in her hand.\n\n       She opens her hand and looks down.\n\n<b>       KAREN'S POV\n</b>\n       It's an ID bracelet.  A band of gold with a larger plate \n       dangling from the middle of it.  Karen's hand turns it over.  \n       This time the printing reads JACOB.\n\n<b>       WITH KAREN\n</b>\n       she chokes back the tears.  We hear a PANTING O.S.  Then a \n       woman's voice.\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 You okay, honey?\n\n       Karen looks up as we PULL BACK.  A pleasant-looking woman, no \n       longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog.  She looks \n       sincerely concerned.  Karen nods.\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Yes.  I'm alright.\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 I've never seen you around.  Are you new \n                 in town?\n\n<b>                           KAREN\n</b>                 Sort of.\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 Well then...\n                     (she smiles)\n                 Welcome to Springwood.\n\n       The woman continues on her way.  Karen sighs and puts the \n       bracelet on her wrist.  She stands and our SHOT PULLS UP AND \n       AWAY as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town \n       she's never seen - except in her dreams.\n\n<b>                                                          FADE OUT.\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Nightmare on Elm Street: The Final Chapter</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Wes Craven\" title=\"Scripts by Wes Craven\">Wes Craven</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Rachel Talalay\" title=\"Scripts by Rachel Talalay\">Rachel Talalay</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Nightmare on Elm Street: The Final Chapter Script.html#comments\" title=\"Nightmare on Elm Street: The Final Chapter comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:34.201791"}
