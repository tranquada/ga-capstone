The sounds of deep moaning and sexual huffs and puffs. After a few seconds the sound grows even louder. It should sound as if the two people are fucking into a microphone. The sounds should be painful and raw.\n\nGIRL (O.S.)\nOh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.\n\n\nINT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe face of a very pretty young girl with long blond hair. Her face is inches from the CAMERA, the CAMERA is above her, looking down, almost like the POV of the person she's having sex with. She id breathing extremely heavily; her face is red-hot and sweaty. Every time she moves, she makes a deep moaning noise. She looks likes she's on the verge of pain and ecstasy.\n\nGIRL\nOh yes, Telly it hurts, oh yes, oh yes, please Telly, Telly.\n\nThe CAMERA backs up to reveal Telly having sex with the girl. Telly is seventeen years old. He is short, dirty, slightly muscular, he has an interesting face, he is a street-smart punk, He is biting his bottom lip, the two of them are sweating like mad, the sound of the bed post smashing against the wall combines with the rhythmical moaning of the two.\n\nRAPID FADE TO BLACK\n\n\nBACK IN TIME - BEFORE THEY HAD SEX\n\nTelly is in bed with the girl. The two of them are sitting up in the big bed that is raised high of the ground. Telly is naked except for a tight pair of white underwater. He is sitting above the blankets with his legs spread apart. The girl is partially covered, she is wearing a black bra, one of her nipples is poking through. The two of them are very sweaty, they both have messed up hair, there is a great feeling of heat and wetness.\n\nThe windows to her room are open, the sound of outside of outside traffic is circulating. There is a small fan on her dresser that is blowing from side to side. Socks, shirts, and pants are lying on her hard wood floor. The room is neat except for the clothing. A large poster of the Beastie Boys hangs on the wall. She has many stuffed animals on her bed and dresser drawer, she also has a small dollhouse in the corner.\n\nTelly and the girl are looking at each other.\n\nThe girl speaks slowly and softly, she has a very innocent beauty about her.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what I want to do?\n\nGIRL\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do I want to do?\n\nGIRL \nYou want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWhy?\n\nGIRL\nBecause, you know why. You know.\n\nTELLY\nBecause your a virgin?\n\nGIRL\nBecause I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.\n\nTELLY\nYou think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.\n\nGIRL\nWhy is that?\n\nTELLY\nBecause I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.\n\nGIRL\nI wouldn't believe it?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. I just think that you would love it.\n\nGIRL\nBut, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.\n\nTELLY\nWhat things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  \n(he begins to caress her cheek and hair)\nI want to make you happy. That's all.\n\nTelly scoots up to the girl and starts to kiss her. He sticks his tongue in her mouth. They kiss.\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nYou know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.\n\nGIRL\n(whispering)\nDo you care about me?\n\nTELLY\n(whispering)\nOf course I do.\n\nRAPID CUT TO BLACK\n\n\nAN EXTREME CLOSEUP OF THE GIRL'S FACE\n\nAs she screams in total agony. Telly and the girl are on the bed having sex. All the lights are on. This scene should look very white and bleached out, very electric and shocking. Everything should be exposed as Telly takes advantage of the virgin girl.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\n(slowly)\nVirgins. I love 'em. No diseases, no loose as a goose pussy, no skank. No nothin. Just pure pleasure.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nTHE CREDITS ROLL IN\n\nAs soon as the scene ends, so does the sound of the two having sex. Very fast, very hard-paced music accompanies the credits. The music should be strong enough to maintain the intensity of the scene, Hard-core, Punk.\n\nCREDITS STOP\n\nFADE IN:\n\n\nINT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nTelly gently shuts the door. He has a huge smile on his face. He looks down the center of the staircase and spits. He watches his spit fall down till it smacks against the floor. He runs down three flights of stairs as quickly as possible. He jumps down the last four steps and bumps into the side of the wall. He is very happy. He runs down the skinny hallway and smacks the metal mailboxes.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nTelly exits the building. CASPER is sitting on a middle step. He is reading a comic book and drinking a 40oz. Bottle of malt liquor. The bottle is wrapped in a brown paper sack. As he sips his drink he laughs at his comic book.\n\nCasper is Telly's second half. The two have been best friends since grade school. Casper is small and funny, everyone likes him, he has a quick temper, and he isn't scared to fight someone twice his size. Telly provides Casper with a sense of adolescent wisdom. Casper makes Telly happy; he's a smart ass, he has a strong New York accent, an assortment of tattoos, and crooked teeth. Telly and Casper are always together, They help each other to survive.\n\nTelly smacks Casper on the back of his head. Casper is startled and spills a little bit of his beer onto his shoes.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\n(smiling)\nWas up bitch?\n\nCasper looks at Telly smiling.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit what happened?\n\n\nCasper is very excited. He stands up and pulls Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you think?\n\nCASPER\nYou fucked it?\n\nTelly laughs and Casper jumps up and down.\n\nCASPER\nI knew you fucked it! I sat out her for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!\n\nTELLY\n(pounding his chest)\nWho am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.\n\nThey both start to laugh.\n\nThey move off the stairs and start walking down the sidewalk. The two of them are walking down the street, obvious to everything but themselves talking.\n\nCASPER\nWell, how was it?\n\nTELLY\nOh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.\n\nCASPER\nShe can fuck?\n\nTELLY\nHell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.\n\nCASPER\nOh shit. How long did it take?\n\nTELLY\nDid what take?\n\nCASPER\nHow long did you fuck her?\n\nThey cross the street, paying no attention to speeding cars. Casper is listening to every word that Telly says. Casper seems much happier than Telly. Telly is laid-back. Casper is hyper as he jumps up and down and claws Telly's arm.\n\nTELLY\nWell it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nBut then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.\n\nCASPER\nHow did she smell? Did her puss stink?\n\nTelly puts his four fingers together and then puts his hand in front of Caper's nose.\n\nTELLY\nTake a whiff.\n\nCasper takes a huge whiff, the snot in his nose makes a loud sound as he smells Telly's fingers.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, it smells like butterscotch.\n\nTELLY\nHell's yeah. She was so clean.\n\nCASPER\nOh man, that's the best.\n\nTELLY\nYou could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.\n\nCASPER\nLet me smell it again.\n\nTelly lifts his fingers once again, as Casper breathes in the odor. \n\nCASPER\nThat's why virgins are the best. I love that smell.\n\nAs they walk down the street, joggers, men in business suits with briefcases, ambulances, and women with baby carriages all pass by.\n\nTELLY\nYou know what else?\n\nCASPER\nWhat?\n\nTELLY\nI can tell that she had just entered puberty.\n\nCASPER\nHow?\n\nTELLY\nWell, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right. \n \nCASPER\nRight.\n\nTELLY\nAnd there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cut when you were little.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.\n\nCasper starts to crack up.\n\nTELLY\nAnd I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd for a second I felt a little bit guilty. You know, because she's young and all. And then I was like, oh shit, that turns me on. I wanna fuck this little baby girl.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nCASPER\nFuckin perverted bastard.\n\nThey continue to laugh and walk.\n\nTELLY\nI'm telling you Casper. I think I'm getting addicted to that shit.\n\nCASPER\nTo what? Virgins?\n\nTELLY\nYeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.\n\nCASPER\nWhat do you mean?\n\nTELLY\nI mean I'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.\n\nCASPER\nYou mean like fucking two virgins at once.\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nThat would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nShe's probably smash you in the fucking face.\n\nTELLY\nI don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.\n\nCASPER\nDid you tell her that you loved her?\n\nTELLY\nLike. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.\n\nThey stop walking. Casper takes the last sip of his beer, then throws it toward an orange trash can. He misses the can and the bottle smashes in the middle of a busy street.\n\nCASPER\nShit.\n\nTELLY\nWhat do you want?\n\nCASPER\nGet another forty.\n(burps)\nSmoke a blunt.\n\nTELLY\nAre you hungry?\n\nCASPER\nHell yeah. Fuckin starvin. Wait up a sec.\n\nCasper takes two steps away and starts urinating in someone's bushes. People walk by and stare.\n\nTELLY\nYou wanna go to Paul's house?\n\nCASPER\nWhat for? That guys a dick.\n\nTELLY\nI'm sue he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer. \n\nCASPER\nYou think he's got any herb?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know, he quit dealin but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.\n\nCASPER\nYou think?\n\nTELLY\nProbably.\n\nCASPER\nHe lives on 76th?\n\nTELLY\n78th.\n\nCASPER\nDen less go Joe.\n\nHe zips up his pants.\n\nThey start walking again. Casper is carrying a folded up comic book in his hand.\n\nCASPER\nTelly.\n\nTELLY\nYeah.\n\nCASPER\nDid she suck your dick?\n\nTELLY\nA little bit. But I didn't really want her to.\n\nCASPER\nWhy?\n\nTELLY\nI don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.\n\nCASPER\nIt is right.\n\nTELLY\nI want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.\n\nCASPER\nIt's no big deal, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.\n\nCASPER\nYeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.\n(they both start laughing)\nIt's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nCASPER\nThey're gonna tell their grand kids.\n(mimicking an old lady)\nThat Telly. He sure was good in the sack!\n\nThe two of them are laughing, their conversation has gotten them very excited.\n\nThey walk in front of a Korean grocery. The grocery has a small outdoor produce section, juice, fruit, sodas, etc. A KOREAN GUY with flip-flops and headphones is sitting on a tall wooden stool.\n\nTELLY\nYou thirsty?\n\nCASPER\nYeah, I feel dehydrated.\n\nTELLY\nYou got any money?\n\nCASPER\nThree pennies and a ball of lint.\n\nTELLY\nYou down with the boost?\n\nCASPER\n(whispers)\nUnzip my pack, yo.\n\nHe turns around and Telly quickly unzips his backpack.\n\n\nINT. KOREAN GROCERY - DAY\n\nThe grocery is your basic traditional market with a lunch buffet. Behind the cash register is a middle-aged KOREAN MAN. He is watching a small black and white television set.\n\nThe two boys enter.\n\nCasper walks straight to the back where they keep the beer. \n\nTelly circles the buffet and then walks up to the cash register.\n\nTELLY\nUh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER  \nWhah?\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg. I'm curious if you have it?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah is dissdee?\n\nCasper is going through the beer section. He pulls out two 40oz. bottles of and puts them on the floor.\n\nTELLY\nDiss digg, diss digg, diss digg.\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nI no understand you. Maybe crazy.\n\nA round mirror is reflecting Casper putting the bottles into his backpack.\n\nTELLY\nI'll ask you one last time. Do you have diss digg?\n\nKOREAN STORE OWNER\nWhah you say? Dissdee?\n\nCasper runs up to the counter and grabs his crotch.\n\nCASPER\nHe said This Dick, mutha fucka! Can't you understand English?\n\nThe two of them both run out the door.\n\nTelly taps the Korean man who is sitting outside. The man looks in the opposite direction while Casper grabs two peaches and puts them into his pocket.\n\nThe two boys run off.\n\nThe Korean man gets off his stool. He pulls his headphones off his ears.\n\nKOREAN MAN\nStupy fucky boys! Fucky!\n\nHe looks at his fruit stand and puts a peach in the spot that Casper previously stole from.\n\n\nEXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - APARTMENT - DAY\n\nCasper and Telly are walking down the street. Casper is eating a peach and drinking his 40oz. beer. Telly is also drinking.\n\nCASPER\nYou know like in \"The Wonder Twins\" they share everything.\n\nTELLY\nThe cartoon?\n\nCASPER\nYeah. \"The Wonder Twins\". You know.\n(mimics the cartoon)\nActivate in the form of, a glass of water.\n\nTELLY\nYeah.\n\nCASPER\nWell, those guys share everything, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight.\n\nCASPER\nAnd once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?\n\nTELLY\nRight.\n\nCASPER\nAnd it got me thinkin. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nYeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.\n\nCASPER\nNo, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated \"Wonder Twins\"!\n \nThe two of them start laughing and jumping on each other. Telly spits out a mouthful of beer.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nCan you do it man?\n\nTELLY\n(laughing)\nCan I do it? I just brooke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.\n\nCasper is jumping up and down on Telly's shoulder.\n\nCASPER\nOh man. I fucking love this guy.\n\nThe two of them walk off laughing.\n\n\nEXT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nA medium sized apartment building on the Upper East Side. Cars are speeding by the front of the building. Cabs drive by and beep their horns.\n\nTelly and Casper are sitting on the front steps. Telly rings one of the buttons. The bottom switchboard is plastered with skateboarding stickers and \"Legalize Marijuana\" stickers. A Vespa scooter is parked on the outside in front of the building, it also has stickers on it.\n\nTelly rings it again. It is a very hot day, both boys are wiping sweat from their bodies.\n\nPAUL\n(from box)\nHello?\n\nTELLY\nIt's me. Telly.\n\nPAUL\n(from box)\nHello?\n\nTELLY\n(loudly)\nPaul it's Telly. Open up.\n\nA buzz is heard.\n\nThere is a little girl sitting on the bottom step, playing with a doll. Casper runs down and gives her a peach. Then he runs back up.\n\nTelly and Casper enter the building.\n\nThe little girl tosses the peach to the ground.\n\n\nINT. PAUL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\nThere are about ten guys in the apartment. There is almost no furniture, just two white couches and a few plants in the corner. There is a big TV in the center of the floor. A Nintendo with several wires is hooked up to it. There are various games spread out. A couple of boys are huddled around the game, as they watch the guy play, they breathe in the wip-it's. \n\nThe boys are all young and spread out. There are people lying on the couch, on the floor, on the phone, in the kitchen smoking pot and doing wip-its. They are all colors and sizes.\n\nCasper and Telly go to each person and greet them with a handshake. Some people they hug. They say \"Was up,\" to everyone.\n\nThey both sit down on the floor and continue to drink their beers.\n\nPaul sits down besides them.\n\nPAUL\nWhat are you guys doing?\n\nTELLY\nNothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.\n\nPAUL\nYou want a wip-it?\n\nTELLY\nNah.\n\nCASPER\nYeah.\n\nPaul puts his hand on his big pocket and gives Casper a cartridge. Casper breathes in the wip-it and then smiles really big.\n\nCASPER\nI love these shits.\n\nPAUL\nThey're good for you. Vitamin C for the new generation.\n\nPaul hands Casper another cartridge.\n\nCASPER\nThat's why I like 'em. They wake my brain up.\n\nCasper does the wip-it.\n\nSTANLEY, a tall black kid with dreads, walks out of the kitchen. He has a cordless phone in his hand. Casper continues to do wip-it's. One after another.\n\nTELLY\nSo, how many people live here now?\n\nPAUL\nI don't know, eight or nine.\n\nTELLY\nWhere does everyone sleep?\n\nPAUL\nEverywhere. Fuckin flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.\n\nSTANLEY\nYo Telly. Jennie says what's up.\n\nTELLY\nJennie who?\n\nSTANLEY\nJennie. You know.\n\nCASPER\nThat girl you boned last year. Remember?\n\nTELLY\nMan I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?\n\n\nINT. RUBY'S ROOM - DAY\n\nFive girls are sitting in a small room. They are smoking. They're all in a circle laughing. The girls are all good friends. A few of them have rings in their lips and eyebrows. A big dirty fish tank is on one of the bookshelves.\n\nRuby is a nice looking girl, age 17. She is Spanish, her hair is slicked back, she chain-smokes.\n\nJennie is a 15 year old high school sophomore. She is white. She is very pretty, with an uncommon touch of innocence about her.\n\nThe next episode is going to jump-cut back and forth between Paul's apartment and Rubby's room. These scenes should be handheld.\n\nRuby hangs up the phone.\n\nRUBY\nTelly says was up.\n\nJENNIE\nI knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.\n\nRUBY\nYou still mad at him?\n\nJENNIE\nOf course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!\n\nSUSAN\nWhat did he do?\n\nRuby cuts of Jennie.\n\nRUBY\nHe stole her virginity. He took it away and now it's gone forever.\n\nLaughter.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah. But it's not even the fact that he devirginized me. It's the fact that after it was done he never spoke to me again. He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.\n\nLINDA\nThat's the kinda shit he's into. Telly is known for that stuff. He fucked Amber the same way.\n\nSUSAN\nAnd Susan too.\n\nJENNIE\nBut he was all like, Oh Jennie I like you so much. Trust me you'll love it, I'm not gonna use you. I promise. He was poppin mad jazz.\n\nMore laughter from the group.\n\nThey all speak very quickly, almost to the point where you can't understand them.\n\nSUSAN\nFirst times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.\n\nRUBY\nThat shit is nothin. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin asshole who was like 18.

PAUL'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nSome of the guys are sitting in front of the couch doing wip-its. Casper is chewing on a microwave burrito and watching the guy next to him play Nintendo. He is blowing into the burrito.\n\nThey are in the midst of a conversation.\n\nSTANLEY\nYeah, yeah, yeah!\n\nPAUL\nThat's the one thing.

Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.\n\nRUBY\nHell yeah, they don't know.\n\nThey all start laughing and clapping hands and snapping fingers.\n\nJENNIE\nLike where are your erogenous zones?\n\nRUBY\nMine?\n\nJENNIE\nMine are like my neck and my chest.\n\nLINDA\nYeah.

They simultaneously walk up to the turnstile and pull back the revolving metal guard. Then they slip through very nonchalantly.\n\nA short BLING GUY is playing the accordion. He is standing up and tapping his feet. He's playing \"Danny Boy\". In front of his feet is a large leather briefcase with dollar bills and scattered change.\n\nCasper and Telly walk up to the Blind Guy. They watch him for a second, then Casper starts to clap with his beer in his hand. He starts to smile really big.\n\nTelly sees Casper smiling and then he begins to smile.\n\nCASPER\nMan, this guy is really good.\n\nTELLY\nHe looks like my uncle.\n\nCasper looks at the money collection.\n\nCASPER\nI bet he makes hella money.\n\nA train comes speeding by.\n\nCasper walks next to the Blind Guy and starts dancing really funny.

A table is in the middle of the floor, magazines and pocketbooks. A water jug is in the corner. A ceiling fan is circling fast up above.\n\nAn assortment of men and women of different races and colors. They look mainly middle class. Jennie and Ruby are the youngest people in the room.\n\nA man in a three-piece suit slowly walks by. Jennie tries to see his face but he is turned the wrong way. Ruby continues to talk.\n\nThe same fat black nurse walks out with a clipboard. She begins to cough tremendously.\n\nRUBY\n... I don't know, I think he's mad at me, but who cares...\n\nRuby and Jennie stop talking and look at the black nurse. She is coughing uncontrollably. She looks like a large shaking figure. A skinny nurse walks by, pounds her on the back, and she stops coughing.\n\nThe black nurse has a smile on her face, her eyes watery. She turns and looks at Ruby.\n\nBLACK NURSE\nWoowee! It must have been something I ate!\n(coughs then smiles)\nRuby, follow me.\n\nRuby stands up and looks at Jennie. Ruby crosses both her fingers and raises them in the air.\n\nRUBY\nWish me luck.\n\nJENNIE\nGood luck.\n\nRuby follows the black nurse. This should be one long shot, as Ruby follows the nurse through the hectic testing clinic. The two of them enter the same room as before.\n\n\nINT.

SUBWAY CAR - DAY\n\nTelly and Casper are sitting side by side. Casper is holding a 40oz. bottle of beer. The train is semi-crowded; all seats are taken and there are a few people standing up. The train shakes. They are headed downtown.\n\nCasper and Telly are looking at the couple directly across from them. They are two unattractive lower-class Spanish people, they are holding hands and kissing.\n\nTELLY\nI wanna fuck Darcy.\n\nCASPER\nWho?\n\nTELLY\nDarcy. Benny's little sister.\n\nCASPER\nOh.

And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.\n\nCASPER\n(excited)\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nI watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nYeah.\n\nTELLY\nAnd after about two seconds, I got the biggest hard-on.\n\nCasper starts laughing.\n\nTELLY\nI'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.\n\nCASPER\nI know what you mean.\n\nTELLY\nAt that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.\n\nCASPER\nShe hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.\n\nTELLY\nI'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.\n\nCASPER\n(laughing)\nHow are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day?

I gotta stop off home too.\n\nAt this point the sound of the subway door is heard. A black man with no legs pushes himself through with his hands. He has a large container filled with change. As he enters, his cup of change is heard smashing back and forth. His face is even with people's knees. A random few stuff change and dollar bills into his cup. He sings as he pushes his way through the cat. He has an afro pick sticking out the back of his head. He is wearing a shirt that says \"KISS ME I'M POLISH\".\n\nLEGLESS MAN\n(singing)\nI have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs. I have no legs.\n\nAs he pushes his way closer, Casper starts checking his all his pockets. When he gets about three feet away, Casper stands up and throws some pennies into his cup. He sits back down next to Telly.\n\nThe legless man stops and smiles at Casper.\n\nLEGLESS MAN\nThank you. God bless you.\n\nCASPER\nYeah. Bless you back.\n\nThe legless man makes his way into the next car.\n\nTELLY\nI don't understand why you do that.\n\nCASPER\nWhy I do what?\n\nTELLY\nThat.\n\nCASPER\nWhy I give pennies?\n\nTELLY\nYeah. Why you give money.\n\nCASPER\nDid you look at that guy? What the fuck. He had no legs.\n(motions to his waist)\nHe had no half his lower body. He's gotta shit out of his ribcage.\n\nTELLY\nThat's just it. It's elitist. It's reverse elitism. Because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. I notice what you do.\n\nCASPER\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nTELLY\nWhenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.\n\nCASPER\nSo.\n\nTELLY\nSo. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.\n\nCASPER\nSo. You never know when you can end up like that.\n\nTELLY\nRight.\n\nCASPER\nI'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.\n\nTELLY\nShut up.\n\nCASPER\nI'm telling you the truth. And after that, I've always givin' my money to retards. Because that's the reverse of what he did.\n\nTelly is laughing.\n\nCASPER\nSo really, it's good luck.\n\nTELLY\nGood luck?\n\nCASPER\nYeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\n\nINT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY\n\nRuby and Jennie are squeezed into a telephone booth. They are on a busy street.

She begins shaking her hands back and forth.\n\nJENNIE\nRuby. Do you have a quarter?\n\nRuby hands her a quarter. Jennie dials her house.\n\nJENNIE\n(into phone) \nPeter, is Mom there? No, I need to speak to Mommy... Peter where's Mommy? No, I can't talk to you right now. Yeah... I hear it... look just tell her... No never mind...

Jennie starts walking and wiping the tears out of her eyes.\n\nRUBY\nJen!\n\nJennie looks back at Ruby and then starts running down the street.\n\nRUBY\n(screaming)\nJennie!\n\nJennie is running down the street full speed. She is passing all the people on the sidewalk. Then she darts across the street and through the traffic. Some people stare. She continues to run as the CAMERA follows her for a full block. She bumps into people and pushes them away.\n\n\nEXT. TELLY'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nTelly and Casper walk up to the house. Telly lives in a flat on St. Marks; downtown.

He looks around and then puts it in Casper's face.\n\nRAS\nFucking good skunk.\n\nCASPER\nSmells delicious.\n\nCasper starts to laugh.\n\nTelly goes to hand the drug dealer the money. Ras looks around to make sure it's safe.\n\nRAS\nThrow it down.\n\nHe points to the floor; then throws the weed on the ground. Telly drops two five dollar bills.\n\nCASPER\nThanks Ras.\n\nRAS\nCaspa!!!\n\nRas laughs. The two of them slap hands. Ras slaps Telly's hand and walks away.\n\n\nEXT. UNDER THE ARCH - WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY\n\nThe park is extremely crowded. The kids hang out in front of the arch by the fountain and around the sides. There are about ten kids skateboarding. The fountain is on and the mist is spraying the kids. Girls in hip-hop fashion are lined up all around. A few kids are drawing graffiti in little black books. There are maybe twenty kids hanging out around the fountain, in front of the arch.\n\nCasper and Telly walk up to the center of the action.\n\nThey greet their friends sitting on the edge of the fountain. Skateboarders ride up and slap their hands. As they greet their friends, they kiss the girls on the cheek and a few of them on the lips, they slap hands with the guys and embrace some with a hug.\n\nTelly and Casper go down the line, greeting everyone. This process takes a while, as they interact with everyone down the line.\n\nHAROLD is a skinny black skateboarder with a funny face. He rides up to Casper and hugs him.\n\nHAROLD\nCasper! Was up kid?\n\nCASPER\nNothen B. \n\nHAROLD\nWhere you at?\n\nCASPER\nRight here.\n\nHAROLD\nWhere you goin tonight?\n\nCASPER\nMaybe Nasa.

I need some female vagina tonight.\n\nHAROLD\nI had a female vagina last night.\n\nHAMILTON, a short black guy with a Gilligan hat, walks up.\n\nHAMILTON\nYo Cass, you got any boom?\n\nTelly is sitting on the cement benches talking to MISHA, a pretty young girl with a belly button pierce.\n\nCASPER\nYep. You got a Phillie?\n\nHAMILTON\nPresto.\n\nHamilton pulls out a long Phillie cigar. Then he squeezes in between Casper and another guy.\n\nCasper pulls out his dime bag and sniffs it. The he puts it in front of Hamilton's nose.\n\nHAMILTON\nYou got that here in the park?\n\nCASPER\nYep.\n\nHAMILTON\nBreak that shit up.\n\nCasper is smushing the pot up. Hamilton is taking the plastic of the cigar. In this shot they go through the complete process of rolling a blunt. The next sequence\nshould be done with fast edits.\n\nHAMILTON\nCut it.\n\nHamilton cuts the cigar down the center with his long thumbnail.\n\nHAMILTON\nScrape it.\n\nHe then scrapes all the tobacco out of the center and onto the ground. \n\nHAMILTON\nLick it.\n\nHe then licks the outer paper till it gets very damp.\n\nHAMILTON\nDump it.\n\nCasper starts putting the weed inside, Hamilton licks it, then pulls out a lighter and dries it.\n\nHAMILTON\nAnd smoke it.\n\nHamilton puts it in his mouth.\n\nHAMILTON\nYou wanna start off?\n\nHamilton looks at Casper and puts the blunt in his face.\n\nCASPER\nNaw, you got it Ham.\n\nHamilton smiles.\n\nHAMILTON\nAll right.\n\nHe puts the blunt in his mouth and lights it. A big flame shoots up as it catches the end of the Phillie. Hamilton takes a few big puffs and then blows the smoke away.\n\nHAMILTON\nTake two pulls and pass.\n\nHamilton passes the blunt to Casper. A bunch of kids start huddling around Casper as he puffs.\n\nSTEVEN, a skinny Spanish kid with gold front teeth, walks up.\n\nSTEVEN\nYo can I fuck wit dat?\n\nCasper smiles and blows smoke in his face.\n\nCASPER\nYeah boy!\n\nCasper hits it again and then hands it to Steve, who takes immense hits.\n\nTwo male homosexuals in short shorts walk by holding hands.\n\nSteven turns his head and notices them. He exhales the smoke out of his nose.\n\nSTEVEN\nLook at that.\n\nHAROLD\nThat shit is sick. Fuckin faggots.\n\nCASPER\n(screaming at the top of his lungs)\nFuckin faggots!!!\n\nEveryone starts laughing.\n\nCASPER\n(as loud as possible)\nFaggots!!!\n\nCasper rubs his throat. People continue to laugh.\n\nCASPER\nMy throat.\n\nTelly is sitting away on the cement benches under the tree. He is talking to Misha.\n\nMISHA\nHow can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.\n\nTELLY\nYou think so?\n\nMISHA\nYeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.\n\nTELLY\nHe still does.\n\nMISHA\nI hate 'em.\n\nTELLY\nIt's not his fault. He had a hard life.\n\nMISHA\nYeah?\n\nTELLY\nYou've heard the stories right?\n\nMISHA\nNo.\n\n\nEXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - DAY\n\nBack in time. Casper is a little boy, age 11. He is walking down the sidewalk with a lunch box and a \"Casper the Friendly Ghost\" T-shirt. He is wearing his hat on backwards.\n\nMusic accompanies this entire episode.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nWell, one day Casper had a stomachache and he got permission from his teacher to leave school early and go home.\n\nCasper walks up to a nice middle-class home, it could be in Queens or Brooklyn, it doesn't matter. He pulls out a key and opens the door. He enters his home.\n\n\nINT. CASPER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\nThe house is dark. Plastic on all the furniture. A velvet picture of Christ is hanging on the wall in the hallway. Very simple and plain, a generic adobe.\n\nCasper enters his house and flips on a lightswitch.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he walks into his house and hears some strange noises.\n\nThe sounds of his mother screaming from upstairs. \n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nGet away! Get away! Help! You monster! Please help!\n\nCasper puts his lunch box down and walks to the first stair to listen to his mother's screams.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nThe noises were coming from upstairs. In his parents room.\n\nCasper's mom continues to scream from upstairs.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo, this freaked the hell out of Casper. He was just a little kid and he wasn't sure what to do.\n\nCasper moves off the step and runs into the kitchen.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he ran and got a big knife. The same knife his pops used to cut the turkey on Thanksgiving with.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of silverware and pulls out a humongous glistening knife. He picks it up, and it shines on his face.\n\nAs his mother screams he looks up at the ceiling with the knife in his hand.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming from upstairs)\nStop! Please stop! Oooh help!\n\nCasper runs up the stairs, he is holding the knife straight out.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo he heard his mom's screams, and knew that she was in trouble. It sounded like she was getting ready to be killed. Like someone was kicking her in the head.\n\nCasper runs down the hall and opens the door to his parents room.\n\nWhat he sees is very shocking. His face becomes extremely animated.\n\nCasper's mom is on the bed. She is completely naked except for a pair of bright red high heel shoes. In between her legs is a man wearing all black, including a black ski mask and motorcycle boots. He is having sex with Casper's mom. He has her arms pinned down on the bed. He is grunting like a pig.\n\nCasper watches for a moment in awe.\n\nMAN IN BLACK\nBitch. You fuckin bitch. Fuckin bitch. Slutty whore.\n\nThe man in black slaps Casper's mom hard on her naked ass.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(screaming)\nNo! Stop! Get off me!\n\nShe is struggling to get loose.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper opened the door and he saw some big guy with a ski mask fucking his mother. What a sight for an 11 year old kid.\n\nCasper runs up to the bed. He climbs on top of the bed with the big knife in the air, all the while the man in black is having sex with his mother. And they don't even notice Casper at first.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd he goes and jumps on his parent's bed. And for a second he just looks and watches.\n\nCasper takes his knife and starts stabbing the guy in black, over and over. His mother is kicking and trying to stop him. All the while, she is screaming outrageously and blood is pouring out.\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nAnd you know. Casper loved his mom, he didn't want anything to happen to her. So he started stabbing this guy, over and over. But it was a mistake.\n\nCasper's mom is kicking Casper as he stabs the man.\n\nCasper is biting his tongue as he stabs the man.\n\nThe man falls off the bed and onto the floor.\n\nCasper's mom is going totally nuts. She is completely naked, with blood all over her body. There is blood all over the sheets. His mom is clawing her face in complete hysterics.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nYou fuck!!! It's your father!!! We were playing a game you fuck!!! That's your father!!! We were just playing!!!\n\nCasper looks very confused as he looks at his naked mother. He has the knife in his hand, and a little blood on his T-shirt and cheek.\n\nCasper's mom continues to yell at him.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\nCasper, you fucker!!! Oh, my god!!! Help me God!!!\n\nCasper looks at his mother, then he looks at the dead guy on the floor. He bends down and takes off the mask. It's his father.\n\nCASPER\n(calmly)\nThat's my dad.\n\nCASPER'S MOM\n(crying)\nYou fuck. You killed your father!\n\nTELLY (V.O.)\nSo Casper killed his father. He came home with a stomachache and ended up murdering his pops. It was a very embarrassing thing.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON A CEMENT BENCH - DAY\n\nTelly is in the same spot talking to Misha.\n\nTELLY\nSo that's why Casper is how he is.\n\nMISHA\nOh god. That's horrible.\n\nA quick shot of Casper smoking a blunt and laughing with his friends.\n\nTELLY\nYep.\n\nMISHA\nHoly shi. That's all true?\n\nTELLY\nNo. I was just kidding.\n\nMISHA\n(outraged)\nWhat?!\n\nTELLY\nI lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.\n\n\nEXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - ON THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nCasper and all his friends are passing around the blunt, which by now is almost gone. All that is left is a roach and Casper is sucking on it really hard.\n\nCasper breathes out the smoke and then passes the roach to Hamilton.\n\nCASPER\nYo, that weed is mad good.\n\nHamilton gets ready to puff.\n\nHAMILTON\nHells yeah. Gimmie a taste of the mothafuckin chronic.\n\nCasper rubs his eyes.\n\nHamilton puffs on the little roach.\n\nCasper grabs somebody's skateboard and stands on it. He starts rolling around slowly and doing some tricks.\n\nThe other kids continue to smoke. They watch Casper and laugh.\n\nCasper is slowly trying to do tricks, but he's so stoned that he just falls off.\n\nAs he skates in front of is friends he doesn't pay any attention to where he's going.\n\nA tall HOODLUM with gold front teeth is walking by. He is wearing all Polo and a thick white Fila headband. He is biting down on a chew stick.\n\nThe hoodlum walks by. He has a certain ominous strut. He is looking at the ground as he walks. \n\nHe takes the chew stick out of his mouth and looks at some girl's ass as she walks by. He makes a little noise with his mouth.\n\nAs the hoodlum walks by, Casper is rolling backward, not paying attention. He rolls into the hoodlum's heels. Casper falls down and laughs. Everyone watching laughs, including Telly who is still sitting with Misha.\n\nCasper jumps up and grabs his skateboard. The hoodlum is turned around. Casper walks up to him with a smile.\n\nCASPER\nYo, sorry money.\n\nThe hoodlum is a good seven inches taller than Casper. He puts his arms out like he's upset.\n\nHOODLUM\nYeah watch the fuck where you skate. You know what I'm saying?\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nYeah, watch where you walk dukes.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat?\n\nCASPER\nNuffin G. Just forget it.\n\nHOODLUM\nWhat the fuck yo? You wanna catch a beat down?\n\nCasper throws his skateboard down. He quickly turns around and pulls his pants up. He runs right up to the hoodlum and he looks up at him.\n\nCASPER\nSup then? Sup?\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on bitch. Throw your fists up.\n\n\nEXT. THE CEMENT BENCHES - DAY\n\nTelly and Misha are watching. Telly stands up.\n\nTELLY\nUh oh. Casper's in the mix.\n\nHe quickly walks up.\n\n\nEXT. THE FOUNTAIN - DAY\n\nAll the guys jump up and start screaming.\n\nSTEVEN\nOh shit. Throw down.\n\nSteven and all the guys run up and surround the hoodlum. They all start screaming taunts. \"Fuck 'em up Casper!\"\n\nCasper is inches from the hoodlum. They are both in a fighting stance. Casper keeps pulling his pants up. Casper has a huge smile on his face, like this is his favorite thing in the whole world.\n\nCASPER\nSup. Sup.\n\nHOODLUM\nCome on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.\n\nCASPER\nI'm gonna fuck you up bitch.\n\nThey are both right about to swing.\n\nEveryone in the whole park has turned their attention to the scuffle.\n\nAll of a sudden, out of nowhere, Harold runs up behind the Hoodlum and with the truck of his skateboard, smashes the guy in the back of the head. A huge thud is heard and the hoodlum just kinda falls forward on his knees.\n\nCasper, with a big smile, steps back and kicks the guy in the face as hard as he can.\n\nEveryone gets in a big circle around the fallen hoodlum. They're all screaming. Even the girls are screaming. \"Fuck 'em up!\"\n\nHarold continues hitting the hoodlum with his skateboard.\n\nHitting him on the legs and stomach.\n\nCasper is jumping up and down on the hoodlum's head.\n\nCASPER\n(everytime he kicks the guy he says this)\nSuck my dick! Suck my dick! Suck my dick!\n\nAll of a sudden, all the skateboarders in the park, including Hamilton and Steven, take their boards and start smashing this guy, over and over.\n\nThe hoodlum is on the ground holding his head, as everyone frantically tries to kill him.\n\nThe focus should be on the face of the skateboarders. How much they are enjoying this. They continue to pound him, over and over, like animals in on the prey.\n\nThis should look very scary, as twenty guys try to kill the fallen hoodlum. Even little kids are in the middle, beating the guy.\n\nTelly looks up to the sky. He makes a loud noise as he clears his throat, like he's gathering mucus. Then he puts his arms down and stops some of the kids from hitting the hoodlum. His face is completely cracked and bloody. Telly steps over him and spits a huge phlegm wad onto his face.\n\nCasper, still smiling, kicks the guy in the face.\n\nCASPER\nSuck my dick, Suck my dick. Suck my dick.\n\nEveryone stops kicking the guy and they all get kinda silent and look at him. He looks completely twisted, bloody, and dead.\n\nCasper bends over, right in his face.\n\nCASPER\n(smiling)\nNow get in my way! Bitch.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\n\n\nINT. / EXT. TAXICAB - GOING DOWNTOWN - EVENING\n\nJennie is in the back of a speeding cab. She is looking out the window. Her face looks sad.\n\nThe TAXI DRIVER is a funny looking old man. He's wearing a jockey hat and a Hawaiian shirt. He has air fresheners hanging from the mirror. He is chewing on a big wet cigar. He has a half shaved beard. He looks like a dirty old man.\n\nJennie looks dazed.\n\nAs the taxi driver drives, he looks in his mirror at Jennie. He pulls his cigar out of his mouth and then puts it back in.\n\nJazz is playing on the radio.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nExcuse me. Can I ask you a question?\n\nJennie just shrugs.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nCan I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin maybe.\n\nAs the taxi driver talks, he looks in the mirror, and then looks at the road. He is driving fast and clumsy. He pulls out his cigar and then puts it back in his mouth.\n\nJENNIE\nNo. I'm OK. Thanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou're OK?\n\nJENNIE\nYeah.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nBecause gee, you don't look OK. I mean your a very beautiful young lady. It's just that you look troubled that's all...\n\nJENNIE\nYeah well, it's been a bad day.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nA bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.\n\nThe taxi driver begins to laugh a really squeaky laugh.\n\nJENNIE\nSorry.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.\n\nJennie continues to look glumly out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYou know. I could tell you were sad by the way your eyes drooped. Like an adopted kid. That's the way an adopted kid's eyes look. All sad like that. All droopy and sweet. Like the honey that I lick off my finger.\n\nHe starts to laugh. Jennie continues to look sadly out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWould I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?\n\nJennie is silent.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nMiss, would I be prying?\n\nJENNIE\nEverything is wrong.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNo, not everything?

Like a glamour girl.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.\n\nHe stops at a red light and turns around to look at her.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nHey look. Whatever it is. Just forget about it. Life's too short. Make yourself happy. I'll give you an example. When my golden retriever passed away. God rest his soul. \n(he punches the roof of the cab)\nI was lonesome. I missed him. So I got a tattoo.\n\nHe pulls up his shirt and reveals a tattoo of a dog on his forearm. It says \"Bruno\" in big letters.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nNow how do you like that? Now he's with me forever.\n\nThe light turns and he starts driving.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nI swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.\n\nJENNIE\nYeah?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.\n\nJENNIE\nWhat if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, \"Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk\" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.\n\nHe starts to laugh.\n\nA quick shot of his identification badge. He has a really goofy smile and he's wearing the same Hawaiian shirt.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nThat's life.\n\nJennie is smiling.\n\nJENNIE\nYour a real philosopher.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nYeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.\n\nHe pulls up on Washington Square Park. He slams on the brakes and turns around in his seat.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nWell here we are, Miss.\n\nJennie pulls some money out.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAw, don't worry 'bout it. The rides on me.\n\nJennie has the money up to the glass. \n\nTAXI DRIVER\nAll right, all right, I'll take it. But forget about the tip.\n\nHe takes her money.\n\nJENNIE\nThanks. Bye.\n\nThe taxi driver sticks his head out the window.\n\nTAXI DRIVER\nOh yeah. Oh Miss. Miss. When you smile, God notices. That's why the sun is shining.\n\nHe points up to the sky before pulling away.\n\n\nEXT.
