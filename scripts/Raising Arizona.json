The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of \n\tlightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire-topped walls \n\tof a penitentiary.\n\n\tStill bellowing, as if in some primal rage, Gale has gotten \n\this muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing \n\tdown to haul up the rest of his body. It comes with much \n\teffort, and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the \n\tfiercely clinging mud.\n\n\tFinally he is free.\n\n\tWith a great cry, the mud-covered man plunges his right arm \n\tstraight back down into the earth, all the way up to his \n\tshoulder. He gropes intently and then, apparently having \n\tgrabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling.\n\n\tHis arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. Clasped in his \n\thand is - a human foot.\n\n\tBellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the \n\tfoot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head.\n\n\tAs the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head \n\twe see that it is his friend Evelle.\n\n\tBoth are bellowing.\n\n\tMud sucks and pops.\n\n\tThunder crashes.\n\n<b>\tINT.

We hear only the squish - \n\tsuck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen.\n\n\tWe are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent \n\tleather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly \n\tspattered - of several policemen milling about the hole.\n\n\tGerman shepherds sniff around also.\n\n\tWith a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's \n\tjackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police \n\tstep back and dogs skitter away to give him room.\n\n\tHe backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the \n\tbike. The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame; \n\tit hisses angrily and dies in the mud. We start to crane up.\n\n\tThe whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker's motorcycle \n\tidles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun.\n\n\tWe are now framed looking over the Biker's shoulder. The \n\tpolicemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. One cop \n\tin front of him is pointing a direction. The Biker is shaking \n\this head; he doesn't think they went that way.\n\n\tSuddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head \n\tsnaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still, \n\thaving heard, smelled or sensed something.\n\n\tThe dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to \n\tattention, a split second after the BIKER.\n\n<b>\tTHEIR POV\n</b>\n\tA jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field.\n\n<b>\tTHE DOGS\n</b>\n\tAfter a moment, their attention returns to the hole.\n\n<b>\tTHE BIKER\n</b>\n\tHis attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints, \n\tconcentrating. His bike rumbles. Gradually his face sets in \n\ta specific direction.\n\n\tWe pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder: \"Mama Didn't Love \n\tMe.\" His shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the \n\tthrottle; then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of \n\tframe.\n\n<b>\tTRAILER KITCHEN CLOSE ON GALE AND EVELLE\n</b>\n\tThey are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at \n\tsomething offscreen.

The bathroom is quiet except \n\tfor the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching \n\tmotorcycle.

Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet \n\tflailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall \n\tfixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him \n\tloose.
