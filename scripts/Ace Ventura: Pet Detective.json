STREET - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a \npackage in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Good morning, UPS!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">UPS, good to see you!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely \naround and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front \nsteps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package \nbehind him and back down the steps.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. LOBBY - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the \npackage... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts \nkicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of \nAPARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We hear a small dog barking.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">What do you want?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">UPS, sir. And how are you this\nafternoon? Alrighty then!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5\", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A \nsmall Shiatsu stands beside him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">I have a package for you.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The \nman takes the package.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">It sounds broken.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Most likely sir! I bet it was\nsomething nice though! Now... I\nhaver an insurance form. If you'll\njust sign here, here, and here,\nand initial here, and print your name\nhere, we'll get the rest of the\nforms out to you as soon as we\ncan.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see \nthat he likes the UPS guy.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">That's a lovely dog you have. Do\nyou mind if I pet him, sir?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(mumbles)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">I don't give a rat's ass.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(under breath)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Brother.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">That's fine sir. I can fill out\nthe rest. You just have yourself\na good day. Take care, now! 'Bye\n'bye, then!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THRASH MUSIC STARTS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

He passes \nseveral people.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">UPS MAN\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(quickly)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'\nthrough.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. \nThe Gruff Man looks over.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Hey, stupid! Get away from the\ndoor!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">What's the matter with you, I said\n<b>GIT!!!\n</b></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a \nstuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, \"You have been had by Ace Ventura - \nPet Detective.\" He breathes fire.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">GRUFF MAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Son of a bitch!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He smashes the dog to the ground.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head \nsticks out. Ace is gloating.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(announcer's voice)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">That was a close one, ladies and\ngentlemen. Unfortunately, in\nevery contest, there must be...\n<b>A LOOSER!\n</b></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE (CONT'D)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to dog)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">No problem, it gets flooded.\nWe'll just wait a few seconds.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace sits back. SMASH!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Or, we could try it now.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit \nout of it.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Oooh, boy.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ACE'S POV\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Warning!

The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace and his new pal speed away freely.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield \nto Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: \"Reward\" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's \nseat.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THRASH MUSIC ENDS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. HOUSE - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">WOMAN\n </p><p id=\"dia\">My little baby. You missed mommy\ndidn't you?

He's already put two\nof my lovers in the hospital.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">How did he find out?

DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are \npracticing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is \npracticing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">TRAINER\nBlue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone \ndance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake \"kicks\" a perfect field goal. The \nTrainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">DISSOLVE TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly \ntakes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its \njob. Snowflake quickly goes limp.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle \nhas turned into a painful whimper.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free \nhimself.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT.

The cat catches it in mid-air.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ADELLE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Rest in peace.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ADELLE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Well\u0085 here comes another dead\nfish.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Hi, beautiful.

SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a \ncrappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. \nSHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the \ndoor and up the stairs.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him.

Shoot him, now!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MELISSA\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(to cops)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Don't anybody make a move!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the \ncrowd.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed\ncolleague Mr. Marino, has just\nbrought some new evidence to my\nattention. Now, history has\ncertainly shown that even the most\nintuitive criminal minds can be\nwrong, from time to time. But, if\nI have been mistaken\u0085 if the\nlieutenant is indeed a woman\u0085\nthen my friends, she is suffering\nfrom the worst case of hemorrhoids\nI have ever seen!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle \nhas learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FINKLE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(deepest voice possible)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">It was Marino's fault. The laces\nwere in.\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(breaking down now)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">They were IN!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his \nspout.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Somebody read it its rights.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FINKLE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After \na few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">FINKLE\n</p><p id=\"spkdir\">(gasping for air)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Help I can't swim!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side \nof the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We \nsee that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a \nperfect fit.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR\n<b>HERR!!!\n</b></p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">EMILIO\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Melissa\u0085 you can give me back my\ngun now.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Now Aguado appears beside Ace.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">AGUADO\n </p><p id=\"dia\">I don't know how you did it,\nVentura\u0085 but that was damn good\npolice work. Alright guys, let's\nwrap this up!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for\u0085\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">\u0085Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their \nheads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">HIGH ANGLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire \nright in the middle.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARINO (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">hey Ace?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah, Dan?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MARINO (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Got any more gum?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">CUT TO:\n</p><p></p><p id=\"slug\">INT. STADIUM - DAY\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is \ndrooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the \nawesome spectacle.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Some fireworks go off around the tank. A  marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a \nhelicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami\nDolphins are proud to welcome back\nto BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our\nbeloved mascot and star of the\nhalftime show\u0085\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANGLE ON\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Snowflake!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing \nspectacular flips, they kiss.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ANOTHER ANGLE\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the \nforeground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and \nshoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">You idiot! Do you know what\nyou've done?!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MASCOT\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Huh?\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace grabs him.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">You just cost me ten thousand\nbucks, Polly!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">MASCOT\n </p><p id=\"dia\">Yeah Blow me.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ACE\n </p><p id=\"dia\">REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot \nof finger pointing.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANNOUNCER\n </p><p id=\"dia\">The National Football League would\nnow like to offer a special thank\nyou to the man who rescued Dan\nMarino and our beloved\nSnowflake\u0085\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"speaker\">ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\n </p><p id=\"dia\">A great humanitarian, and lover of\nall animals\u0085 Mr. Ace Ventura!\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he \nlooks into camera with his fist raised.\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">MUSIC UP: THRASH METAL\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">ROLL CREDITS\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">THE END\n</p><p></p><p id=\"act\">(LOKI NOTE: My copy of this script has the bloody end of Vinnie and Roc physically crossed out \nby three black marker lines, presumably by the authors.
