STREET - DAY\nA UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a \npackage in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.\nUPS MAN\n Good morning, UPS!\nHe tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.\nUPS MAN\n UPS, good to see you!\nHe takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely \naround and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.\nUPS MAN\n Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\nThe UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front \nsteps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package \nbehind him and back down the steps.\nHe goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.\nINT. LOBBY - DAY\nSeveral people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the \npackage... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.\nINT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY\nELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts \nkicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of \nAPARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.\nWe hear a small dog barking.\nGRUFF MAN (O.S.)\n Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!\nAn angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.\nGRUFF MAN\n What do you want?\nUPS MAN\n UPS, sir. And how are you this\nafternoon? Alrighty then!\nThe man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5\", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A \nsmall Shiatsu stands beside him.\nUPS MAN\n I have a package for you.\nThe UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The \nman takes the package.\nGRUFF MAN\n It sounds broken.\nUPS MAN\n Most likely sir! I bet it was\nsomething nice though! Now... I\nhaver an insurance form. If you'll\njust sign here, here, and here,\nand initial here, and print your name\nhere, we'll get the rest of the\nforms out to you as soon as we\ncan.\nThe man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see \nthat he likes the UPS guy.\nUPS MAN\n That's a lovely dog you have. Do\nyou mind if I pet him, sir?\nGRUFF MAN\n(mumbles)\n I don't give a rat's ass.\nThe UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.\nUPS MAN\n Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!\nGRUFF MAN\n(under breath)\n Brother.\nBefore the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.\nUPS MAN\n That's fine sir. I can fill out\nthe rest. You just have yourself\na good day. Take care, now! 'Bye\n'bye, then!\nTHRASH MUSIC STARTS\nINT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D\nThe UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.\nINT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D\nThe Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D\nThe UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes \nseveral people.\nUPS MAN\n(quickly)\n UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'\nthrough.\nINT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D\nWe see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. \nThe Gruff Man looks over.\nGRUFF MAN\n Hey, stupid! Get away from the\ndoor!\nThe dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.\nGRUFF MAN\n What's the matter with you, I said\nGIT!!!\nHe roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a \nstuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, \"You have been had by Ace Ventura - \nPet Detective.\" He breathes fire.\nGRUFF MAN\n Son of a bitch!\nHe smashes the dog to the ground.\nEXT. ALLEY - CONT'D\nAs the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head \nsticks out. Ace is gloating.\nACE\n(announcer's voice)\n That was a close one, ladies and\ngentlemen. Unfortunately, in\nevery contest, there must be...\nA LOOSER!\nHe jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.\nACE (CONT'D)\n LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!\nHe then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.\nHe tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.\nACE\n(to dog)\n No problem, it gets flooded.\nWe'll just wait a few seconds.\nAce sits back. SMASH!!!\nFrom Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.\nACE\n Or, we could try it now.\nAce frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit \nout of it.\nACE\n Oooh, boy.\nACE'S POV\nWe see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.\nACE\n Warning! Assholes are closer than\nthey appear!\nThe dog is barking insanely.\nACE\n(to dog)\n You think you can do better?!\nThe baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.\nACE\n Wanna give me a push while you're\nback there?\nBOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.\nACE\n FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!\nAce leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.\nEXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY\nAce and his new pal speed away freely.\nClose on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield \nto Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.\nThe car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: \"Reward\" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's \nseat.\nTHRASH MUSIC ENDS\nINT. HOUSE - DAY\nA very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.\nWOMAN\n My little baby. You missed mommy\ndidn't you? Did daddy hurt you?\nI won't let him, no I won't. He\nmay have kept the big screen TV,\nbut he's not gonna keep my baby.\nNo he isn't.\n(very sexy to Ace)\n Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I\never repay you?\nShe slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.\nACE\n Well, the reward would be good,\nand there was some damage to my \u0096\nShe cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.\nWOMAN\n Would you like me to take you\npants off instead?\nACE\n Ummmm\u0085 Sure.\nShe pulls him toward the bedroom.\nWOMAN\n It takes a big man to stand up to\nmy husband. He's already put two\nof my lovers in the hospital.\nACE\n How did he find out? Does he have\nyou followed.\nWOMAN\n No\u0085 I tell him\nShe plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.\nEXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY\nThe stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are \npracticing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.\nBehind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is \npracticing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.\nTRAINER\nBlue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!\nSnowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone \ndance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.\nThe Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake \"kicks\" a perfect field goal. The \nTrainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT\nThe stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.\nSuddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.\nThe rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.\nThey slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.\nSnowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly \ntakes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.\nQuick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its \njob. Snowflake quickly goes limp.\nSnowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle \nhas turned into a painful whimper.\nThe truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free \nhimself.\nINT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY\nClose up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE \nROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in \na bag to JENNIFER,  a very sweet nine year old.\nADELLE\n Here you go, honey. Now\nremember\u0085 this kind of fish\ndoesn't like it in the freezer.\nJENNY\n But what's gonna happen to Dolly?\nADELLE\n Don't worry, I'll make sure she\ngets a proper burial.\nJennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air.\nADELLE\n Rest in peace.\nAce enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes.\nADELLE\n Well\u0085 here comes another dead\nfish.\nACE\n Hi, beautiful. What time do you\nget off?\nADELLE\n Uh oh.\nACE\n(suggestively)\n I've heard some pretty great\nthings about your kibble.\nADELLE\n Well, I hope I'm not getting a\nreputation.\nACE\n(switching to mock anger)\n Just get me the food!\nShe chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food.\nADELLE\n So\u0085 ahh, when can I expect you\nto pay your tab?\nACE\n I'm a little bit Sli  Pickins,\nright now, I'm a little Tight\nSqueeze Louise, a little Welfare\nWolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm\nah \u0096\nADELLE\n If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'.\nJust take it.\nACE\n Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle.\nI'm on a very big case right now.\nAce reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon.\nACE\n See this pigeon? It's a true\nalbino. Some rich guy lost it.\nHe's offering a ten thousand\ndollar reward.\nADELLE\n Wow, albino pigeons are very\nrare. How are you going to find\nhim?\nACE\n Just keep my eyes open, and hope\nto god it doesn't snow.\nAce grabs his bags and heads for the door.\nADELLE\n You're a good boy, Ace. A good\nboy.\nHe holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman \nis walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the \nfloor. Ace and Adelle just stare.\nELDERLY MAN\n(in a loud voice)\n Do you have anything for ringworm?\nEXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY\nAce enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a \ncrappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. \nSHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the \ndoor and up the stairs.\nEXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY\nAce is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by \nthe dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST).\nLANDLORD\n Venturaaaaa?\nAce straightens up, but doesn't turn around.\nACE\n Yes, Satan?\nNow Ace turns around in mock surprise.\nACE\n Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded\nlike someone else.\nLANDLORD\n Never mind the wise cracks\nVenturaaa. You owe me rent!\nACE\n Mr. Shickadance\u0085 I told you,\nyou're my first priority! As soon\nas I find the white pigeon,\nyou're paid!!\nLANDLORD\n I heard animals in there Ventura!\nI heard 'em again this morning,\nscratchin' around.\nACE\n I never bring my work home with\nme, sir.\nThe landlord notices the bags of kibble.\nLANDLORD\n Oh, yeah? What's all this pet\nfood for?\nACE\n(beat)\n Fiber.\nThe landlord isn't buying it.\nACE\n You wanna take a look for\nyourself? Go head.\nAce rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. \nAce walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air.\nACE\n Well\u0085 are you satisfied?\nLANDLORD\n(still suspicious)\n Yeah, but don't ever let me catch\nyou with an animal in there,\nthat's all!\nACE\n Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye\n'bye.\nThe landlord walks away as Ace closes the door.\nACE\n(quietly to himself)\n LLOOSER.\nHe then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle.\nCHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly \nthrough the air, all of them gravitating to Ace.\nACE\n(to his flock)\n Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo!\nINT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY\nThe very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a \ntake charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, \nan ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant.\nRIDDLE\n I just want to know one thing; How\nthe hell do you lose a 500 pound\nfish?!\nMelissa's about to speak but hesitates.\nRIDDLE (CONT.)\n What?\nMELISSA\n It's not a fish, sir. It's a\nmammal.\nAn angry Riddle stands up.\nRIDDLE\n Oh, thank you very much, Mrs.\nJacque Cousteau!\nPODACTER\n Bob, she didn't mean anything by\nit.\nRIDDLE calms down a little, and sits.\nRIDDLE\n(calmer)\n Listen, personally, I don't give a\ngood god damn about a fish.\nHe looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything.\nRIDDLE (CONT.)\n All I care about is winning this\nSuper Bowl! I want the players'\nhead in the right place. Shit,\nRoger, you've been in this game\nlong enough, you know how\nsuperstitious players are. Our\nquarterback's been putting his\nsocks on backwards since high\nschool. And I got a lineman who\nhasn't washed his jock in two\nyears because he thinks flies are\nlucky! I want that god damn fish\non the field Super Bowl Sunday!\nFIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS!\nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION\nAn upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway.\nPODACTER\n Why did it have to happen now? I\ngot three stinking years left till\nretirement.\nMELISSA\n I've got forty.\nPODACTER\n I'll tell you who did it. It was\nthose goddamn animal rights nuts!\nAlways out there with their\ngoddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORN\nFREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE!\nThat goddamn fish lives better than\nthey do!\nThey stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk.\nMELISSA\n The police are checking into the\nanimal rights people.\n(to secretary)\n Martha, have the police called\nback about the dolphin yet?\nMARTHA\n No, but I wanted to tell you, when\nI lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet\ndetective.\nPODACTER\n A what?\nMARTHA\n A pet detective.\nMELISSA\n Thanks Martha, but we'd better\nleave this to professionals.\nMARTHA\n Well actually, he was quite good.\nPet detection is a very involved,\nhighly scientific process.\nCUT TO:\nEXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME\nCLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the \nroof of a two story building. He is four feet away from \"The\" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a \nmad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird.\nACE\n AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!\nThe bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the \nbuilding and slides down the side of the roof.\nEXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION\nBAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off.\nEXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY\nParking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him.\nINT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY\nA stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection \nwand.\nMAN #1\n Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies.\nThe guard scans him. He goes.\nMAN #2\n Tom Anderson. Concessions.\nThe guard scans him. He goes.\nACE\n Ace Ventura. Pet detective.\nThe guard stares at Ace, accusingly.\nINT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY\nMartha enters.\nMARTHA\n Ah\u0085 Mr. Ventura to see you.\nMELISSA\n Okay, send him in.\nMartha exits, Ace enters.\nMELISSA (CONT'D)\n Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you\nhave any trouble getting in?\nACE\n No, the guy with the rubber glove\nwas surprisingly gentle.\nMELISSA\n(apologetically)\n Super Bowl week. Security's\ntight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get\nright to the point\u0085\nShe slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit.\nMELISSA\n Our mascot was stolen from his\ntank last night. Are you familiar\nwith Snowflake?\nThe tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out \nsignals.\nTRAINER (ON TAPE)\nBlue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!\nSnowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of \nthe pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer.\nMELISSA (O.S.)\n We got Snowflake from the Miami\nSeaquarium. He's a rare Bottle\nNose Dolphin. That's the new\ntrick he was going to do during\nthe half-time show.\nWhile Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a \nneat little pile on her desk.\nMELISSA\n Would you like an ashtray?\nACE\n No, I don't smoke.\nHe adds more shells to the pile.\nMelissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake.\nMELISSA\n To be honest, Mr. Ventura.\nI'm pretty skeptical. Before\ntoday, I didn't even know there\nwas such a thing as a pet\ndetective.\nACE\n Well, now that you do, you'll know\nwho to call if your Schnauser ever\nruns away.\nMELISSA\n How did you know I have a\nSchnauser?\nAce pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her.\nACE\n He's young, about five pounds,\nblack coat, white speckles\u0085\n(sniffs the hair)\n \u0085likes to chase cars.\nMELISSA\n Very impressive.\nACE\n You should see what I can do with\na good stool sample.\nMELISSA\n I can hardly wait. Look, we've\ngot a problem. Can you help me or\nnot?\nACE\n(coy)\n Well, sea faring creatures aren't\nreally my expertise\u0085\nMELISSA\n We'll give you three thousand\ndollars on delivery.\nAce immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show.\nACE\n The dolphin is a social creature.\nCapable of complex communication.\nTraveling in large groups or\nschools\u0085\nEXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER\nThe Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino.\nMARINO\n We just choked in 82. We had a\nchance to win it and we didn't.\nNobody's gonna choke this time,\nand if they do, I'll kill 'em.\nAce and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank.\nMELISSA\n The police were here this morning.\nApparently, the kidnappers used\nthe back gate.\nAce bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field.\nMELISSA (CONT'D)\n They said some kind of a \u0096\nACE\n Four wheel drive van\u0085 loaded from\nthe rear.\nAce sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously.\nMELISSA\n Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holding\nup?\nPODACTER\n Well if it looks like I'm walking\nfunny it's because I have a bunch\non reporters up my ass. They've\nbeen asking me about Snowflake all\nday. Who's this?\nMELISSA\n Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura.\nAce is our pet detective.\nPodacter shakes his hand.\nPODACTER\n Nice to meet you. Martha Metz\nrecommended you very highly.\nACE\n Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh\nyeah, the bitch.\nPODACTER\n What?\nACE\n Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in\nHighland Park area. She was half\ndead when I found her. Is that\nthe tank?\nThey both follow Ace as he makes a B-line.\nEXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER\nThe tank is empty.\nACE\n Cops drain it?\nMELISSA\n Yes. This morning.\nAce hops on the ladder.\nACE\n If I'm not back in five\nminutes\u0085 call Lloyd Bridges.\nINT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER\nWhile eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where \nthe hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a \nbastardized version of the theme from, \"Flipper.\"\nACE\n \u0085Wonderful Flipper\u0085 glorious\nFlipper\u0085 magnificent\nFlipper\u0085 The flippiest Flipper\u0085\nPodacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, \"What have we gotten \nourselves into?\" Podacter spots something.\nPODACTER\n Oh, great.\nA hoard or reporters are headed their way.\nPODACTER (CONT)\n I'll try to head them off.\nMELISSA\n(to Ace)\n Get out of the tank.\nACE\n(still singing)\n \u0085Can't hear you Flipper,\nFlipper\u0085 Lookin' for Flipper,\ngotta find Flipper\u0085\nMELISSA\n I said, get out of the tank! Now!\nThe reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off.\nREPORTER\n So where's Snowflake?\nPODACTER\n Ah\u0085 Snowflake is just, ah, not\navailable right now.\nREPORTER\n Come on, I'm supposed to get a\nshot of his new trick for the\nevening news.\nREPORTER #2\n What? Is he sick?\nOther reporters chime in.\nVARIOUS REPORTERS\nDid something happen to\nSnowflake?! What're you\nhiding..?!\nMelissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard.\nACE/HEINZ (O.S.)\n(unrecognizable accent)\n How cun I be getting dis vork dun\nmit all da shouting? What for is\ndis shouting?\nREPORTER\n Who the hell is that?\nMELISSA\n That? That's\u0085\nACE/HEINZ\n Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of\nDolphins.

Do you have a dorsal\nfin?\n(beat)\n To train ze dolphin, you must zink\nlike ze dolphin. You must be\ngetting oonside ze dolphin's head!\nJust yesterday I'm asking\nSnowflake\u0085 \"ee, eee, eee.\" He\nsaid, \"Eee, eee, eee, eee.\" Und\nyou can quote him.\nAce spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in.\nPODACTER\n Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula's\npress conference is just about to\nbegin. Why don't I take you over\nthere and let, ah, Heinz, do his\njob.\nHe ushers the press away.\nMELISSA\n(sotto to Ace)\n Are you finished, Heinz?\nACE\n Not yet.\nAce goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents \u0096 mainly leaves, small \ntwigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself.\nACE\n Now I'm finished.\nEXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY\nA flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by \nthe obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO.\nAGUADO\n Hey, Ventura! Make any good\ncollars lately?\nANOTHER COP\nOr were they leashes?\nThey all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground.\nAGUADO\n Uh oh.\n(steps on the bug)\n Homicide, Ventura!\nThe cops are falling all over themselves laughing.\nAGUADO\n How you gonna solve this one?!\nAce walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug.\nACE\n Good question, Aguado\u0085 first I'd\nestablish a motive. In this case\nthe killer saw the size of the\nbug's dick, and became insanely\njealous.\nThe other cops all react with a big \"ooooooo\". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face \nwith him.\nACE\n Then I'd lose thirty pounds\nporking his wife.\nAguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace.\nWith a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead \nbug.\nACE\n Now kiss and make up.\nAce walks off.\nACE\n(to himself)\n LLLOOOSER!\nAce walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide \ndivision. Ace has a silly impish look on his face.\nACE\n(playfully)\n I miss you.\nEMILIO\n It's not a good time, Ace. If\nEinhorn sees me talking to you I'm\ngonna be history.\nACE\n Okay. Just tell me what you got\non Snowflake. That's all I need.\nEMILIO\n \u0085I can't say anything. My hands\nare tied.\nACE\n(effeminate)\nSounds like my kind of a party.\nA cop comes to Emilio's desk.\nCOP\nLook alive, Einhorn's on her way\ndown.\nEMILIO\n Ace, please?!\nACE\n Just tell me who's working the\ncase?\nEMILIO\n Aguado.\nACE\n Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He's\nthe poster child for lead paint\nchip eaters!\nEMILIO\n Look, Ace. We're a little busy\nwith murderers and drug dealers.\nA missing dolphin isn't exactly a\nhigh priority.\nThe elevator is getting closer.\nEMILIO\n Ace, gimme a break will ya?\nAce nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly.\nEMILIO\n(quickly)\n Okay, okay. We checked all the\nlocal animal rights groups,\ntaxidermists, and we're running a\ncheck through DMV on all recent\nvan rentals. So far, nada.\nACE\n Any unusual bets being made?\nEMILIO\n Ace, it's the Super Bowl, of\ncourse there's bets being made.\nACE\n What'd you find out about the\ntank?\nEMILIO\n Nothing weird. Just the tire\ntracks and the exit route. The\nguard didn't see anything.\nACE\n That's it?\nEMILIO\n That's it. I swear. Now please\ngo away!\nACE\n You know something?\n(again impish)\n YOU'RE NICE!\nAce gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in.\nACE\n What about crazy Philly fans?\nThe elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a \ngreat pair of legs and a bad tude.\nACE\n Holy Testicle Tuesday!\nEINHORN\n(to Emilio)\n What the hell is he doing here?\nACE\n I came to confess. I was the\nsecond gunman on the grassy knoll.\nEINHORN\n Spare me the routine, Ventura. I\nknow you're working the Snowflake\ncase. May I suggest you yield to\nthe experts on this one? We'll\nfind the porpoise.\nACE\n(mock relief)\n Whewww\u0085 now I feel better!\nAce turns to go.\nACE (CONT)\n Of course, that might not do any\ngood. You see, nobody's missing a\nporpoise. It's a dolphin that's\nbeen taken. The common Harbor\nPorpoise has an abrupt snout,\npointed teeth, and a triangular\nthorasic fin, while the Bottlenose\nDolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus,\nhas an elongated beak, round,\ncone-shaped teeth, and a\ndistinctive serrated dorsal\nappendage. (beat) But I'm sure\nyou already knew that. (beat)\nThat's what turns me on about you.\nHey\u0085 maybe I'll give you a call\nsometime, lieutenant. Your number\nstill 911? Alrighty then!\nAce exits.\nCUT TO:\nINT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT\nA wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the \nmoshing pit.\nAce enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music.\nACE\n(shouting)\n Excuse me?! Is Greg here?!\nThe burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace.\nACE\n Thank you!\nAce heads for the basement stairs.\nINT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT\nAce descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is \nheard from inside.\nVOICE (O.S.)\n Password!\nACE\n Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You can\ntoo!\nCLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open.\nINT. BASEMENT - NIGHT\nAce enters. Green Peace \"Save the Whales\" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid \nback, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have \ntheir own distinct banter.\nA thud from above. Ace looks up.\nACE'S POV\nPart of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's \nface gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club.\nACE\n(to burnout)\n Found him!\nWOODSTOCK\n Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin?\nACE\n Super, and thank you for asking.\nHope you're having a nice day.\nWOODSTOCK\n Do you?\nACE\n Don't I? And what are you up to?\nWOODSTOCK\n Just watching the fishies, man.\nThere is a BLIP on the computer screen.\nWOODSTOCK\n Alright, you're just in time for\nthe party. You see those blips?\nACE\n I certainly do.\nON THE SCREEN\nA map with several ships on the ocean.\nHe quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions.\nWOODSTOCK\n That's a Norwegian whaling fleet.\nI'm sending them new directional\ncoordinates\u0085 They'll find Jimmy\nHoffa before they find any\nHumpbacks.\nACE\n Gravy.\nWoodstock moves to a different screen.\nWOODSTOCK\n Check this out.\nMore computer graphics come up on the screen.\nWOODSTOCK\n Just changed the formula for\nPurina's puppy chow.\n(turns to Ace)\n Too much filler, don't ya' think?\nACE\n(acting turned on)\n I'm very attracted to you right\nnow.\nWoodstock chuckles.\nWOODSTOCK\n Are you?\nACE\n Aren't I? Can you still tap into\nall the aquatic supply store in\nthe area?\nWOODSTOCK\n Of course I can. Why?\nACE\n I want to trace the sale of any\nequipment for transporting or\nhousing a dolphin within the past\nfew months\u0085\nWOODSTOCK\n C'mon, Ace. I thought you might\nhave a challenge for me\u0085\nWoodstock starts hacking away.\nACE\n Okay then, try to remember the\nsixties.\nWOODSTOCK\n Wow! God one! Let's see\u0085\nMarine winch sling, feeder fish,\n20,000 gallon tank\u0085\nHe waits. We hear a beep.\nWOODSTOCK\n That's it. I found the culprit.\nACE\n Who is it?\nWOODSTOCK\n(dramatically)\n \u0085Sea World.\nACE\n \u0085bastard.\nWOODSTOCK\n Hang on, hang on\u0085\n(He taps a couple keys)\n Well, what do we have here?\nThat's a lot of equipment for a\ncivilian.\nThe printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace.\nACE\n Ronald Camp? The billionaire?\nWOODSTOCK\n Billionaire and rare fish\ncollector.\nACE\n RRREHEHEALLY!\nA PICTURE OF CAMP\nComes up on the computer screen.\nWOODSTOCK\n That, my friend, is the face of\nthe enemy.\nHe pages through his file on screen.\nWOODSTOCK\n \u0085Always tryin' to get his hands\non endangered species\u0085\nNewspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players.\nACE\n Hold on, this guy's connected with\nthe Dolphins?\nAce leans in.\nWOODSTOCK\n Camp donated the land the new\nstadium's built on.\n(re: article)\n Oh, look at this, he's throwin'\nanother, \"I'm the richest man in\nthe universe\" party.\nACE\n(thinking)\n Hmmm\u0085 I wonder if I can find\nmyself a date.\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT\nIt's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people \nhaving champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him.\nDAN\n We just choked in 82. We had a\nchance to win and we didn't. But\nnobody's gonna choke this time; if\nthey do, I'll kill 'em!\nEverybody laughs.\nEXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT\nAce and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion.\nMELISSA\n I'm really going out on a limb\nhere, Ventura. Camp's social\nevents are strictly A-list.\nACE\n(a la Love Connection)\n 'Well, Chuck\u0085 the date started\noff good, but just before we got\nto the party, she seemed to tense\nup.'\nMelissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker.\nMELISSA\n I swear, if you do anything to\nembarrass me in front of Camp\u0085\nACE\n You mean like this?\nAce starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like \nGavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse.\nACE\n Owwwe!!!\nHe sees the butler.\nACE\n Oh, hi Captain Stubing.\nMelissa storms in, already pissed.\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT\nAce and Melissa enter. Camp looks over.\nCAMP\n Melissa! Glad you could make it!\nOh, and who is this?\nMELISSA\n This is my date. He's a\u0085\nlawyer.\nCAMP\n Well, does he have a name, or\nshould I call him \"Lawyer\"?\nMELISSA\n I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace.\nAce is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in.\nACE\n Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you,\nMr. Camp, and congratualtions on\nall your success. You smell\nterrific.\nCAMP\n Ah, well, thank you. Please, come\nin.\nAce boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows.\nMELISSA\n(sotto)\n This is insane. There's no way\nthat Camp stole Snowflake.\nACE\n(spreading pate' on a cracker)\n Will you just keep him occupied,\nwhile I work my magic please.\nShe crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux \nbeside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker.\nACE\n(with a mouthful, to man)\n Smooshy, isn't it?\nOff the stuffy man's reaction\u0085\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER\nAce approaches Camp.\nACE\n Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the\nbathroom?\n(palms his stomach, whispering loudly)\n I think it's the pate'.\nCAMP\n Um, it's just over there.\nACE\n Thanks. Stuff probably looks\nbetter on the way out, huh?\nAce laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom.\nINT. BATHROOM - CONT\nAce wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens \nand climbs out a window.\nEXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT\nAce drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time \nquietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'.\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT\nAce browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled \nwith colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He \ncontinues on towards a large door.\nINT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER\nA huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the \nlarge door and enters.\nACE\n Gravy.\nAce climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a \nnarrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks \ncarefully out there.\nCLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT.\nHe looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and \ndangles the fish over the water.\nACE\n(gently)\n Snowflake\u0085 Here, Snowflake\u0085\nSnooowflaaaake\u0085\nA GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH \nFROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED.\nHe reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water.\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME\nMelissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches.\nCAMP\n Wonderful, aren't they?\nMELISSA\n(nervously)\n Yes. They're incredible.\nCAMP\n No matter what is going on in my\nlife, I can always watch them\nswim and be completely at peace.\nINT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME\nThe water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface.\nACE\n(frantic, to himself)\n It's not Snowflake\u0085 It's not\nSnowflake.\nInstantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the \npool.\nACE\n(screaming)\n IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOT\nSNOWFLAAAA!!!\nINT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER\nA line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious.\nCAMP\n Are you sure he's okay? It's been\nan awfu;;y long time.\nMELISSA\n Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine.\nAce suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, \nwith his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement.\nACE\n(loudly to the entire room)\n DO NOT GO IN THERE!\n(fanning the air)\n Whewww!!\nEXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER\nAce and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway.\nCAMP\n(still confused)\n I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll\nhave the pluming checked\nimmediately.\nACE\n Be sure that you do. If I had\nbeen drinking out of that toilet,\nI might have been killed!\nAce shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, \ncommemorative ring.\nCamp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away.\nMELISSA\n We'd better go.\nCamp looks on and shakes his head.\nINT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT\nAce is thinking. Melissa is pissed.\nMELISSA\n \u0085Y'know, I don't even want to\nknow why your pants are missing!\nI don't care what happened! You\ncould have cost me my job.\nACE\n(on his own wavelength)\n I was wrong about Camp. He's\nbreaking the law but he's not our\nguy.\nMELISSA\n It's a sure thing! It's\ndefinitely him! Just get me in\nthere! Let me work my magic!\nAce takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely.\nACE\n This is the key. Right here!\nMELISSA\n Hiring you was the biggest mistake\nI ever made!\nACE\n So small! So unnoticeable! Yet\nan invaluable piece\u0085 of our\ntwisted little jigsaw puzzle!\nMelissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa \nswerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search \nfor it frantically.\nACE\n Damn it!\n(to Melissa)\n Try to keep it on the road.\nINT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM\nMelissa enters, followed by Ace.\nMELISSA\n So, you found a pebble in\nSnowflake's tank. Excuse me while\nI call CNN.\nACE\n I found it in the filter. And\nit's not a pebble. It is a rare,\ntriangular cut, orange amber.\nAce hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases.\nMELISSA\n What are you talking about?\nACE\n Tonight I saw the exact same stone\nin Camp's ring.\nAce finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it.\nMELISSA\n I thought you said he didn't do\nit.\nACE\n N. Camp's clean. His ring\nwasn't missing a stone. But\nwhoever was in that tank had a\nring just like his.\nMELISSA\n Wait a second. What ring?\nAce hands her the book. It's open to a photo of\u0085\nACE\n The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship\nring.\nMelissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match.\nACE\n I find the ring with the missing\nstone, I find Snowflake.\nMELISSA\n How are you gonna do that?\nACE\n Simple.\nMUSIC UP\nCUT TO:\nEXT. TRACK - DAY\nAce is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running \naround the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a \nglimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going.\nINT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY\nAce sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down \nseveral shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring.\nCLOSE ON\nA poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out.\nEXT. HOTEL - DAY\nPan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and \nlooking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings.\nEXT. TRACK - DAY\nAce is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man \nleaves him in the dust.\nINT. SPORTS BAR - DAY\nTwo big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time \npreparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the \"go ahead\" nod. He \nis instantly thrown across the room.\nCLOSE ON\nThe poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out.\nEXT. STREET\nAce spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring.\nAce deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see \nhis ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off.\nINT. MEN'S ROOM\nOne huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a \nglimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it \nchanges to a \"come on\" smile.\nCLOSE ON\nThe poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it.\nEXT. TRACK - DAY\nOnce again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, \nwith a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the \nman's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up \nthe fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed.\nEXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING\nAce sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him.\nMELISSA\n Ace, that stone could have come\nfrom anywhere. An earring, a\nnecklace\u0085\nACE\n(with murder in his eyes)\n It came from an '82 AFC\nChampionship ring.\nMELISSA\n Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an\nanimal rights group. Have you\nheard of FAN?\nACE\n Free Animals Now? Started in 1982\nby Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the\nfamous industrialist, Fischer\nGamble? Over half a million\nmembers from Florida to Finland?\n(beat)\n No. Who are they?\nMELISSA\n Did you know that last year they\nsent threatening letters to 127\ncollege teams, demanding the\nrelease of their mascots? At last\ncount \u0096\nACE\n What do you feed your dog?\nWe see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet.\nMELISSA\n Ah\u0085 dog food, why?\nACE\n He's miserable.\nMELISSA\n What are you talking about?\nACE\n He's just very unhappy, I feel\nsorry for him. Bad diet, isolated\nenvironment. It's amazing he's\nstill alive.\nMELISSA\n You're just mad because your\nstupid pebble theory didn't work\nout and you don't know how to\nexpress your anger.\nACE\n Yeah? And you're ugly.\nMELISSA\n I'm not even gonna' talk to you,\nplease leave.\nACE\n What, so you can beat him? Fatty!\nMELISSA\n You\u0085 are unbelievable.\nThe phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it.\nMELISSA\n Hiring you was a huge mistake!\nThe door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we \nall see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world.\nACE\n You like her, huh?\u0085 Yeah, she's\nalright.\nAce, feeling guilty, walks into the house.\nINT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT\nAce walks toward Melissa.\nACE\n Look, Melissa, I, ah\u0085\nAce stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely \nstunned look on her face. Something is very wrong.\nEXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nChaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people.\nAce and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance.\nACE\n You okay?\nMelissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them.\nACE\n What'd you find?\nEMILIO\n Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide.\nHe was alone. He'd been drinking.\nNo sign of a struggle. Neighbor\nheard him scream on the way down.\nJust your classic fifteen story\nswan dive.\nMelissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a \"way to go\" look.\nEMILIO\n Sorry.\nINT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT\nThe three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator.\nMELISSA\n It just seems so out of character.\nHe was going to retire in two\nyears.\nACE\n Did he leave a note?\nThe elevator arrives.\nEMILIO\n No. That's nothing unusual. Some\ndo, some don't. He didn't.\nThe elevator doors close.\nINT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER\nPolice are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of \nthe officers.\nEMILIO\n Miss Robinson, this is officer\nCarlson.\nCARLSON\nEvening, ma'am. I wonder if you\ncould answer a few questions about\nthe deceased?\nAce slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations.\nNEIGHBOR\n(to a cop)\n I told you, I was across the hall\nin my apartment, I heard a scream.\nThe door was locked, so I called\nthe manager\u0085\nThe Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old.\nMANAGER\n \u0085The place was empty, except for\nthe damn dog in the other room.\nThen I opened the balcony door,\nlooked over the railing,\nand\u0085 splat, bang, pancake time\u0085\nAce, continuing his investigation notices\u0085\nPODACTER'S DESK\nin perfect order.\nNext, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting \nout the noise.\nINT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nA dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy.\nACE\n Hey, fella, have a bad night?\nAce examines its paws.\nAce then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt.\nAce stands. He is face to face with Einhorn.\nEINHORN\n Who let Dr. Doolittle in?\nEmilio steps in immediately.\nEMILIO\n Ah, Lieutenant. He came with Miss\nRobinson \u0096\nEINHORN\n This is official police business.\nWe'll let you know if the coroner\nfinds any ticks.\nCops snicker.\nEMILIO\n I just thought since Melissa \u0096\nACE\n E, forget it. She's right.\nBesides, I wouldn't want someone\ntracing my steps and pointing out\nall the mistakes I made.\nAce crosses to\u0085\nEXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT\nAce examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit.\nEINHORN\n Oh, so, you don't think this in an\nobvious suicide, Mr. Pet\nDetective?\nACE\n Well, I wouldn't say that. Lord\nknows, there is plenty of evidence\nhere to support your theory,\nexcept of course that spot of\nblood on the balcony.\nOn the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood.\nEinhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down.\nACE\n May I tell you what I think\nhappened? Alrighty then!\nAce moves as he talks.\nACE\n Roger Podacter went out after\nwork. He had a few drinks, and he\ncame home. But he wasn't alone. \nSomeone was with him in this\napartment. There was a struggle,\nand then Roger Podacter was thrown\nover that balcony. Roger Podacter\ndidn't commit suicide. He was\nmurdered.\nA beat as everyone considers this.\nEINHORN\n Well, that's a very entertaining\nstory, but real detectives have to\nworry about that little thing\nlawyers call evidence.\nAce picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host.\nACE\n Let's take a trip to clue\ncorner, shall we? Can anyone tell\nme why a man buys a lottery ticket\non the day he is going to commit\nsuicide? Or why the family pet,\nsuffering from acute canine\ntrauma, clawed at the bedroom door\nuntil his paws bled? How about\nthe blood on the railing? I'll\nbet if we put our thinking caps on\nwe'll see that it was the result\nof the struggle that took place\ninside this apartment while Mr.\nPodacter was still alive!\n(singing)\n NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE\nCOME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP!\nEveryone looks to Einhorn.\nEINHORN\n Not a bad try for a pet detective,\nbut not near conclusive enough for\nus real investigators.\n(beat)\n First, people buy lottery tickets\neveryday. It's a habit. It\ndoesn't prove a thing. Second,\nthe dog wasn't suffering from\ncanine trauma, he was suffering\nfrom bladder trauma. Sergeant\nNeilson found a piss stain as big\nas Lake Huron near the bed. And\nthird, the blood on the railing.\nSimple. He doesn't jump far\nenough and whacks his head. A\nfact confirmed by the paramedics\nwho found cuts on his scalp, with\ntraces of a white chalky\nsubstance. i.e. plaster from the\nbalcony.\nEinhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn.\nEINHORN\n So much for your murder, Ventura.\nAGUADO\n Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet\nflush. Maybe someone lost their\nturtle?\nEveryone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten.\nACE\n Well, maybe I'm just a little out\nof my league, here. Einhorn\u0085\nAce holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it.\nACE\n \u0085good work.\nAce and Melissa head for the door.\nACE\n Oh, there is just one more thing,\nLieutenant.\n(re: the neighbor)\n This man is Roger Podacter's\nneighbor. He lives across the\nhall. He said he heard a scream,\nis that right, sir?\nThe neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager.\nACE\n And you said you had to open the\nbalcony door when you keyed into\nthe room?\nMANAGER\n That's right.\nAce walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them.\nACE\n You're certain you had to open\nthis door?\nShe nods.\nEINHORN\n What's the point, Ventura?\nACE\n Only this\u0085\nAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW\u0085\nAce sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door \nbetween them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard.\nACE\n(tapping the door)\n This is double paned, sound-\nproofed glass. There's no way\nthis neighbor could have heard\nPodacter scream on the way down\nwith this door shut. The scream\nhe heard came from inside this\napartment, before Podacter was\nthrown over the railing! And the\nmuderer closed the door before he\nleft!\n(celebrates insanely)\n Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the\ndemons!\n(a la Poltergeist)\n This house is clear.\nINT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER\nAce drives straight ahead.\nMELISSA\n What are you thinking?\nACE\n I'm thinking this whole thing is\nconnected somehow.\n(frustrated)\n I'm thinking I want to find that\nother ring!\nMELISSA\n You checked all the rings.\nACE\n I know, Pessimistress. Could\nanyone else have gotten a ring\nthat year?\nMELISSA\n No. Camp was the only honoree.\nJust players and coaches.\nEveryone in the photo.\nACE\n \u0085Receipts! There must be\nreceipts! You have a key to the\noffice.\nMELISSA\n Ace this has been a really tough\nday. Can't we do this in the\nmorning?\nAce looks at his watch.\nACE\n Absolutely.\nEXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM\nAce's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa.\nINT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nIt's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls.\nMELISSA (O.S.)\n These files go back to seventy-\neight.\nINT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nAce is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him.\nMELISSA\n That was pretty impressive, what\nyou did back at the apartment.\nACE\n(still looking)\n You don't have to tell me. I was\nthere.\nMELISSA\n Maybe you should have joined the\npolice force\u0085 become a real\ndetective.\nACE\n(shaking his head)\n I don't do humans.\nMelissa gets a bit closer.\nMELISSA\n You really love animals, don't\nyou?\nAce stops searching and looks into her eyes.\nACE\n I feel a kinship with them. I\nunderstand them. Wanna hear\nsomething kinda spooky?\nMELISSA\n Sure.\nShe gets closer still.\nACE\n One time, when I was about twelve,\nI had this dream that I was being\nfollowed by a dog with rabies. He\nhad these really bloodshot eyes\nand foam coming out of his\nmouth\u0085 and just before I got to\nmy front door\u0085 he jumped on me\nand sunk his teeth in. Then I\nwoke up, and felt the back of my\nneck\u0085 check this out.\nAce motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, \nbarking like a vicious dog.\nACE\n ARARAR!!!\nMelissa jumps out of her skin.\nMELISSA\n Ohhh!! You bastard!\nACE\n(snickering)\n I'm sorry. I couldn't stop\nmyself. Are these all the\nreceipts?\nMELISSA\n(mildly annoyed)\n I don't know.\nACE\n There's only a dozen of them here.\nAce turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his \nmess.\nMELISSA\n(pointedly)\n Gee\u0085 maybe they were misplaced\nbecause somebody didn't put the\nfiles back when he was\u0085\nACE\n Who the hell is that?\nMELISSA\n What\u0085\nAce crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a \nplayer.\nACE\n That! Who the hell is that?!\nHe quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two.\nMELISSA\n Oh, that's Ray Finkle\u0085 the\nkicker. Don't you know who Ray\nFinkle is?\nACE\n No! How come he's not in this\npicture?!\nMelissa checks Ace's photo.\nMELISSA\n This was the picture you were\nusing? This was taken earlier in\nthe year. Finkle wasn't added to\nthe roster till mid-season.\nShe starts to realize what Ace has already figured out.\nMELISSA (CONT'D)\n He's the guy that missed the final\nfield goal in the Super Bowl that\nyear. Cost the Dolphins the game.\nACE\n But he got a ring?\nMELISSA\n Definitely.\nINT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER\nAce and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen.

The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, \nbullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks \non the door.

Ten years ago\nour son escaped from Shady Acres\nPsychiatric Hospital in Tampa.\nThey're still buggin' us to pick\nup his stuff.\nMrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies.\nMRS. FINKLE\n(sweetly)\n It was all that Dan Marino's\nfault, everyone knows that. If he\nhad held the ball laces out, like\nyou're supposed to, Ray would\nnever have missed that kick. Dan\nMarino should die of Gonorrhea and\nrot in Hell. Would you like a\ncookie, son?\nAce takes a cookie. Holding it up.\nACE\n Hey, what do ya know. They're\nlittle footballs.\nMRS. FINKLE\n Laces OUT!\nCRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window.

RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS\nIt's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with \nnooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: \"Death to Marino!\", \nMarino must die!!!, etc.\nACE\n \u0085Oooh boy.\nMRS. FINKLE\n What a sports nut, huh?\nIn the center of the room is a movie projector.\nACE\n May I?\nMRS. FINKLE\n Oh yes. By all means.\nMrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector.\nThe film flickers over the \"Marino must die!!!\" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. \nMarino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide.

He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight.\nAce sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, \nand gouging, and ripping his flesh.\nNow we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm.

It's from a\nDolphin '82 AFC Championship ring.\nIt would have been a Super Bowl\nring, but Ray Finkle missed the\nbig kick. Blames the whole thing\non Marino. We're talking\nparanoid, delusional psychosis. I\nsaw the guy's room\u0085 Cozy, if\nyou're Hannibal Lector.\nEINHORN\n So how does Roger Podacter fit in?\nACE\n My guess is Finkle was snooping\naround. Podacter recognized him.\nEnd of story.

Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!!\nIt's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions.\nACE\n URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW!\nThe crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away \nfrom the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time.\nAce incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new \nleader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other.\nThe thugs get the living crap \"moshed\" out of them.\nWhen the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air.

SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY\nMelissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc.\nDOCTOR\n You're brother won't be the first\nprofessional football player we've\ntreated.\nMELISSA\n Is that right?\nDOCTOR\n Yes. We're very sensitive to the\nemotional stress athletes have to\nendure.\nAce runs across the b.g. screaming \"I'm open! I'm open!\"\nDOCTOR\n We'll have to do some preliminary\nevaluations, but I think your\nbrother will fit in nicely here.\nMELISSA\n That's a relief, Doctor.\nAce takes a \"snap\" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the \ndoctor stop to watch him.\nDOCTOR\n He seems to have some difficulty\nletting go of the game. Has he\nhad a long history of mental\nillness?\nMELISSA\n(truthfully)\n As long as I've known him.\nAce does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating.\nINT.

STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION\nCartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE.\nAce looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the \njackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded \nIsotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. \"Laces Out!\" is insanely scrawled on every page.\nAce finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads:\nSEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER\nACE\n(reading)\n A massive search ended today when\nrescue workers were unable to find\nthe body of Lois Einhorn\u0085\n(stunned)\n \u0085a camper reported lost since\nFriday\u0085\n(to himself)\n Lois Einhorn\u0085 holy shit balls.\nAce sits bewildered.\nINT.

You\ngotta' check her out.\n(to Crazy Guy mimicking)\n Do you mind?\nThe Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones.\nEMILIO\n Ace, I like my job.

Come and\nget me.\nACE\n Emilio, Einhorn is involved.\nYou're gonna' have to make a\ndecision here.\n(beat)\n Listen, I gotta get off the phone.\nI think I just solved the Lindberg\ncase.\nMelissa and the Doctor return.\nDOCTOR\n Well, look who's trying to use the\nphone.\nAce covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice.\nACE\n Brian Piccalo is dead.\nAce breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away.\nWe hear a thrash version of the theme to \"Brian's Song\" as they exit the hospital.\nINT.

It's a\nnote from Podacter to Einhorn,\nthanking her for a wonderful\nSaturday night. This is too\nweird, man?\nACE\n Wiggles, rewind.\nWiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, \nand holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval.\nACE\n What the hell does Lois Einhorn\nhave to do with Ray Finkle? Come\non, think!\nDISSOLVE TO:\nLater. Ace is posed like Rodin's \"The Thinker\".\nACE\n Finkle and Einhorn. In it\ntogether. How? Why?\nA small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace.\nDISSOLVE TO:\nLater still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The \nmonkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle.\nACE\n Alright! Here we go! Answer's\nright there!

Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the \nverge of tears.\nACE\n(whimpering)\n Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn and\nFinkle.\nHe turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow.\nACE\n(to sleeping monkey)\n Quitter.\nWiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him.\nACE\n What do you want? Huh?\nWiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice.\nACE (CONT'D)\n What? I got no food for you. You\ngotta have money to buy food. I\ngotta find the dolphin to get the\nmoney. I don't see any dolphins\naround here, do you? Face it,\nit's hopeless\u0085 your master is a\nLOSER.\nAce buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again.\nACE\n LOO\u0085 HOO\u0085\nSuddenly he is silenced by something amazing.\nWiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair \nover the head shot. The \"make-over\" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!!\nACE\n Oh, my god! That's it!\nHe jumps up, estatic.\nACE\n Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is\nEinhorn!\u0085 Einhorn is a man!!!\nAce's expression quickly turns sour.\nACE\n OH MY GOD!!!

Ace shudders once more and then follows \nher.\nEXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY\nThe road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the \nopposite direction. Out of town.

INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\nImmense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons.\nAce cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he \nhears a familiar voice.\nJOHN MADDEN (O.S.)\n I particularly like the match-ups\nof the defense.\nAce sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game \nshow. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with \ntheir shoulders, driving him back five feet each time.\nJOHN MADDEN (ON TV)\n \u0085But the real story of this game\nis the absence of Dan Marino. Him\nbeing kidnapped and all has got to\nbe a strain on this Miami team. I\nreally feel sorry for those guys! I\nmean, it's hard enough enduring\nthe pressure of the Super Bowl,\nwithout your star quarterback\ngettin' himself kidnapped. This\nis the whole ball of wax, folks!\nYou wanna' get kidnapped, you do\nit in the off season!\u0085\nMarino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake \"watches\" from a ground level \ncistern serving as an ad hoc tank.\nAce sneaks closer.\nINT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY\nThe crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem.\nVarious shots of fans all standing at attention.\nIn the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new.\nINT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY\nEinhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. \nThe thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention.\nThe song ends. The crowd cheers.\nIn a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now.\nEINHORN\n I just love Super Bowl Sunday,\ndon't you, Dan? A magical\nafternoon where dreams are made\u0085\nor crushed!\nDAN\n Look lady, if you want tickets,\nyou're going about it in the wrong\nway.\nEINHORN\n Do I look familiar to you, Dan?\nDoes it seem as if we've met\nsomeplace before?\nDAN\n I don't know\u0085 I get hit in the\nhead a lot!\nOn the TV the ref makes an announcement.\nREF\nIt's tails. The Eagles will\nreceive.\nDan really struggles now.\nEINHORN\n Oops. Looks like we're going to\nhave to kick, Dan.\nEinhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she \nboots a ball through a window of the warehouse.\nMarino doesn't know what to think.\nEINHORN\n I made some refreshments, Dan.\nWould you like some refreshments,\nDan? I'll be right back,\nDaaaan!!\nShe goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail.\nMARINO\n Look, I don't know how much psycho\nwoman is paying you guys, but I\ncan double it.\nVINNIE\n Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho woman\nkeeps us out of prison.\nVinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football.\nROC\nHey, Marino, check it out. I'm\nthrowin' passes to a Dolphin!\nHe chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically.\nSnowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are \nfurious.\nVINNIE\n Get some more fish!\nINT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS\nRoc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing.\nROC\nWhere the hell's the smelts?\nHe stands up straight and we all hear that familiar \"Pop\" of a sunflower seed being cracked open.\nRoc's eyes widen. He turns and sees\u0085\nAce coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks \nRoc in the head with a pail full of fish.\nACE\n(doing Brando)\n He sleeps with the fishes.\nINT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS\nVINNIE\n Hey Roc, what the hell was that?\nVinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound.\nINT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS\nVinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts \nlined up on the ground.\nHe follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting \nagainst the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads \nto his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping.\nVinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up.\nVINNIE\n Hey man! What happened? What's\ngoin on\u0085?\nWe see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a \nchain from the ceiling.\nACE\n Guess what, boys, it's nap time.\nAce gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of \ntheir heads clean off.\nTwo headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks.\nCLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED\nACE\n Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I\ndidn't mean to - Oh man!!!\nAce holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done.\nACE\n(looking to God)\n Lord, I swear! I just wanted to\nknock them out!\nAce abruptly stops to think.\nACE\n Is that murder? I don't know.\nThey were gonna kill me. But they\ndidn't\u0085 But they tried. That's\nself defense. That's it!! I have\nnothing to worry about!!\nCUT TO:\nAce nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook.\nINT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY\nAce checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to \nuntie him.\nMARINO\n(whispers)\n Who are you?\nACE\n(whispers)\n Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I've\nbeen sent in with a special play.\n(whispers)\n Quarterback sneak.\nWE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN.\nEINHORN (O.S.)\n Penalty. Too many men on the\nfield.\nAce turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank.\nEINHORN (CON'T)\n I warned you, Ventura.\nACE\n What happened to \"Ace\"?\nEINHORN\n Good question.\nShe pulls out a cellular phone and dials.\nACE\n Be careful with that phone,\nlieutenant. I wouldn't want you\nto get a tumor.\nEINHORN\n(into phone)\n Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn.\nGet some men over to the old\nironworks factory on Victoria\nRoad. I've got the kidnapper\ntrapped in the warehouse. It's\nAce Ventura. He's killed Marino\nand Snowflake.\nEinhorn smiles as she puts the phone away.\nEINHORN\n Vinnie! Roc! Get in here!\nAce gets a very guilty look.\nACE\n What? Who are they? You mean\nthere's other people here?\nEXT.

Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc\u0085 Melissa \nruns behind, trying to catch up.\nMELISSA\n Emilio, is he in trouble?\nEMILIO\n Don't worry, there's nothing Ace\ncan't handle!\nINT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY\nEinhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck.\nACE\n Don't kill meeee!!\nPleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'll\nnever tell anyone! I swear!\n(indicating Marino)\n He's the one you want!! Kill\nhim!!\nMARINO\n(indicating Ace)\n No\u0085 kill him!\nThe two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.\nEINHORN\n No, I'm gonna kill the dolphin\nfirst.\n(to Ace)\n I wouldn't want you to miss that.\nEinhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES!\nWe see the bullet miss Snowflake under water.\nSnowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS!\nACE\n Blue forty-two!!\nEinhorn turns to Ace.\nEINHORN\n SHUT UP!!\nACE\n BLUE FORTY-TWO!\nEinhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way.\nACE\n HUT! HUT!\nSuddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick \nwe saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.\nACE\n(smug)\n Yes. The highly trained dolphin.\nPerhaps the smartest mammal in the\nanimal kingdom. See how he knew\nexactly what I wanted him to do,\nas if our minds were somehow in\ncomplete synchronization. They\nhave been know to save men at sea\nyou know. They have their own\nlanguage.\n(to Snowflake)\n Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake!\nBring me the gun!\n(makes dolphin sounds)\n EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE!\nJust like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then \nhands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk.\nACE\n(under his breath)\n Stupid fish.\nON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.\nJOHN MADDEN\n He got all of his leg into that\none!\nThe field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.\nACE\n Good to see someone who doesn't\nbuckle under the pressure?\nMARINO\n Yeah, not like in 82 when we\nchoked\u0085\nEinhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head.\nEINHORN\n What would you know about\npressure?\nACE\n Well, I've kissed a man.\nJOHN MADDEN (ON TV)\n Of course, there's never been a\nmore crucial kick than the famous\nKick heard 'round the world\u0085\nThe famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch.\nJOHN MADDEN\n \u0085I mean, it's clear to me that\nit was a good hold. Finkle just\nbooted it.\nEINHORN\n The laces weren't out. THE LACES\nWEREN'T OUT!!\nEinhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to \nsmack the gun out of her hand.\nA HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the \nface and stomach.\nEinhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down.\nEinhorn goes for the loose gun.

They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor.\nMore punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT \nteam, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals.\nAGUADO\n(caught up)\n Get him, Lois!\nNow they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles \ntoward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had.\nEINHORN\n(screaming)\n Shoot him! Shoot him!\nWe all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers.\nA loud voice comes from off camera.\nEMILIO\n DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE!\nMelissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin.\nMELISSA\n Put down your guns or this cop\ngets it!\nThe SWAT team hesitates.\nMELISSA (CONT'D)\n I mean it!!\nMuch to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.\nEMILIO\n(whispers to Melissa)\n Ah\u0085 Melissa? That's a hair\ntrigger.\n(loud to cops)\n She's not joking!\nThe SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet.\nEINHORN\n He kidnapped Snowflake. He killed\nRoger Podacter, and he was about\nto kill Dan Marino and me!\nACE\n Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! But\nI find the reference section much\nmore enlightening.\n(doing his best Clarence Darrow)\n For instance, if you were to look\nup 'professional football's all\ntime bonehead plays', you might\nread about a Miami Dolphin kicker\nnamed Ray Finkle, who missed a\ntwenty-six yard field goal in the\nclosing seconds of Super Bowl\nSeventeen.\n(in one breath)\n What you wouldn't read about is\nhow Ray Finkle lost his mind, and\nwas committed to a mental\ninstitute, only to escape and join\nthe police force under the assumed\nidentity of a missing hker,\nseducing her way to the top, in a\ndiabolical plan to get even with\nDan Marino whom he blamed for the\nentire thing!!!\nAce gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused.\nAGUADO\n What the hell are you trying to\nsay?\nACE\n She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray\nFinkle! She's a man!\nEINHORN\n He's lying! Shoot him!\nAce walks over to her.\nACE\n Let's just see who's lying. Would\na real woman have to wear one of\nthese?\nAce dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is \nreal. Ace keeps tugging it.\nThe SWAT team ready themselves.\nACE (CONT'D)\n Boy, that's really on there! But\ntell me this: Would a real woman\nbe missing these?!\nAce rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.\nThe sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.\nACE\n Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery\ncan be done over the weekend! But\nI doubt if she could find the time\nduring her busy schedule to get\nrid of Mr. Knish!!\nAce rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect \nfigure of a woman.\nACE\n Oooh boy.\nAce looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan \nMarino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.\nMARINO\n Psst\u0085 Ace. Come here.\nACE\n(to everyone)\n Could you excuse me just a second.\nAce goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.\nEINHORN\n Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!\nMELISSA\n(to cops)\n Don't anybody make a move!\nMarino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the \ncrowd.\nACE\n Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed\ncolleague Mr. Marino, has just\nbrought some new evidence to my\nattention. Now, history has\ncertainly shown that even the most\nintuitive criminal minds can be\nwrong, from time to time. But, if\nI have been mistaken\u0085 if the\nlieutenant is indeed a woman\u0085\nthen my friends, she is suffering\nfrom the worst case of hemorrhoids\nI have ever seen!!!\nAce spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle \nhas learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)\nEveryone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.\nFINKLE\n(deepest voice possible)\n It was Marino's fault. The laces\nwere in.\n(breaking down now)\n They were IN!!!\nQuick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.\nThen CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his \nspout.\nAce confidently cracks a sunflower seed.\nACE\n Somebody read it its rights.\nSuddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.\nFINKLE\n DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!\nThinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After \na few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.\nFINKLE\n(gasping for air)\n Help I can't swim!!!\nFinkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.\nSnowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side \nof the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.\nAce reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We \nsee that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a \nperfect fit.\nACE\n LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR\nHERR!!!\nMelissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.\nEMILIO\n Melissa\u0085 you can give me back my\ngun now.\nMelissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.\nNow Aguado appears beside Ace.\nAGUADO\n I don't know how you did it,\nVentura\u0085 but that was damn good\npolice work. Alright guys, let's\nwrap this up!\nEXT.

We see a \nhelicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.\nANNOUNCER (O.S.)\n Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami\nDolphins are proud to welcome back\nto BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our\nbeloved mascot and star of the\nhalftime show\u0085\nANGLE ON\nThe helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.\nANNOUNCER (O.S.)\n Snowflake!!\nAs the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing \nspectacular flips, they kiss.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nAs Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the \nforeground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.\nJust as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and \nshoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.\nACE\n You idiot! Do you know what\nyou've done?!\nThe giant eagle head looks up at Ace.\nMASCOT\n Huh?\nAce grabs him.\nACE\n You just cost me ten thousand\nbucks, Polly!\nMASCOT\n Yeah Blow me.\nACE\n REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!\nPULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot \nof finger pointing.\nEmilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.\nThe ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.\nANNOUNCER\n The National Football League would\nnow like to offer a special thank\nyou to the man who rescued Dan\nMarino and our beloved\nSnowflake\u0085\nOn the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.\nANNOUNCER (CONT'D)\n A great humanitarian, and lover of\nall animals\u0085 Mr. Ace Ventura!\nAce is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.\nThe image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he \nlooks into camera with his fist raised.\nMUSIC UP: THRASH METAL\nROLL CREDITS\nTHE END\n(LOKI NOTE: My copy of this script has the bloody end of Vinnie and Roc physically crossed out \nby three black marker lines, presumably by the authors. Fortunately, they were crossed out \ndiagonally, so I could still type the scene out for all to enjoy.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jack Bernstein\u00a0\u00a0Tom Shadyac\u00a0\u00a0Jim Carrey\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:18:45.215467"}
