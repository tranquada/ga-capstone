ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY \n</b>\n\tIt is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of \n\tBoston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. \n\n\tSHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark \n\tyoung man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears \n\tthe flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs \n\tand a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.\n<b> \n</b><b>2 \tOMIT \n</b>\n<b>3 \tOMIT \n</b>\n<b>4 \tOMIT\n</b><b> \n</b><b>5 \tEXT. STREET - DAY \n</b>\n\tFOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. \n\tHis smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without \n\tstopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is \n\tnot dissuaded.\n<b> \n</b><b>6\tINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \n</b>\n\tShorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a \n\tsurgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on \n\ta table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, \n\tthe eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing \n\tbeing done just so, in time-honored fashion.\n\n\tHe slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.\n\tHe adds water and makes a paste of the starch.\n\n\tBehind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is\n \tgetting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)\n\tone of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, \n\tCHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tAfter I hit the number that woman wasn't no good \n\t\tto me at all.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe men laugh.\n<b> \n</b>\tANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and \n\tstrong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden \n\tspoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as \n\tfumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.\n<b> \n</b>\tANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly \n\tajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY'S VOICE \n</b>\t\tShe says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond \n\t\tring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap \n\t\tblack sunovabitch to boot.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n</b>\t\tAnd when a black woman call you a cheap black \n\t\tsunovabitch you've been called a cheap black \n\t\tsunovabitch.\n<b> \n</b>\tCholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tWill you let me tell it?\n\n\tON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, \n\tunfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of\n \trubber gloves.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tWhere's Homeboy?\n\n\tHe is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of \n\tVaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts \n\tof an exasperating child.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tRed's in the head, man.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n</b>\t\tYou mean hiding in the head.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tHey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. \n\n\tHis hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes \n\tout, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes \n\tand an expression of apprehension.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n</b>\t\tGonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, \n\t\tHomeboy?\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tMan, don't scare him more than he's scared \n\t\talready. Ain't too bad...\n<b> \n</b>\tMalcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes \n\thim with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding \n\ta protective collar of paper.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY\n</b>\t...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her \n\tcherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But \n\tpretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, \n\tHomeboy?\n<b> \n</b><b>\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n</b>\n\tMalcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. \n\n\tShorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's \n\tscalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered\n \taround, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a \n\tkind of execution.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tGit his forehead and eyebrows.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tI know what I'm doing.\n<b> \n</b>\tShorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the\n\tsteaming jar and places it nearby.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHORTY (contd)\n \t\tListen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging \n\t\twhen I get through 'cause this shit can burn a \n\t\thole through cement.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n</b>\t\tHold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.\n<b> \n</b>\tMalcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty \n\tapplies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n</b>\t\tI thought you said it was gonna sting... this \n\t\tain't nothin'.\n<b> \n</b>\tFor a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries \n\tto catch his breath: his head is on fire.\n<b> \n</b>                    MALCOLM (contd)\n\t\tYou motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm \n\t\tburning up. My damn head is on fire.\n\n\tHe nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.\n\n\tShorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the \n\tcongolene into his hair. \n\n\tMalcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a \n\tbasin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the \n\troom, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his \n\thair.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tDon't fight me, man. Let me git it out.\n<b> \n</b>\tMalcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he \n\tfeels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces \n\this head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting \n\tMalcolm and the shop in the process.\n<b> \n</b><b>7\tOMIT \n</b>\n<b>8 \tOMIT\n</b><b> \n</b><b>9  \tINT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY\n</b><b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tWell, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.\n<b> \n</b>\tShorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into \n\tthe jacket...\n<b> \n</b>\tShoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......\n \tdons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully \n\toutfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length \n\tmirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.\n<b> \n</b><b>     \t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tWell, all right, then.\n<b> \n</b><b>   \t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tWell, all reet, then.\n<b> \n</b>\tThe transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands. \n\n<b>10\tEXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY\n</b><b> \n</b>\tMalcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,\n\tzoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the \n\tstreet notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the \n\tlighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully \n\taware of their impact.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM\n</b><b> \n</b>\tFREEZE FRAME.

ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT\n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tCLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY\n</b><b> \n</b>\tThey both were posed for a picture. The music \"FLYING HOME\" is blaring \n\tas LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the\n \tdancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately \n\tBLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.\n \tAnd Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed \n\tcouples on the floor. \n\n\tA BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond\n\thair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tA VOICE \n</b><b>\t\tSHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!\n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT \n</b>\n\tPeople start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers.

People start clapping to the beat as they form a U \n\taround the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.\n<b> \n</b><b>16 \tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR\n</b><b> \n</b>\tTWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined \n\tby a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the \n\tmain event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to \n\tget better vantage points and the competition is under way.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE ON THE CROWD \n</b>\n\tIt is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, \n\tmostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of\n \trefinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch \n\ther eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one \n\tin particular, but nonetheless looking.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR\n</b><b> \n</b>\tGetting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and \n\tbounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is \n\tgreeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. \n\n<b>\tWIDER SHOT\n</b>\n\tThe music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more \n\tremarkable quality. \n\n<b>\tFOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM \n</b>\n\tHe is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. \n\tHe makes his way through the watching audience. \n\n<b>\tCLOSE - LAURA \n</b>\n\tShe is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm \n\tapproaching.\n\n\tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one \n\tanother, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tCome on, baby, let's show 'em how.\n<b> \n</b>\tLaura smiles shyly; she's willing.\n<b> \n</b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tYou better get out of them shoes, girl.\n<b> \n</b>\tLaura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of \n\tsneakers.\n<b> \n</b><b>17 \tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR\n</b><b> \n</b>\tBecause of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a \n\tmoment they are executing the most intricate steps of the \"flapping \n\teagle\" and the \"kangaroo.\" Malcolm starts boosting her over and around \n\this hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect \n\tpartner. She loves it.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE WITH THE CROWD\n</b><b> \n</b>\tSo does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: \"Go,\n \tman, go.\" \"Hey, Red.\" \"Mmmmmm ummm.\"\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE: - SHORTY\n</b><b> \n</b>\tA big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and \n\tshe takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around \n\tlike a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has \n\thad enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.\n<b> \n</b>\tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners \n\tnow; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp \n\twaves over.\n<b> \n</b>\tMalcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that \n\tpeople are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in \n\tparticular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to \n\this steps.\n<b> \n</b>\tSeeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of \n\tthe floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and \n\tMalcolm go into a solo.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLES\n</b><b> \n</b>\tThe crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. \n\tThe finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around \n\tMalcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous \n\tapplause of the audience. \n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) \n</b>\n\tClapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. \n\n<b>\tCLOSE SHOT - SHORTY\n</b><b> \n</b>\tWaiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking \n\this hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tHey, man, gimme some skin.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tShorty, this is Laura.\n<b> \n</b>Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tLAURA\n</b>\t\t'Lo. I've got to freshen up.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tNow you come back.\n<b>  \n</b>\tLaura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tThat's a fine chick.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tFine as May wine.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n</b>\t\tExcept she live on the hill and got a grandma.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tMake it too easy and it ain't no fun.\n<b> \n</b>\tThen his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a \n\tsimple, direct gesture, \"Want to dance?\" Malcolm eyes Shorty and \n\twordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.\n<b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR\n</b><b> \n</b>\tImmediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the \n\tcynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because \n\tshe is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not \n\tan obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine \n\tsteps.\n<b> \n</b>\tTWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock \n\this black world. \n\n<b>\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n</b>\n\tTrying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the \n\tdancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for\n \tit.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSOPHIA \n</b>\t\tWhy don't you take your little girl home, Red, \n\t\tand come on back?\n<b> \n</b>\tHe stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.\n<b> \n</b>\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tJust walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you \n\t\tget back. \n\n\tHe can only grin.\n\n<b>18\tEXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT \n</b>\n\tThe porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get \n\taway.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tI better not come in.\n<b>  \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tLAURA\n</b>\t\tI ain't stupid.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tI mean it's late, baby.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tLAURA\n</b>\t\tI know where you're going.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n</b>\t\tI'm going to bed.

SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT\n</b><b> \n</b>\tThe lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' \"IF I\n<b> \tDIDN'T CARE.\"\n</b><b> \n</b><b>\tANGLE - SOPHIA\n</b><b> \n</b>\tSophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe \n\twhite breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's \n\tvery unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might \n\tsay Sophia was way ahead of her time.\n<b> \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tSOPHIA\n</b>\t\tMalcolm, look at them.
