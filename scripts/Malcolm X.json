ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY \n\n\tIt is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of \n\tBoston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. \n\n\tSHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark \n\tyoung man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears \n\tthe flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs \n\tand a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.\n \n2 \tOMIT \n\n3 \tOMIT \n\n4 \tOMIT\n \n5 \tEXT. STREET - DAY \n\n\tFOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. \n\tHis smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without \n\tstopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is \n\tnot dissuaded.\n \n6\tINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \n\n\tShorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a \n\tsurgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on \n\ta table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, \n\tthe eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing \n\tbeing done just so, in time-honored fashion.\n\n\tHe slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.\n\tHe adds water and makes a paste of the starch.\n\n\tBehind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is\n \tgetting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)\n\tone of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, \n\tCHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tAfter I hit the number that woman wasn't no good \n\t\tto me at all.\n \n\tThe men laugh.\n \n\tANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and \n\tstrong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden \n\tspoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as \n\tfumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.\n \n\tANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly \n\tajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY'S VOICE \n\t\tShe says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond \n\t\tring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap \n\t\tblack sunovabitch to boot.\n\n\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n\t\tAnd when a black woman call you a cheap black \n\t\tsunovabitch you've been called a cheap black \n\t\tsunovabitch.\n \n\tCholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tWill you let me tell it?\n\n\tON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, \n\tunfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of\n \trubber gloves.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tWhere's Homeboy?\n\n\tHe is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of \n\tVaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts \n\tof an exasperating child.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tRed's in the head, man.\n \n\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n\t\tYou mean hiding in the head.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tHey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. \n\n\tHis hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes \n\tout, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes \n\tand an expression of apprehension.\n \n\t\t\t\tTOOMER \n\t\tGonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, \n\t\tHomeboy?\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tMan, don't scare him more than he's scared \n\t\talready. Ain't too bad...\n \n\tMalcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes \n\thim with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding \n\ta protective collar of paper.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY\n\t...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her \n\tcherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But \n\tpretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, \n\tHomeboy?\n \n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n\n\tMalcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. \n\n\tShorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's \n\tscalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered\n \taround, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a \n\tkind of execution.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tGit his forehead and eyebrows.\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tI know what I'm doing.\n \n\tShorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the\n\tsteaming jar and places it nearby.\n\n\t\t\t\tSHORTY (contd)\n \t\tListen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging \n\t\twhen I get through 'cause this shit can burn a \n\t\thole through cement.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHOLLY \n\t\tHold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.\n \n\tMalcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty \n\tapplies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.\n\n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n\n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM\n\t\tI thought you said it was gonna sting... this \n\t\tain't nothin'.\n \n\tFor a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries \n\tto catch his breath: his head is on fire.\n \n                    MALCOLM (contd)\n\t\tYou motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm \n\t\tburning up. My damn head is on fire.\n\n\tHe nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.\n\n\tShorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the \n\tcongolene into his hair. \n\n\tMalcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a \n\tbasin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the \n\troom, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his \n\thair.\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tDon't fight me, man. Let me git it out.\n \n\tMalcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he \n\tfeels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces \n\this head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting \n\tMalcolm and the shop in the process.\n \n7\tOMIT \n\n8 \tOMIT\n \n9  \tINT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tWell, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.\n \n\tShorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into \n\tthe jacket...\n \n\tShoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......\n \tdons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully \n\toutfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length \n\tmirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.\n \n     \t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tWell, all right, then.\n \n   \t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWell, all reet, then.\n \n\tThe transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands. \n\n10\tEXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY\n \n\tMalcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,\n\tzoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the \n\tstreet notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the \n\tlighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully \n\taware of their impact.\n \n\tCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM\n \n\tFREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.\n \n\t\t\t\tVOICE OF MALCOLM X \n\t\tWhen my mother was pregnant with me, she told \n\t\tme later, a party of Klansmen on horseback \n\t\tsurrounded our house in Omaha.\n\n10A \tANGLE.

ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT\n \n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY\n \n\tThey both were posed for a picture. The music \"FLYING HOME\" is blaring \n\tas LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the\n \tdancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately \n\tBLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.\n \tAnd Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed \n\tcouples on the floor. \n\n\tA BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond\n\thair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.\n \n\t\t\t\tA VOICE \n\t\tSHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!\n \n\tANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT \n\n\tPeople start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The \n\tmusic begins to get faster and more furious. \n\n\tCLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT \n\n\tIt is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U \n\taround the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.\n \n16 \tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR\n \n\tTWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined \n\tby a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the \n\tmain event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to \n\tget better vantage points and the competition is under way.\n \n\tANGLE ON THE CROWD \n\n\tIt is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, \n\tmostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of\n \trefinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch \n\ther eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one \n\tin particular, but nonetheless looking.\n \n\tANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR\n \n\tGetting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and \n\tbounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is \n\tgreeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. \n\n\tWIDER SHOT\n\n\tThe music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more \n\tremarkable quality. \n\n\tFOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM \n\n\tHe is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. \n\tHe makes his way through the watching audience. \n\n\tCLOSE - LAURA \n\n\tShe is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm \n\tapproaching.\n\n\tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one \n\tanother, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tCome on, baby, let's show 'em how.\n \n\tLaura smiles shyly; she's willing.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tYou better get out of them shoes, girl.\n \n\tLaura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of \n\tsneakers.\n \n17 \tINT. THE DANCE FLOOR\n \n\tBecause of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a \n\tmoment they are executing the most intricate steps of the \"flapping \n\teagle\" and the \"kangaroo.\" Malcolm starts boosting her over and around \n\this hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect \n\tpartner. She loves it.\n \n\tANGLE WITH THE CROWD\n \n\tSo does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: \"Go,\n \tman, go.\" \"Hey, Red.\" \"Mmmmmm ummm.\"\n \n\tANGLE: - SHORTY\n \n\tA big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and \n\tshe takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around \n\tlike a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has \n\thad enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.\n \n\tTWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners \n\tnow; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp \n\twaves over.\n \n\tMalcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that \n\tpeople are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in \n\tparticular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to \n\this steps.\n \n\tSeeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of \n\tthe floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and \n\tMalcolm go into a solo.\n \n\tANGLES\n \n\tThe crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. \n\tThe finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around \n\tMalcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous \n\tapplause of the audience. \n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) \n\n\tClapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. \n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - SHORTY\n \n\tWaiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking \n\this hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tHey, man, gimme some skin.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tShorty, this is Laura.\n \nLaura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.\n \n\t\t\t\tLAURA\n\t\t'Lo. I've got to freshen up.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tNow you come back.\n  \n\tLaura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tThat's a fine chick.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tFine as May wine.\n \n\t\t\t\tSHORTY \n\t\tExcept she live on the hill and got a grandma.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMake it too easy and it ain't no fun.\n \n\tThen his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a \n\tsimple, direct gesture, \"Want to dance?\" Malcolm eyes Shorty and \n\twordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.\n \n\tANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR\n \n\tImmediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the \n\tcynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because \n\tshe is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not \n\tan obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine \n\tsteps.\n \n\tTWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock \n\this black world. \n\n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM \n\n\tTrying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the \n\tdancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for\n \tit.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA \n\t\tWhy don't you take your little girl home, Red, \n\t\tand come on back?\n \n\tHe stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tJust walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you \n\t\tget back. \n\n\tHe can only grin.\n\n18\tEXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT \n\n\tThe porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get \n\taway.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI better not come in.\n  \n\t\t\t\tLAURA\n\t\tI ain't stupid.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI mean it's late, baby.\n \n\t\t\t\tLAURA\n\t\tI know where you're going.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need \n\t\tmy rest.\n \n\tLaura walks to the door.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tBaby, I'll call you tomorrow.\n \n\t\t\t\tLAURA\n\t\tWhat for? I ain't white and I don't put out. \n\n\tThe front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\t'Night, Mrs. Johnson.\n \n\tHe runs down the porch steps.\n \n19\tINT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT\n \n\tThe lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' \"IF I\n \tDIDN'T CARE.\"\n \n\tANGLE - SOPHIA\n \n\tSophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe \n\twhite breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's \n\tvery unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might \n\tsay Sophia was way ahead of her time.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tMalcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white \n\t\tbreasts like these?\n \n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM\n \n\tHe shakes his head.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tPut your black hands on them.\n \n\tHe is paralyzed.\n\n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tPlease do as I say.\n \n\tMalcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life \n\tdepended on it and he commences to kill it.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tHey, baby.\n \n \tShe stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA (contd) \n\t\tAm I the first white woman you've been with? \n\n\tShe already knows the answer. He laughs.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tSheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\t...That isn't a whore?\n\n\tKnowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. \n\n\tA beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his \n\thand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA\n\t\tThat's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's \n\t\tnot going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't \n\t\trun.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tShhhh! I don't like women that talk.\n \n\tCLOSE - SOPHIA\n\n\tShe shrugs, then moves to embrace him.\n \n\t\t\t\tSOPHIA \n\t\tWho wants to talk? \n\n\tThe couple starts at it again. \n\n19A\tINT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY\n \n\tOn the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat-\n\tfooted coppers with machine guns.

The line of PRISONERS \n\tstands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one \n\twhite, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. \n\n\tThe procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three \n\ttimes a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the \n\tprisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell.

SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards \n\tare approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced \n\tPRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper \n\tsurreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their \n\tlips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --\n\tbeaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is \n\tBEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately \n\tthe gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him \n\twith great respect.\n \n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tLooka Satan.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI see him.\n \n\tBembry's language is very unhip.

Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, \n\tgrabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest \n\tof his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number.

SHOWER ROOM - DAY\n \n\tMalcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his \n\tbroken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his \n\tproblems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings \n\tfor a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.\n \n\tHe turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's \n\tBembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in \n\tthe water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left \n\talone.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI know how you feel. Like you want to lay down \n\t\tand die.\n \n\tMalcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY (contd) \n\t\tI brought you something.\n \n\tHe puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. \n\tMalcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to \n\tdeep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWho the hell are you?\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tPut it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMan, what do you want?\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tYou need something.

And drinks it down quickly.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tSit down or it might knock you down.\n \n\tMalcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he \n\tsmiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry \n\twonderingly, unable to figure him out.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tIf you ain't trying to punk me, what's your \n\t\thype?\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI can show you how to get out of prison.

'Cause you couldn't hear \n\t\tme without it.\n \n\tThis is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He \n\teyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWhat in the hell are you talking about?\n \n\tHe begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is \n\tsaying.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI think you got more sense than any cat in this \n\t\tprison. How come you are such a fool?\n \n\tMalcolm looks over, piqued.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY (contd) \n\t\tNobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the\n\t\t movies. Because even if you get out, you are \n\t\tstill in prison.\n \n\tMalcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYou ain't lying.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tWhen you go busting your fists against a stone \n\t\twall, you're not using your brains. Cause \n\t\tthat's what the white man wants you to do. Look \n\t\tat you.\n \n\tThese last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his \n\thands massaging the conk into his hair.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY (contd) \n\t\tPutting all that poison in your hair.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMan, you been locked up too long, everybody \n\t\tconks.

I got to wash it out.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tLet it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.\n \n\tBut it is burning now.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMan, you better get off me.\n \n\tHe wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tSure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all \n\t\tthat poison into your hair, into your body -- \n\t\ttrying to be white.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMan, I don't want to hear all that.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI thought you was smart. But you just another \n\t\tone of them cats strutting down the avenue in \n\t\tyour clown suit with all that mess on you. Like \n\t\ta monkey. And the white man sees you and he \n\t\tlaughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't \n\t\twhite.\n \n\tMalcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk.

He is pulling the comb through his hair.\n \n110 \tINT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY\n \n\tPRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes \n\tlicense plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks \n\tto the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little \n\tremoved from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, \n\tidles by a window.\n \n\tA whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out \n\tinto the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.\n \n\t\t\t\tGUARD BARNES \n\t\tYou taking the yard?\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI'm staying.\n \n\tBarnes gestures to Malcolm.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMe too.\n\n\tHe goes.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tWhat you sniffing around for?

He taught you to \n\t\tworship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin\n\t\t-- and you believed him. He told you black was \n\t\ta curse, you believed him.

He is a remarkable man who always takes \n\tcareful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; \n\the talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk\n \tfunky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the \n\tBible. Right now he goes into street talk.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tI'll pull your coat, daddy.

MALCOLM'S CELL - NIGHT \n\n\tHe is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go \n\tout. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his \n\tposition to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light \n\tcoming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. \n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK \n\n\tMalcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the \"a's\": the words\n\tazimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his \n\thand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its \n\tmeaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word \n\tfor word.\n \n114 \tINT. LIBRARY - DAY\n \n\tThere are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their \n\ttitles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G.

Malcolm reaches into his jacket \n\tagain, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My \n\tStruggle_. He sits next to the license press to read.\n \n116\tEXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY \n\n\tA baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. \n\tMost of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every \n\tpitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. \n\n\tANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY \n\n\tThey are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene.\n\n\tANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big \n\tcheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around \n\tthe bases.\n  \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tOle Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay \n\t\tin there with the wood.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tLemme tell you about history: black history. \n\t\tYou listening?\n \n\tTWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYou pitch, baby; I'll ketch.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY \n\t\tThe first men on earth were black.

They let us sing and dance and \n\t\tsmile -- and now they let one black man in the \n\t\tmajors. That don't cancel out the greatest \n\t\tcrime in history. When that blue-eyed devil \n\t\tlocked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- \n\t\tbroke up our families, tortured us, cut us off \n\t\tfrom our language, our religion, our history.\n\n\tSHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS\n \n\tIn the stands, cheering and joyous.\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY (contd) \n\t\tDo they know who they are?

It is suddenly suffused with light. And \n\tstanding in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has \n\tmaterialized, but he can be seen through.

Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. It's \n\tthe only hand up. The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but \n\tthere aren't any.\n \n\tPete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers.\n \n\t\t\t\tPETE\n\t\tWatch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.\n \n \n\t\t\t\tCHAPLAIN GILL \n\t\tI see this has become a struggle between good \n\t\tand evil. Satan has a question.\n \n\tThere is laughter from the convicts.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want \n\t\tto say which one of us is what.\n \n\tLaughter, especially from the black convicts.\n \n\t\t\t\tCHAPLAIN GILL \n\t\tWhy don't you just ask your question?\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYou've been talking about the disciples. What \n\t\tcolor were they?\n \n\t\t\t\tCHAPLAIN GILL \n\t\tI don't think we know for certain.\n \n\tThere are reactions from the convicts. Malcolm is sharply challenging a \n\twhite man about color.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tThey were Hebrew, weren't they?\n \n\t\t\t\tCHAPLAIN GILL \n\t\tThat's right.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tAs Jesus was.

BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M.\n \n\tIn contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of \n\tactivity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; \n\tLorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; \n\tBembry is recruiting on the telephone.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tHow many you turning out?\n \n\t\t\t\tSIDNEY \n\t\t500.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tMake it 1000.

You say that white \n\t\tman loves you and yet he has done every evil \n\t\tact against you. He has everything while he is \n\t\tliving and tells you to be a good slave and \n\t\twhen you die you will have more than he has in \n\t\tBeulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in \n\t\tpitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to \n\t\ta picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed \n\t\tJesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on \n\t\tearth.

WE SEE the \n\tstreet corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS \n\tharanguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just \n\tone among many:\n\n\t\t\t\tSECOND SPEAKER\n\t\tIf the man behind the counter ain't black, \n\t\tdon't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think \n\t\tblack.

It is \n\tbetter furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, \n\tand Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. \n\tMalcolm stands at a podium.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWe're not American, we're Africans who happen \n\t\tto be in America. We were kidnapped and brought \n\t\there against our will from Africa.

Malcolm comes down \n\tfrom the platform and walks to him.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tFolks, the brother is shy and needs special \n\t\tattention. So would you excuse us, while Brothers \n\t\tSidney and Earl take up the collection.\n\n\tHe embraces Shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and Brothers \n\tSidney and Earl have a chuckle themselves.\n \n133\tINT.

Oh, my he has no conscience. He \n\t\tshould fall on his knees and say, \"My kind \n\t\tcommits history's greatest crime against your \n\t\tkind every day of your life.\" But does he? No. \n\t\tHe scorns you, splits your head with his \n\t\tnightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had \n\t\tit, then stand up and come forward. If not us, \n\t\tthen who?

And \n\t\tthe Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting \n\t\tthe black people economically, civilly, and \n\t\totherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the \n\t\tHonorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic \n\t\tsimply because he teaches our people to go into \n\t\tbusiness for ourselves and trying to take over \n\t\tthe economic leadership in our own community. \n\t\tThe black people in this country have been the \n\t\tvictims of violence at the hands of the white \n\t\tman for 400 years, and following the ignorant \n\t\tNegro preachers, we have thought that it was \n\t\tGod-like to turn the other cheek to the brute \n\t\tthat was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they \n\t\tuse to put on a white sheet and use a \n\t\tbloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken\n\t\toff sheets and put on police uniforms, they've \n\t\ttraded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And \n\t\tjust as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to \n\t\tkeep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds \n\t\tor resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them \n\t\tto love their enemy or pray for those who use \n\t\tthem as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah \n\t\tMuhammad is showing black people that just as \n\t\tthe white man and every other person on this \n\t\tearth has God given rights, natural rights, \n\t\tcivil rights, and any other kind of rights that \n\t\tyou can think of when it comes to defending \n\t\thimself.\n \n159\n\nA-C\tINT. TV STUDIO \n\n\tCLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE \n\n\tWith a studio mike around his neck, he's on a panel show. \n\n\tANGLE - MODERATOR\n \n\t\t\t\tMODERATOR\n\t\tMr. X, before we start our discussion tonight \n\t\t-- The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers -- would you \n\t\tmind explaining for us the meaning of your \n\t\tname, which is the letter X.\n \n\tANGLE - PANEL \n\n\tOpposing Malcolm is DR. PAYSON, a NAACP-type NEGRO. \n\n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the \n\t\tslavemasters named most of the so-called \n\t\tNegroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah \n\t\tMuhammad teaches us once you come into the \n\t\tknowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name \n\t\twith an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut \n\t\toff from our Eastern culture for so long that \n\t\twe don't know the names we originally had, we \n\t\twill use X until we get back to the East.\n \n\tANGLE - MODERATOR\n \n\t\t\t\tMODERATOR\n\t\tThank you. Now Dr. Payson.\n \n\tCLOSE - DR. PAYSON\n \n\t\t\t\tDR. PAYSON \n\t\tMr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so \n\t\the exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good \n\t\tlaw-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you \n\t\ta question?\n  \n\tCLOSE: - DR. PAYSON\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tPlease, go ahead.\n \n\t\t\t\tDR. PAYSON \n\t\tMr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black \n\t\tsupremacy? Why do you teach hate?\n \n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tFor the white man to ask the black man if he \n\t\thates him is just like the rapist asking the \n\t\traped, or the wolf asking the sheep, \"Do you \n\t\thate me!\" The white man is in no moral position \n\t\tto accuse anyone of hate.\n \n\tANGLE - PANEL\n \n\t\t\t\tMODERATOR\n\t\tCertainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been \n\t\tprogress.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI'll talk about \"progress\" in a minute, but let \n\t\tme finish with my brother.\n\n\tMalcolm gestures to the Negro panelist.  The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV \n\taudience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio \n\taudience.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tStop me if I'm wrong. I \"polarize the community.\" \n\t\tI \"erroneously appraise the racial picture.\"\n \n\t\t\t\tDR. PAYSON \n\t\tYou put it very well.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tYou left one phrase out. Another educated \n\t\tKneegrew said to me and I quote: \"Brother \n\t\tMalcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices \n\t\tof the Negro subculture.\" Would you agree?\n \n\t\t\t\tDR. PAYSON \n\t\tEntirely.\n \n\tANGLE - MALCOLM\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWell, I have this to say. Do you know what a \n\t\tNegro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is \n\t\tcalled -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's \n\t\tcalled a nigger.\n \n\tThere is some blanching and guffawing from the audience. The moderator \n\tis totally embarrassed, Betty roars.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tAnd I'm not finished. To understand this man--\n \n\tHe points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\t--you must know that historically there are two \n\t\tkinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field \n\t\tNegroes. The house Negro lived in the big \n\t\thouse; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty \n\t\tgood and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved \n\t\thim more than the master loved himself. If the \n\t\tmaster's house caught fire, he'd be the first \n\t\tto put the blaze out. If the master got sick, \n\t\the'd say: \"What's a matter, boss; we sick?\" \n\t\tWE sick! If someone said to him, \"Let's run \n\t\taway and escape. Let's separate.\" He'd say, \n\t\t\"Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I \n\t\tgot here?\" That was the House Negro. In those \n\t\tdays he was called the House Nigger. Well, \n\t\tthat's what we call them today because we still \n\t\tgot a lot of House Niggers running around.\n \n\tThere is applause from the blacks in the audience. Moderator tries to \n\tregain control.\n \n159D\tINT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY\n \n\tCLOSE - THE HONORABLE ELIJAH MUHAMMAD \n\n\tHe is enjoying this display by his prize student, the CAMERA PANS to a \n\tCLOSE SHOT of BEMBRY and the same cannot be said.\n \n159E \tBACK TO STUDIO\n \n\t\t\t\tMODERATOR\n\t\tI think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to--\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tDon't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?\n \n\t\t\t\tDR. PAYSON \n\t\tLet him finish.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tThank you. Now the Negro in the field caught \n\t\thell all day long. He was beaten by the master; \n\t\the lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and \n\t\thated his master. If the house caught fire, \n\t\the'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, \n\t\the'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to \n\t\thim, \"Let's go, let's separate\", he'd yell, \n\t\t\"Yeah, man, any place is better than this.\" \n\t\tYou've got a lot of Field Negroes in America \n\t\ttoday. I'm one.\n \n\t\t\t\tBROTHER BENJAMIN \n\t\tTell it.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\t--there's another one. The majority of black \n\t\tAmericans today are Field Negroes. They don't \n\t\ttalk about OUR progress, about OUR government, \n\t\tOUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't \n\t\teven let you near the plant.\n \n159F\tINT.

The \n\t\tbrothers think he thinks _he_ is the Nation of \n\t\tIslam, that he has aspirations to lead the \n\t\tNation. It was you who made Malcolm the man he\n\t\tis. You lifted him out of the darkness.\n \n\tCLOSE - ELIJAH\n \n\t\t\t\tELIJAH \n\t\tGo and tell the brothers what Brother Minister \n\t\tis doing, has done, has been of great benefit \n\t\tto the Nation.\n \n\tCLOSER - BEMBRY\n \n\t\t\t\tBEMBRY\n\t\tGreat benefit for himself. \n\n159G\tBRIEF MONTAGE. THE RISE OF MALCOLM X\n \n\tEXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY \n\n\tMalcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for \n\toffice. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD \n\tfollows him. Malcolm sees a WINO.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tBrother Man, put that bottle down, take that \n\t\tpoison away from your lips. That's what the \n\t\tdevil wants you to do, stay high, out of your \n\t\tnatural mind. I know, I've been there.\n \n\tThe wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine.\n \n159H\t--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS \n\tarmed with microphones. He walks; they follow.\n \n159I\t--Malcolm walking in Harlem, urging people to lift themselves up, come \n\tto the meetings, etc.\n \n159J \tINT. TEMPLE #7\n \n\tMalcolm sits with Benjamin.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tIt's time you received your X.

When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop \n\t\tbeing addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and\n\t\tcommitting adultery. When we get off the \n\t\twelfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need \n\t\tfor your family, then your family respects you. \n\t\tThey'll be proud to say \"That's my father.\" \n\t\tShe's proud to say \"That's my husband...\" \n\t\tFather means you're taking care of those \n\t\tchildren. Just 'cause you made them that don't \n\t\tmean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, \n\t\tbut anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can \n\t\tgo and get a woman but anybody can't take care \n\t\tof a woman. This is the type of teaching that \n\t\tthe honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we \n\t\tcan build the moral fiber of our people.\n \n\tSHOT OF REPORTERS IN AUDIENCE\n \n\tBeginning to scribble furiously.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI can see the gentlemen of the press, also the \n\t\tFBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz \n\t\tif I said, \"Mary had a little lamb,\" they'd \n\t\twrite Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.\n \n\tLoud laughter from the audience. But this response is overwhelmed by \n\tthe response of ANOTHER, LARGER AUDIENCE.\n \n162\tINT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT \n\n\tMalcolm is talking before an all-black audience. It is the largest \n\trally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tWe have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in \n\t\tAtlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 \n\t\ttemples in fifty states. From a handful we \n\t\thave grown to scores of thousands.\n \n\tVARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RALLY \n\n\tHAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the \n\tpodium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry. For the first \n\ttime a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on \n\tresentment. When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool. \n\tSidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM/HIS VOICE \n\t\tThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that \n\t\tGod is now about to establish a kingdom on this \n\t\tearth based on brotherhood and \n\n\t\t[...]\n\n\t\tagainst peace, his history on this earth has \n\t\tproved that. Nowhere in history has he been \n\t\tbrotherly toward anyone. The only time he has \n\t\tbeen brotherly toward you is when he can use \n\t\tyou, when he can exploit you, when he can \n\t\toppress you, when you will submit to him. And \n\t\tsince his own history makes him unqualified to \n\t\tbe an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of \n\t\tbrotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad \n\t\tteaches us that God is about to eliminate that \n\t\tparticular race from this earth. So since they \n\t\tare due for elimination, we don't want to be \n\t\twith them.\n \n\tANGLE - CROWD\n \n\tCLOSE - MALCOLM\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tIf the so-called Negro were American citizens \n\t\twe wouldn't have a race problem. If the \n\t\tEmancipation Proclamation was authentic, you \n\t\twouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, \n\t\t14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution \n\t\twas authentic, you wouldn't have a race \n\t\tproblem. If the Supreme Court desegregation \n\t\tdecision was authentic, you wouldn't have a \n\t\trace problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These \n\t\tNegro leaders have been telling the white man \n\t\teverything is all right, everything is under \n\t\tcontrol. And they've been telling the white man \n\t\tthat Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to \n\t\thim. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been \n\t\tsaying is going to come to pass is now coming \n\t\tto pass and now the Negro leaders are standing \n\t\tup saying that we are about to have a racial \n\t\texplosion. We're going to have a racial \n\t\texplosion and that's more dangerous than an \n\t\tatomic explosion.\n \n\tANGLE - MALCOLM\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tIt's going to explode because black people are \n\t\tdissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only \n\t\twith the white man, but with these Negroes who \n\t\thave been sitting around here posing as leaders \n\t\tand spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put \n\t\ttoo many sparks around a powder keg, the thing \n\t\tis going to explode and if the thing that \n\t\texplodes is still inside the house, then the \n\t\thouse will be destroyed. So the Honorable \n\t\tElijah Muhammad is telling the white man get \n\t\tthis powder keg out of your house, let the \n\t\tblack people in this country separate from him \n\t\twhile there's still time. And if the black man \n\t\tis allowed to separate and go on onto some land \n\t\tof his own, where he can solve his problems, \n\t\tthen there won't be any explosion.

HOTEL THERESA - DAY\n \n\tMalcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a roomful \n\tof SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tBecause 1964 threatens to be a very explosive \n\t\tyear on the racial front, and because I myself \n\t\tintend to be very active in every phase of the \n\t\tAmerican Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I \n\t\thave called this press conference, this \n\t\tmorning in order to clarify my own position in \n\t\tthe struggle -- especially in regards to \n\t\tpolitics and nonviolence. In the past I thought \n\t\tthe thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable \n\t\tElijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on \n\t\tI speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. \n\t\tInternal differences within the Nation of Islam \n\t\tforced me out of it. I did not leave of my own \n\t\tfree will. But now that it has happened, I \n\t\tintend to make the most of it. Now that I have \n\t\tmore independence of action, I intend to use a \n\t\tmore flexible approach toward working with \n\t\tothers to get a solution to this problem. I do \n\t\tnot pretend to be a divine man, but I do \n\t\tbelieve in divine guidance, divine power, and \n\t\tin the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not \n\t\teducated, nor am I an expert in any particular \n\t\tfield, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my \n\t\tcredentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro \n\t\tleaders or organizations. We must find a common \n\t\tsolution, to a common problem. I am going to \n\t\torganize and head a new mosque in New York \n\t\tCity, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This \n\t\tgives us a religious base, and the spiritual \n\t\tforce necessary to rid our people of the vices \n\t\tthat destroy the moral fiber of our community. \n\t\tOur political philosophy will be black \n\t\tnationalism. Our economic and social philosophy \n\t\twill be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, \n\t\tInc. will remain wide open for ideas and \n\t\tfinancial aid from all quarters. Whites can \n\t\thelp us, but they can't join us. There can be \n\t\tno black-white unity until there is first some \n\t\tblack unity.\n\n\tA host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers\n\twill join you? etc, etc, etc.\n \n\tMalcolm calms them:\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tThere is one further preparation I need.

I pointed out that what it \n\t\thad done, Islam, for those people despite their \n\t\tcomplexion differences, that it would probably \n\t\tdo America well to study the religion of Islam \n\t\tand perhaps it could drive some of the racism \n\t\tfrom this society. Muslims look upon themselves \n\t\tas human beings, as part of the human family \n\t\tand therefore look upon all other segments of \n\t\tthe human family as part of that same family. \n\t\tToday my friends are black, brown, red, yellow \n\t\tand white.\n \n\t\t\t\tREPORTER #8 \n\t\tMalcolm, are you prepared to go to the United \n\t\tNations at this point and ask that charges be \n\t\tbrought against the United States for its \n\t\ttreatment of the American Negroes?\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tOh yes.\n\n\tThe AUDIENCE applauds.\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM (contd) \n\t\tThe audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I \n\t\tpointed out that during my trip that nations, \n\t\tAfrican nations, Asian, Latin nations look very \n\t\thypocritical when they stand up in the UN \n\t\tcondemning South Africa and saying nothing \n\t\tabout the racist practices that are manifested \n\t\teveryday against Negroes in this society. I \n\t\twould be not a man if I didn't do so.

But I do think that you \n\t\twill And black people in America, as they \n\t\tstrive to throw off the shackles of mental \n\t\tcolonialism, will also probably reflect an \n\t\teffort to throw off the shackles of cultural \n\t\tcolonialism.

Do you still favor \n\t\tthat for self-defense?\n \n\t\t\t\tMALCOLM \n\t\tI don't see why that should be controversial.
