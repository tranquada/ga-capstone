STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823\n</b>\n               Total darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in \n               distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English \n               and occasionally Italian.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me!  \n                         Forgive your assassin! Mozart!\n\n               A faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see \n               an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.  \n               We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the \n               point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a \n               branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is \n               Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and \n               biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is \n               thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is \n               very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and \n               clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles \n               throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, \n               which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles \n               swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon \n               door.\n\n               The Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice \n               goes on, rising in volume.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg \n                         you! Show mercy to a guilty man!\n\n               The Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Open the door, Signore! Please! Be \n                         good now! We've brought you something \n                         special. Something you're going to \n                         love.\n\n               Silence.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come \n                         now. Be good!\n\n               The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, \n               and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! \n                         I confess!\n\n               The two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet \n               hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake \n               from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the \n               stairs.\n\n<b>               EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, \n               five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing \n               couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow \n               is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot, \n               holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are \n               revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or \n               hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.  \n               Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.  \n               The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands \n               there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired \n               Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing \n               gown.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any \n                         longer! I confess! I confess what I \n                         did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir  \n                         I confess! I killed you!\n\n               The door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out, \n               holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your \n                         assassin! Piet\u0088! Piet\u0088! Forgive your \n                         assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! \n                         Forgive!\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                              (looking up to the \n                              window)\n                         That's all right, Signore! He heard \n                         you! He forgave you! He wants you to \n                         go inside now and shut the window!\n\n               Old Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have \n               now stopped and are watching this spectacle.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Come on, Signore! Look what I have \n                         for you! I can't give it to you from \n                         down here, can I?\n\n               Old Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away \n               back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through \n               the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers \n               in the street. They stare back at him in confusion.\n\n<b>                                     BYSTANDER\n</b>                         Who is that?\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         No one, sir. He'll be all right. \n                         Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you \n                         know.\n\n               He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the \n               house. The onlookers keep staring.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, \n               the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Did he open?\n\n               The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks \n               on the door.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Here I am, Signore. Now open the \n                         door.\n\n               He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Mmmm - this is good! This is the \n                         most delicious thing I ever ate, \n                         believe me! Signore, you don't know \n                         what you're missing! Mmmm!\n\n               We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         Now that's enough, Signore! Open!\n\n               We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.\n\n<b>                                     VALET\n</b>                         If you don't open this door, we're \n                         going to eat everything. There'll be \n                         nothing left for you. And I'm not \n                         going to bring you anything more.\n\n               He looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood \n               flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of \n               cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.\n\n               He sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run \n               at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the \n               frail lock gives. The door flies open.\n\n               Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony \n               No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants \n               see.\n\n<b>               INT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open \n               razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive.  \n               He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the \n               room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-\n               piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the \n               Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding \n               throat with a napkin.\n\n<b>               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, \n               full orchestra.\n\n               As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in \n               progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow \n               portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.\n\n<b>               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried \n               out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed \n               in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-\n               aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in \n               beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the \n               wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.\n\n<b>               MONTAGE:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. FOUR STREETS OF VIENNA AND\n</b>\n<b>               INT. THE WAGON - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.  \n               Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, \n               half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants. Doctor \n               Gulden stares at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the \n               General Hospital of Vienna.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               A wide, white-washed corridor. Doctor Gulden is walking down \n               it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but \n               somewhat self-important. This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at \n               the hospital. In the corridor as they walk, we note several \n               patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally. All \n               patients wear white linen smocks. Doctor Gulden wears a dark \n               frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.\n\n<b>                                     DOCTOR GULDEN\n</b>                         He's going to live. It's much harder \n                         to cut your throat than most people \n                         imagine.\n\n               They stop outside a door.\n\n<b>                                     DOCTOR GULDEN\n</b>                         Here we are. Do you wish me to come \n                         in with you?\n\n<b>                                     VOGLER\n</b>                         No, Doctor. Thank you.\n\n               Vogler nods and opens the door.\n\n<b>               INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               A bare room - one of the best available in the General \n               Hospital. It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a \n               small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century. As Vogler \n               enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out \n               the window. His back is to us. The priest closes the door \n               quietly behind him.\n\n<b>                                     VOGLER\n</b>                         Herr Salieri?\n\n               Old Salieri turns around to look at him. We see that his \n               throat is bandaged expertly. He wears hospital garb, and \n               over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later \n               see the EMPEROR invest him.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         What do you want?\n\n<b>                                     VOGLER\n</b>                         I am Father Vogler.

Emperor Joseph - the \n                         musical king!  Within a few years I \n                         was his court composer. Wasn't that \n                         incredible? Imperial Composer to His \n                         Majesty! Actually the man had no ear \n                         at all, but what did it matter? He \n                         adored my music, that was enough. \n                         Night after night I sat right next \n                         to the Emperor of Austria, playing \n                         duets with him, correcting the royal \n                         sight-reading. Tell me, if you had \n                         been me, wouldn't you have thought \n                         God had accepted your vow? And believe \n                         me, I honoured it. I was a model of \n                         virtue. I kept my hands off women, \n                         worked hours every day teaching \n                         students, many of them for free, \n                         sitting on endless committees to \n                         help poor musicians - work and work \n                         and work, that was all my life. And \n                         it was wonderful! Everybody liked \n                         me. I liked myself. I was the most \n                         successful musician in Vienna. And \n                         the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

A small group of Gypsy \n               musicians is playing in the background. Thirteen members of \n               the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with \n               18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, \n               basset horns, etc. and wearing their employer's livery - are \n               laying out music on stands at one end of the room. At the \n               other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the \n               ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG. A throng of people is standing, \n               talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs \n               to hear a concert.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n</b>                         One day he came to Vienna to play \n                         some of his music at the residence \n                         of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop \n                         of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to \n                         seek him out. That night changed my \n                         life.\n\n               We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut \n               man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking \n               through the crowd of guests. We follow him.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n</b>                         As I went through the salon, I played \n                         a game with myself. This man had \n                         written his first concerto at the \n                         age of four; his first symphony at \n                         seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.  \n                         Did it show? Is talent like that \n                         written on the face?\n\n               We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri \n               as he moves through the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n</b>                         Which one of them could he be?\n\n               Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully. Then \n               suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries \n               stalks past. Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, \n               Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon.\n\n<b>               INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n</b>\n               The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft.  \n               Salieri follows him.\n\n               The servant turns into:\n\n<b>               INT.

It is, \n               in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant puts his \n               tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room.\n\n<b>               INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n</b>\n               Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.  \n               As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet \n               room.\n\n<b>               INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S\n</b>\n               Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He \n               is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of \n               sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a \n               huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a \n               pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, \n               but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.  \n               He ducks down behind the pastry table.\n\n               A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight \n               across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.\n\n               After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, \n               stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a \n               fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the \n               Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has \n               disappeared.\n\n               Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when \n               Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny \n               mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling \n               across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. \n               Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under \n               the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a \n               high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart \n               throughout the film.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

Also, a marble mantelpiece above \n               which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure \n               of a severe Christ. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his \n               desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and \n               ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he \n               occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, \n               with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, \n               and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.  \n               There is a knock at the door.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         Si.\n\n               A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears \n               carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.  \n               She has just come from the baker's shop.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         Ah!

On \n               either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding \n               another wig, equally extravagant. Mozart takes off the first \n               wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely \n               proud, and hands it back.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         And the other one?\n\n               The Salesman puts the second wig on his head.

The others, \n               except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the \n               King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly \n               accuracy.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                              (to Salieri)\n                         The rest is just the same, isn't it?\n\n               He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a \n               phrase, which he repeats dubiously.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         That really doesn't work, does it?\n\n               All the courtiers look at Salieri.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Did you try this?

Better.\n\n               He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so \n               that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in \n               The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with \n               increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a \n               fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He \n               finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a \n               gesture of triumph - and grins.\n\n<b>               INT.

Cavalieri sings her next \n               scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises \n               in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral \n               accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il \n               Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from \n               exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.\n\n               We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not \n               merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish \n               manner, and we are on:\n\n<b>               INT.

Watching the performance - which is \n               conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the \n               orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and \n               Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.\n\n               In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and \n               three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable \n               MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and \n               SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber \n               is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, \n               Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.\n\n               Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch \n               du bist entschlossen.\n\n<b>                                     CAVALIERI\n</b>                         Since you are determined, Since you \n                         are determined, Calmly, with no \n                         ferment, Welcome - every pain and \n                         woe.

Showing \n                         off like the greedy songbird she \n                         was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales \n                         and arpeggios, whizzing up and down \n                         like fireworks at a fairground.\n\n               Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.\n\n<b>                                     CAVALIERI\n</b>                              (singing)\n                         Be freed at last by death!

SALIERI'S SALON - LATE AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n</b>\n               CU, The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting. The music begins \n               to sound under the following:\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n</b>                         Displace one note and there would be \n                         diminishment. Displace one phrase, \n                         and the structure would fall. It was \n                         clear to me. That sound I had heard \n                         in the Archbishop's palace had been \n                         no accident. Here again was the very \n                         voice of God! I was staring through \n                         the cage of those meticulous ink-\n                         strokes at an absolute, inimitable \n                         beauty.\n\n               The music swells. What we now hear is an amazing collage of \n               great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and \n               to us. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits \n               happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks \n               around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping \n               them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his \n               agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough \n               and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and \n               great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, \n               scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles \n               the room.\n\n               Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in \n               C Minor. It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable \n               to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut. \n               Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head. \n               He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, \n               perplexed.\n\n<b>                                     CONSTANZE\n</b>                         Is it no good?\n\n               A pause.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         It is miraculous.\n\n<b>                                     CONSTANZE\n</b>                         Oh yes.

Through the far door \n               leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her.  \n               The first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, \n               leaving her alone.\n\n               We stay with her.

To its grand and weighty sound, \n               Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri.  \n               Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting \n               and baffling him. He opens his mouth in distress. The music \n               pounds in his head. The candle flickers over her as she \n               removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace.

The grim opening \n               chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march \n               from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a \n               menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, \n               standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the \n               figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its \n               arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.  \n               It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held \n               before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music \n               continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes \n               joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's \n               arms.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Papa! PAPA!\n\n               Both men embrace. The music slowly fades.\n\n<b>               INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S\n</b>\n               A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied \n               for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many \n               empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a \n               mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white \n               keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.\n\n               Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an \n               aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His \n               face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Why are you here?\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         Am I not welcome?\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Of course, welcome!

The music of \n               Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and \n               persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade \n               above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the \n               bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus:  \n               this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves \n               in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses \n               and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as \n               Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak \n               and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across \n               the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go, \n               they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, \n               wearing ordinary evening clothes.

This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which\n\n               Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The \n               music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has \n               begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing \n               in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music \n               stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who \n               fails must pay a forfeit.\n\n               Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with \n               one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing \n               with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - \n               a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a \n               circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is \n               Salieri.\n\n               Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble \n               for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, \n               bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of \n               it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over-\n               balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze \n               immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and \n               tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But \n               Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.\n\n<b>                                     SCHIKANEDER\n</b>                         No, no! You both lost. You both lost. \n                         You both have to forfeit. And the \n                         penalty is you must exchange your \n                         wigs.\n\n               People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children \n               jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses \n               immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask \n               and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes \n               off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls. \n               Constanze laughingly surrenders it.\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         No, please! This is ridiculous! No, \n                         please!\n\n               Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which \n               the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face \n               showing a very different expression underneath. Another \n               actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on \n               the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig \n               from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         No, really!\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                              (calling to him)\n                         This is just a game, Papa.\n\n               Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.\n\n<b>                                     CONSTANZE\n</b>                         This is just a game, Papa!\n\n               Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the \n               children.\n\n<b>                                     BYSTANDERS\n</b>                         This is just a game, Papa!\n\n               As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds \n               in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody \n               bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's \n               wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a \n               weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he \n               looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.  \n               Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to \n               dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves \n               the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing \n               this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father \n               entreatingly by the arm.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the \n                         fun. Come on. Here, take mine.\n\n               He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered \n               head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat \n               bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He \n               takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the \n               music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto \n               a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; \n               and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder \n               calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.\n\n<b>                                     SCHIKANEDER\n</b>                         Herr Mozart, why don't you name your \n                         son's penalty?\n\n               Applause.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         Yes, Papa, name it.

Mozart smiles \n               at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He \n               defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his \n               back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the \n               company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. \n               His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, \n               and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant \n               fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been \n               dancing.\n\n               Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer \n               to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of \n               the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold \n               sits by himself, sulking.\n\n               The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out \n               to Mozart.\n\n<b>                                     GUESTS\n</b>                         Another! Do another!

Then, \n               watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.\n\n               He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his \n               eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, \n               in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a \n               totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and \n               dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence \n               of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts \n               to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri \n               stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks \n               challengingly back at him.\n\n               Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a \n               fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this \n               up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly \n               he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands \n               up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his \n               breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl \n               of laughter.\n\n               CU, Salieri staring in pain.\n\n<b>               INT.

Inside we see one gold \n               snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with \n               as a child in the Vatican.\n\n<b>                                     LORL\n</b>                         He kept seven snuff boxes in here.  \n                         I could swear they were all gold. \n                         And now look there's only one left. \n                         And inside, sir, look - I counted \n                         them - tickets from the pawnshop. \n                         Six of them.\n\n               Salieri turns to look around him.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         Where does he work?\n\n<b>                                     LORL\n</b>                         In there, sir.\n\n               She points across the room to the workroom.

He is \n               immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' \n               picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a \n               discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important \n               to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, \n               he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches \n               the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its \n               half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were \n               the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls \n               on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them \n               up.\n\n               CU, The pages.\n\n               We see words set to music. Against each line of notes is the \n               name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino. Then \n               another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand.\n\n               Le Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in \n               quattro atti.\n\n               CU, The word Figaro.\n\n               CU, Salieri.

The \n               Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger \n               to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into \n               a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno.\n\n               The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed.\n\n               The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is \n               silence. Mozart lays down his baton. The musicians lay down \n               their instruments. The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come \n               in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to \n               come presently to a halt, lacking their music. The singers \n               try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their \n               conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks \n               lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. \n               Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators.

Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now \n               about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are \n               watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe. They are \n               rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and \n               tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. \n               Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates \n               of sausages, etc.\n\n<b>               THE PARODY\n</b>\n               On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don \n               Giovanni's palace, shown before.\n\n               Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three \n               actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), \n               played by a quartet of tipsy musicians.

Then all musicians, actresses, Don \n               Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table \n               which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table \n               rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes \n               elaborately.

It has a ridiculous \n               expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing \n               precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature \n               version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore.  \n               He sings in a high, nasal voice:\n\n<b>                                     COMMENDATORE\n</b>                              (singing)\n                         Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!\n\n               He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails.

There is \n               a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end \n               and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the \n               horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don \n               Giovanni.

The horse's rear-end swings \n               around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to \n               the audience. The rest of him stays sideways. His tail springs \n               up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding \n               his arsehole.\n\n               Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay.

Another handful of hay and out \n               of the other end falls a string of sausages. Then a large \n               pie, crust and all. Then a shower of iced cakes! \n\n               Suddenly - silence. Schikaneder produces an egg from his \n               pocket.

A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the \n               tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the \n               horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.\n\n               Wild applause.\n\n               It flies into the audience.

Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins \n               to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and \n               magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse \n               strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole \n               company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the \n               curtain falls.\n\n               It rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is \n               delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow \n               amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he \n               finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience \n               toward the table where Mozart sits with his family.

To the music \n               of the slow introduction, we see:\n\n<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n</b>\n               The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty. The camera \n               shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down \n               upon a scene of disorder.\n\n               Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the \n               fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, \n               woven with symbols. To the more lyrical passage of the \n               introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:\n\n<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n</b>\n               We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart \n               now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Tenderly he \n               touches her hair. Then he moves to the cot where his son \n               Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little \n               blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the \n               boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart \n               rises and returns to:\n\n<b>               INT.

Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: \n               gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait, \n               and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an \n               irresponsible and happy boy again.\n\n               Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The \n               music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door. \n               The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the \n               happy music. It ends. Before him stands the masked stranger.\n\n<b>                                     MOZART\n</b>                         I don't have it yet. It's not \n                         finished.

He looks up and sees that \n               Constanze is fast asleep in her chair. Mozart gets up quietly.  \n               He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and \n               tiptoes from the house. Without stopping, the music changes \n               from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the \n               Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT.

Inside, we see a table, chairs, a \n               forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. Strewn about in \n               the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. Schikaneder \n               and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird-\n               people. The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a \n               soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard. Absurdly, \n               they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Papageno, played by Schikaneder, \n               dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through \n               a mysterious door. A voice calls from within.\n\n<b>                                     VOICE\n</b>                         Go back!\n\n               Papageno recoils.\n\n<b>                                     PAPAGENO\n</b>                         Merciful Gods!

Oh, this is awful!\n\n               He weeps extravagantly.\n\n               In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take \n               over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily \n               backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno \n               being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST PRIEST\n</b>                              (on stage)\n                         Man, thou hast deserved to wander \n                         forever in the darkest chasms of the \n                         earth.

Just \n                         give me a decent glass of wine - \n                         that's divine content enough for me.\n\n               Laughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.\n\n               We follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand \n               around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and \n               parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of \n               a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. \n               Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel \n               with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. \n               Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the \n               instrument himself.\n\n               On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the \n               First Priest.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST PRIEST\n</b>                         Man, hast thou no other desire on \n                         earth, but just to eat and drink?\n\n<b>                                     PAPAGENO\n</b>                              (Schikaneder)\n                         Well!\n\n               Laughter from the audience.\n\n<b>                                     PAPAGENO\n</b>                         Well, actually I do have a rather \n                         weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps \n                         it's just indigestion. But you know, \n                         I really would like - I really do \n                         want - something even nicer than \n                         food and drink. Now what on earth \n                         could that be?\n\n               He stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh.\n\n               Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It \n               is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, \n               with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by \n               Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart \n               conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation \n               with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches \n               entranced.\n\n<b>                                     ANDANTE\n</b>                         A sweetheart or a pretty little wife \n                         is Papageno's wish.

Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and \n               no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He \n               looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.  \n               People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a \n               near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to \n               the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At \n               this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S\n</b>\n               We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered \n               cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a \n               hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly \n               down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.\n\n               A few people around him are trying to revive him. One has \n               put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding \n               a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying, \n               'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage. \n               Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a \n               distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of \n               Salieri.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         I'll take care of him.\n\n               He steps forward.\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         I have a carriage. Excuse me.\n\n               The actors step back respectfully. He stoops and picks up \n               the frail composer in his arms. Mozart is quite limp and \n               Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. All this \n               is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing \n               his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman.\n\n<b>                                     UGLY OLD WOMAN\n</b>                         Here I am, my angel.\n\n<b>                                     PAPAGENO\n</b>                              (appalled)\n                         What?

Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is \n               pouring from his forehead.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed \n               in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is \n               obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped \n               position.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Startled by Constanze's \n               entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does \n               so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, \n               so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look \n               absurd.\n\n<b>                                     CONSTANZE\n</b>                         What are you doing here?\n\n<b>                                     SALIERI\n</b>                         Your husband is ill, ma'am.

Mozart \n               makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. The coins \n               brought by Salieri fall on the floor.

The coffin is borne \n               by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes. They \n               load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse.

Understand that. \n                         God cares nothing for the man He \n                         denies and nothing either for the \n                         man He uses. He broke Mozart in half \n                         when He'd finished with him, and \n                         threw him away. Like an old, worn \n                         out flute.\n\n<b>               EXT. CEMETERY OF ST. MARX - LATE AFTERNOON - 1790'S\n</b>\n               The rain has eased off. A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes \n               is standing beside an open communal grave. Mozart's body is \n               lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.\n\n               We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. The \n               gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the \n               others. An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of \n               them. The acolytes swing their censers.\n\n<b>                                     LOCAL PRIEST\n</b>                         The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh \n                         away.

Thirty-two years \n                         of honours and awards.\n\n               He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the \n               Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and \n               throws it across the room.\n\n<b>                                     OLD SALIERI\n</b>                         Being bowed to and saluted, called \n                         'distinguished - distinguished \n                         Salieri' - by men incapable of \n                         distinguishing! Thirty-two years of \n                         meaningless fame to end up alone in \n                         my room, watching myself become \n                         extinct.

They form a long, wretched, strange procession - \n               some of them are clearly very disturbed.
