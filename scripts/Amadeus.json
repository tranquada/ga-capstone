STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823\n\n               Total darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in \n               distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English \n               and occasionally Italian.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me!  \n                         Forgive your assassin! Mozart!\n\n               A faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see \n               an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.  \n               We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the \n               point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a \n               branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is \n               Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and \n               biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is \n               thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is \n               very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and \n               clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles \n               throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, \n               which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles \n               swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon \n               door.\n\n               The Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice \n               goes on, rising in volume.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg \n                         you! Show mercy to a guilty man!\n\n               The Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Open the door, Signore! Please! Be \n                         good now! We've brought you something \n                         special. Something you're going to \n                         love.\n\n               Silence.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come \n                         now. Be good!\n\n               The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, \n               and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! \n                         I confess!\n\n               The two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet \n               hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake \n               from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the \n               stairs.\n\n               EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT\n\n               The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, \n               five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing \n               couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow \n               is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot, \n               holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are \n               revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or \n               hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.  \n               Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.  \n               The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands \n               there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired \n               Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing \n               gown.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any \n                         longer! I confess! I confess what I \n                         did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir  \n                         I confess! I killed you!\n\n               The door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out, \n               holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your \n                         assassin! Piet\u0088! Piet\u0088! Forgive your \n                         assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! \n                         Forgive!\n\n                                     VALET\n                              (looking up to the \n                              window)\n                         That's all right, Signore! He heard \n                         you! He forgave you! He wants you to \n                         go inside now and shut the window!\n\n               Old Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have \n               now stopped and are watching this spectacle.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Come on, Signore! Look what I have \n                         for you! I can't give it to you from \n                         down here, can I?\n\n               Old Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away \n               back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through \n               the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers \n               in the street. They stare back at him in confusion.\n\n                                     BYSTANDER\n                         Who is that?\n\n                                     VALET\n                         No one, sir. He'll be all right. \n                         Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you \n                         know.\n\n               He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the \n               house. The onlookers keep staring.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT\n\n               The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, \n               the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Did he open?\n\n               The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks \n               on the door.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Here I am, Signore. Now open the \n                         door.\n\n               He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Mmmm - this is good! This is the \n                         most delicious thing I ever ate, \n                         believe me! Signore, you don't know \n                         what you're missing! Mmmm!\n\n               We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         Now that's enough, Signore! Open!\n\n               We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.\n\n                                     VALET\n                         If you don't open this door, we're \n                         going to eat everything. There'll be \n                         nothing left for you. And I'm not \n                         going to bring you anything more.\n\n               He looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood \n               flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of \n               cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.\n\n               He sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run \n               at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the \n               frail lock gives. The door flies open.\n\n               Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony \n               No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants \n               see.\n\n               INT. OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT\n\n               Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open \n               razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive.  \n               He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the \n               room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-\n               piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the \n               Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding \n               throat with a napkin.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, \n               full orchestra.\n\n               As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in \n               progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow \n               portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.\n\n               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried \n               out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed \n               in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-\n               aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in \n               beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the \n               wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.\n\n               MONTAGE:\n\n               EXT. FOUR STREETS OF VIENNA AND\n\n               INT. THE WAGON - NIGHT\n\n               The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.  \n               Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, \n               half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants. Doctor \n               Gulden stares at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the \n               General Hospital of Vienna.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               A wide, white-washed corridor. Doctor Gulden is walking down \n               it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but \n               somewhat self-important. This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at \n               the hospital. In the corridor as they walk, we note several \n               patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally. All \n               patients wear white linen smocks. Doctor Gulden wears a dark \n               frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.\n\n                                     DOCTOR GULDEN\n                         He's going to live. It's much harder \n                         to cut your throat than most people \n                         imagine.\n\n               They stop outside a door.\n\n                                     DOCTOR GULDEN\n                         Here we are. Do you wish me to come \n                         in with you?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         No, Doctor. Thank you.\n\n               Vogler nods and opens the door.\n\n               INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               A bare room - one of the best available in the General \n               Hospital. It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a \n               small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century. As Vogler \n               enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out \n               the window. His back is to us. The priest closes the door \n               quietly behind him.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         Herr Salieri?\n\n               Old Salieri turns around to look at him. We see that his \n               throat is bandaged expertly. He wears hospital garb, and \n               over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later \n               see the EMPEROR invest him.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain \n                         here. I thought you might like to \n                         talk to someone.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         About what?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         You tried to take your life.

Gravely.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Leave me alone.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         I cannot leave alone a soul in pain.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Do you know who I am? You never heard \n                         of me, did you?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         That makes no difference. All men \n                         are equal in God's eyes.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Are they?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         Offer me your confession.

A SALON IN THE VATICAN - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               We see the six-year-old MOZART, also blindfolded, seated in \n               a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord \n               for the POPE and a suite of CARDINALS and other churchmen. \n               Beside the little boy stands LEOPOLD, his father, smirking \n               with pride.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         I admit I was jealous when I heard \n                         the tales they told about him. Not \n                         of the brilliant little prodigy \n                         himself, but of his father, who had \n                         taught him everything.\n\n               The piece finishes. Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord \n               and lifts up his little son to stand on it. Mozart removes \n               the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes.  \n               Both father and son bow. A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold \n               with a gold snuff box whilst the cardinals decorously applaud.  \n               Over this scene Old Salieri speaks.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         My father did not care for music. He \n                         wanted me only to be a merchant, \n                         like himself. As anonymous as he \n                         was. When I told how I wished I could \n                         be like Mozart, he would say, Why? \n                         Do you want to be a trained monkey? \n                         Would you like me to drag you around \n                         Europe doing tricks like a circus \n                         freak?

THE CHURCH AT LEGNAGO - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The music continues and swells. We see the twelve-year-old \n               Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the \n               congregation, listening in rapture. His father is a heavy-\n               looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the \n               music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over \n               the altar. Candles burn below his image.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         Even then a spray of sounded notes \n                         could make me dizzy, almost to \n                         falling.\n\n               The boy falls forward on his knees. So do his parents and \n               the other members of the congregation.

Father Salieri \n               sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin. \n               Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing \n               them round. Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black, \n               and of course the young boy. Father Salieri receives his \n               plate of fish and starts to eat greedily. Suddenly there is \n               a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone. All \n               the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling \n               him, but it is in vain. Father Salieri collapses.\n\n               INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 1823\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Suddenly he was dead. Just like that! \n                         And my life changed forever. My mother \n                         said, Go. Study music if you really \n                         want to. Off with you! And off I \n                         went as quick as I could and never \n                         saw Italy again. Of course, I knew \n                         God had arranged it all; that was \n                         obvious. One moment I was a frustrated \n                         boy in an obscure little town. The \n                         next I was here, in Vienna, city of \n                         musicians, sixteen years old and \n                         studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father. \n                         Do you know who he was? The greatest \n                         composer of his time. And he loved \n                         me! That was the wonder. He taught \n                         me everything he knew. And when I \n                         was ready, introduced me personally \n                         to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the \n                         musical king!  Within a few years I \n                         was his court composer. Wasn't that \n                         incredible? Imperial Composer to His \n                         Majesty! Actually the man had no ear \n                         at all, but what did it matter? He \n                         adored my music, that was enough. \n                         Night after night I sat right next \n                         to the Emperor of Austria, playing \n                         duets with him, correcting the royal \n                         sight-reading. Tell me, if you had \n                         been me, wouldn't you have thought \n                         God had accepted your vow? And believe \n                         me, I honoured it. I was a model of \n                         virtue. I kept my hands off women, \n                         worked hours every day teaching \n                         students, many of them for free, \n                         sitting on endless committees to \n                         help poor musicians - work and work \n                         and work, that was all my life. And \n                         it was wonderful! Everybody liked \n                         me. I liked myself. I was the most \n                         successful musician in Vienna. And \n                         the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. THE ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG'S RESIDENCE - VIENNA - DAY - \n               1780'S\n\n               A grand room crowded with guests. A small group of Gypsy \n               musicians is playing in the background. Thirteen members of \n               the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with \n               18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, \n               basset horns, etc. and wearing their employer's livery - are \n               laying out music on stands at one end of the room. At the \n               other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the \n               ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG. A throng of people is standing, \n               talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs \n               to hear a concert.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         One day he came to Vienna to play \n                         some of his music at the residence \n                         of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop \n                         of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to \n                         seek him out. That night changed my \n                         life.\n\n               We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut \n               man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking \n               through the crowd of guests. We follow him.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         As I went through the salon, I played \n                         a game with myself. This man had \n                         written his first concerto at the \n                         age of four; his first symphony at \n                         seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.  \n                         Did it show? Is talent like that \n                         written on the face?\n\n               We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri \n               as he moves through the crowd.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         Which one of them could he be?\n\n               Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully. Then \n               suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries \n               stalks past. Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, \n               Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon.\n\n               INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft.  \n               Salieri follows him.\n\n               The servant turns into:\n\n               INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri's POV: several tables, dressed to the floor with \n               cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery. It is, \n               in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant puts his \n               tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room.\n\n               INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.  \n               As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet \n               room.\n\n               INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He \n               is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of \n               sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a \n               huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a \n               pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, \n               but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.  \n               He ducks down behind the pastry table.\n\n               A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight \n               across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.\n\n               After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, \n               stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a \n               fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the \n               Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has \n               disappeared.\n\n               Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when \n               Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny \n               mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling \n               across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. \n               Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under \n               the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a \n               high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart \n               throughout the film.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The throng is mostly seated. The musicians are in their \n               places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments; \n               the candles are all lit. A Majordomo appears and bangs his \n               staff on the floor for attention. Immediately COLLOREDO, \n               Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg enters. He is a small self-\n               important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet \n               skullcap. He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO. \n               Everyone stands. The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. \n               His guests sit also. Arco gives the signal to start the music. \n               Nothing happens. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches \n               the Chamberlain and whispers in his ear. Arco in turn whispers \n               to the Archbishop.\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         Mozart is not here.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         Where is he?\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         They're looking for him, Your Grace.\n\n               INT.

There is puzzlement and a murmur \n               of comment. The Archbishop tightens his lip.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                              (to Arco)\n                         We'll start without him.\n\n               INT.   PALACE BUFFET ROOM - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Mozart is on his knees before the tablecloth, which reaches \n               to the floor. Under it is Constanze. We hear her giggling as \n               he talks.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Miaouw! Miaouw! Mouse-wouse?

The leader yields his place to the composer and \n               Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.\n\n               Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats \n               herself at the back.\n\n               INT. PALACE BUFFET ROOM - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The music fades down. Salieri stands shocked from his \n               inadvertent eavesdropping. After a second he moves almost in \n               a trance toward the door; the music dissolves.\n\n               INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), \n               guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. The squeezebox  \n               opening of the movement begins. Salieri appears at the door \n               at the back of the salon. He stares in disbelief at Mozart.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         So that was he! That giggling, dirty-\n                         minded creature I'd just seen crawling \n                         on the floor. Mozart. The phenomenon \n                         whose legend had haunted my youth.  \n                         Impossible.\n\n               The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - \n               amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound. Finally \n               it fades down and away and changes into applause. Salieri \n               opens his eyes.\n\n               The audience is clearly delighted. Mozart bows to them, also \n               delighted. Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at \n               Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon. Count Arco \n               approaches the composer. Mozart turns to him, radiant.\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         Follow me, please. The Archbishop \n                         would like a word.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Certainly!\n\n               He follows Arco out of the room, through a throng of admirers.\n\n               INT. ANOTHER PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Mozart and Arco walk side by side. They pass Salieri who is \n               staring at Mozart in fascination. As they disappear, he steals \n               toward the music stands, unable to help himself.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Well, I think that went off remarkably \n                         well, don't you?\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         Indeed.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         These Viennese certainly know good \n                         music when they hear it.\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         His Grace is very angry with you.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         What do you mean?\n\n               They arrive at the door of Colloredo's private apartment.\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         You are to come in here and ask his \n                         pardon.\n\n               Arco opens the door.\n\n               INT. ARCHBISHOP'S PRIVATE ROOM - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The Archbishop is sitting, chatting to quests. Among them \n               are several ladies. Arco approaches him obsequiously.\n\n                                     ARCO\n                         Your Grace.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         Ah, Mozart.

The more license I allow \n                         you, the more you take.\n\n               The company watches this scene, deeply interested.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         If His Grace is not satisfied with \n                         me, he can dismiss me.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         I wish you to return immediately to \n                         Salzburg. Your father is waiting for \n                         you there patiently. I will speak to \n                         you further when I come.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         No, Your Grace! I mean with all \n                         humility, no. I would rather you \n                         dismissed me. It's obvious I don't \n                         satisfy.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         Then try harder, Mozart. I have no \n                         intention of dismissing you. You \n                         will remain in my service and learn \n                         your place. Go now.\n\n               He extends his hand to be kissed. Mozart does it with a \n               furious grace, then leaves the room. As he opens the door we \n               see:\n\n               INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               A group of people who have attended the concert, among them \n               Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At \n               sight of the composer they break into sustained applause.  \n               Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open\n\n               so that the guests can see into the private apartment where \n               the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is \n               clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He \n               smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small \n               ovation.\n\n               Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line \n               of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause \n               for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly \n               irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and \n               shuts the door, ending the applause.\n\n               INT. PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the \n               full score of the Serenade. He turns the pages back to the \n               slow movement. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.\n\n               CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless \n               fascination. The music is played against his description of \n               it.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         Extraordinary! On the page it looked \n                         nothing. The beginning simple, almost \n                         comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and \n                         basset horns - like a rusty \n                         squeezebox. Then suddenly - high \n                         above it - an oboe, a single note, \n                         hanging there unwavering, till a \n                         clarinet took over and sweetened it \n                         into a phrase of such delight! This \n                         was no composition by a performing \n                         monkey! This was a music I'd never \n                         heard. Filled with such longing, \n                         such unfulfillable longing, it had \n                         me trembling. It seemed to me that I \n                         was hearing a voice of God.\n\n               Suddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he \n               lays down the score.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Excuse me!\n\n               He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room.  \n               Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little \n               figure.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         But why?\n\n               INT.

Also, a marble mantelpiece above \n               which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure \n               of a severe Christ. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his \n               desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and \n               ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he \n               occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, \n               with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, \n               and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.  \n               There is a knock at the door.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Si.\n\n               A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears \n               carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.  \n               She has just come from the baker's shop.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, \n                         good morning.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         Good morning, sir.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         What have you got for me today? Let \n                         me see.\n\n               Greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Ah-ha! Siena macaroons - my \n                         favourites. Give my best thanks to \n                         the baker.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         I will, sir.\n\n               He takes a biscuit and eats.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Thank you. Are you well today, \n                         Fraulein Lorl?\n\n                                     LORL\n                         Yes, thank you, sir.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Bene! Bene!\n\n               She gives a little curtsey, flattered and giggling and is \n               shown out. Salieri turns back to his work, chewing. He plays \n               through a complete line of the march. He smiles, pleased \n               with the result.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Grazie, Signore.\n\n               He inclines his head to the Christ above the  fireplace, and \n               starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which \n               pleased him.\n\n               INT. A WIGMAKER'S SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, \n               seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig. On \n               either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding \n               another wig, equally extravagant. Mozart takes off the first \n               wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely \n               proud, and hands it back.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         And the other one?\n\n               The Salesman puts the second wig on his head. Mozart pulls a \n               face of doubt in the mirror.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         And the other one?\n\n               He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the \n               first wig on his head.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh, they're both so beautiful, I \n                         can't decide. Why don't I have two \n                         heads?\n\n               He giggles. The music stops.\n\n               INT. GRAND SALON - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               A door opens. We glimpse in the next room the Emperor Joseph \n               bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing \n               around a table.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Good, good, good.\n\n               He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits \n               him. It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von \n               Swieten and Salieri. The room contains several gilded chairs \n               dotted about, and a forte-piano.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Good morning, gentlemen.\n\n               All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty!\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                              (to Von Strack)\n                         Well, what do you have for me today?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Yes, what about him?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         He's here.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Ah-ha. Well. There it is. Good.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Majesty, I hope you won't think it \n                         improper, but I have written a little \n                         March of Welcome in his honour.\n\n               He produces a paper.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         What a charming idea. May I see?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                              (handing it over)\n                         It's just a trifle, of course.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         May I try it?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Majesty.\n\n               The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first \n               bars of it. Quite well.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Delightful, Court Composer. Would \n                         you permit me to play it as he comes \n                         in?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         You do me too much honour, Sire.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Let's have some fun.\n                              (to the waiting \n                              Majordomo)\n                         Bring in Herr Mozart, please. But \n                         slowly, slowly. I need a minute to \n                         practice.\n\n               The Majordomo bows and goes. The Emperor addresses himself \n               to the march. He plays a wrong note.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         A-flat, Majesty.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Ah-ha!\n\n               INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching \n               very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a \n               bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of \n               the wigs from the perruqier.\n\n               INT. ROYAL PALACE GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Joseph finishes the march. The door opens.\n\n                                     MAJORDOMO\n                         Herr Mozart.\n\n               Mozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played \n               by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with \n               admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely \n               to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the \n               scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. \n               It finishes and all clap obsequiously.\n\n                                     ORSINI-ROSENBERG\n                         Bravo, Your Majesty!\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         Well done, Sire!\n\n               The Emperor rises, pleased with himself. He snatches the \n               manuscript off the stand and holds it in his hand for the \n               rest of the scene.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Gentlemen, gentlemen, a little less \n                         enthusiasm, I beg you. Ah, Mozart.\n\n               He extends his hand. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and \n               to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Your Majesty!\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         No, no, please! It is not a holy \n                         relic.\n                              (raising Mozart up)\n                         You know we have met already? In \n                         this very room. Perhaps you won't \n                         remember it, you were only six years \n                         old.\n                              (to the others)\n                         He was giving the most brilliant \n                         little concert here. As he got off \n                         the stool, he slipped and fell. My \n                         sister Antoinette helped him up \n                         herself, and do you know what he \n                         did? Jumped straight into her arms \n                         and said, Will you marry me, yes or \n                         no?\n\n               Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps \n               him out.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         You know all these gentlemen, I'm \n                         sure.\n\n               Von Strack and Bonno nod.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         The Baron Von Swieten.\n\n                                     VON SWIETEN\n                         I'm a great admirer of yours, young \n                         man.

The honour is mine.  \n                         Absolutely.\n\n               Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         And here is our illustrious Court \n                         Composer, Herr Salieri.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                              (taking his hand)\n                         Finally!

Well, \n                         tell him, Mozart.

Let it be German.\n\n               He nods - he has wanted this result all the time. He turns \n               and makes for the door. All bow. Then he becomes aware of \n               the manuscript in his hand.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Ah, this is yours.\n\n               Mozart does not take it.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Keep it, Sire, if you want to.

The others, \n               except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the \n               King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly \n               accuracy.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                              (to Salieri)\n                         The rest is just the same, isn't it?\n\n               He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a \n               phrase, which he repeats dubiously.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         That really doesn't work, does it?\n\n               All the courtiers look at Salieri.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Did you try this? Wouldn't it be \n                         just a little more -?\n\n               He plays another phrase.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Or this - yes, this! Better.\n\n               He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so \n               that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in \n               The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with \n               increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a \n               fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He \n               finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a \n               gesture of triumph - and grins.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               We see the olivewood cross.

She sings a scale, expertly. He strikes \n               another chord. She starts another scale, then breaks off.\n\n                                     CAVALIERI\n                         What does he look like?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         You might be disappointed.\n\n                                     CAVALIERI\n                         Why?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Looks and talent don't always go \n                         together, Katherina.\n\n                                     CAVALIERI\n                              (airily)\n                         Looks don't concern me, Maestro.  \n                         Only talent interests a woman of \n                         taste.\n\n               He strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next \n               scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises \n               in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral \n               accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il \n               Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from \n               exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.\n\n               We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not \n               merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish \n               manner, and we are on:\n\n               INT.

Watching the performance - which is \n               conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the \n               orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and \n               Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.\n\n               In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and \n               three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable \n               MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and \n               SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber \n               is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, \n               Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.\n\n               Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch \n               du bist entschlossen.\n\n                                     CAVALIERI\n                         Since you are determined, Since you \n                         are determined, Calmly, with no \n                         ferment, Welcome - every pain and \n                         woe.

Showing \n                         off like the greedy songbird she \n                         was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales \n                         and arpeggios, whizzing up and down \n                         like fireworks at a fairground.\n\n               Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.\n\n                                     CAVALIERI\n                              (singing)\n                         Be freed at last by death!

THE OPERA HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us.  \n               All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with \n               happy excitement.\n\n                                     CAST OF SERAGLIO\n                              (singing)\n                         Pasha Selim May he Live forever! \n                         Ever, ever, ever, ever!

The Emperor claps vigorously \n               and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains \n               part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back. He \n               skips up onto the stage amongst them. The curtains fall again \n               as they all bow. In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, \n               filling it with light.\n\n               INT.

Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching \n               from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack, \n               Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow \n               him. Also Salieri. The singers line up.

She stares at \n               him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.\n\n                                     MADAME WEBER\n                         Oh!\n\n               Mozart moves forward quickly.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Majesty, this is Madame Weber.

She is the fiancee \n                         of Herr Mozart.\n\n               Constanze curtsies. CU, of Cavalieri, astonished at the news. \n               CU, of Salieri, watching her receive it.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Really? How delightful.

Not altogether.\n\n               He giggles uncomfortably.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Excuse me, but how old are you?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Twenty-six.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Well, my advice is to marry this \n                         charming young lady and stay with us \n                         in Vienna.\n\n                                     MADAME WEBER\n                         You see? You see? I've told him that, \n                         Your Majesty, but he won't listen to \n                         me.\n\n               Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart. Mozart looks hastily away \n               from her.\n\n                                     MADAME WEBER\n                         Oh, Your Majesty, you give such \n                         wonderful - such impeccable - such \n                         royal advice. I - I - May I?\n\n               She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead.  \n               The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a \n               pace.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Well. There it is. Strack.\n\n               He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his \n               Chamberlain. All bow.\n\n               Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the \n               stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her \n               plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second, \n               indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                              (to Mozart)\n                         Get some water!\n\n               He hurries away. The daughters gather around Madame Weber.\n\n               INT. CAVALIERI'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               Katherina sits fuming at her mirror. A dresser is taking the \n               pins out of her wig as she stares straight ahead of her. \n               Mozart sticks his head round the door.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Katherina!

OPERA HOUSE STAGE - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               Constanze and Mozart make their way quickly through a crowd \n               of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying \n               bits of the dismantled set of Seraglio. We see all the turmoil \n               of backstage after a performance.\n\n               A fireman passes Mozart carrying a small bucket of water. \n               Mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the \n               crowd to Madame Weber, who still lies prone on the stage. \n\n               Mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws \n               water on her face. She is instantly revived by the shock. \n               Constanze assists her to rise.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Are you all right?\n\n               Instead of being furious, Madame Weber smiles at them \n               rapturously.\n\n                                     MADAME WEBER\n                         Ah, what an evening!

Good night, \n                         Signore.\n\n               Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door.

What was \n                         God up to? Here I was denying all my \n                         natural lust in order to deserve \n                         God's gift and there was Mozart \n                         indulging his in all directions - \n                         even though engaged to be married! - \n                         and no rebuke at all! Was it possible \n                         I was being tested? Was God expecting \n                         me to offer forgiveness in the face \n                         of every offense, no matter how \n                         painful? That was very possible. All \n                         the same, why him? Why use Mozart to \n                         teach me lessons in humility? My \n                         heart was filling up with such hatred \n                         for that little man. For the first \n                         time in my life I began to know really \n                         violent thoughts.

Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man \n               of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         No! I won't have him back.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         But he needs to be here in Salzburg, \n                         Your Grace. He needs me and he needs \n                         you. Your protection, your \n                         understanding.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         Hardly.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the \n                         worst mistake of his life. Some little \n                         Viennese slut is trying to trick him \n                         into marriage. I know my son. He is \n                         too simple to see the trap - and \n                         there is no one there who really \n                         cares for him.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         I'm not surprised. Money seems to be \n                         more important to him than loyalty \n                         or friendship. He has sold himself \n                         to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for \n                         him.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Sir -\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, \n                         conceited brat.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't \n                         blame him. The fault is mine. I was \n                         too indulgent with him. But not again.  \n                         Never again, I promise! I implore \n                         you - let me bring him back here. \n                         I'll make him give his word to serve \n                         you faithfully.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         And how will you make him keep it?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Oh, sir, he's never disobeyed me in \n                         anything. Please, Your Grace, give \n                         him one more chance.\n\n                                     COLLOREDO\n                         You have leave to try.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace!  \n                         I thank you!\n\n               In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He \n               motions Leopold to rise. We hear the first dark fortissimo \n               chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme \n               associated with the character of the Commendatore.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD (V.O.)\n                         My dear son.\n\n               The second fortissimo chord sounds.\n\n               INT. A BAROQUE CHURCH - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               We see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down, \n               as if reading his father's letter. We hear Leopold's voice \n               over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but \n               impressive.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD (V.O.)\n                         I write to you with urgent news. I \n                         am coming to Vienna. Take no further \n                         steps toward marriage until we meet. \n                         You are too gullible to see your own \n                         danger. As you honour the father who \n                         has devoted his entire life to yours, \n                         do as I bid, and await my coming.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         I will.\n\n               The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling \n               beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame \n               Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among \n               them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS \n               WALDSTADTEN.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         And will you, Constanze Weber, take \n                         this man, Wolfgang to be your lawful \n                         husband?\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         I will.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         I now pronounce you man and wife.\n\n               The opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard.  \n               Mozart and Constanze kiss. They are in tears. Madame Weber \n               and her daughters look on approvingly. The music swells and \n               continues under the following:\n\n               INT. A ROOM IN LEOPOLD'S HOUSE - SALZBURG - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               There is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone \n               in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his \n               feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not \n               now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter \n               and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of \n               the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made \n               for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented \n               to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we \n               see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the \n               familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl \n               seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture \n               of their mother on the wall behind them.\n\n                                     MOZART (V.O.)\n                         Most beloved father, it is done. Do \n                         not blame me that I did not wait to \n                         see your dear face. I knew you would \n                         have tried to dissuade me from my \n                         truest happiness and I could not \n                         have borne it. Your every word is \n                         precious to me. Remember how you \n                         have always told me Vienna is the \n                         City of Musicians. To conquer here \n                         is to conquer Europe! With my wife I \n                         can do it.  I vow I will become \n                         regular in my habits and productive \n                         as never before. She is wonderful, \n                         Papa, and I know that you will love \n                         her. And one day soon when I am a \n                         wealthy man, you will come and live \n                         with us, and we will be so happy. I \n                         long for that day, best of Papas, \n                         and kiss your hand a hundred thousand \n                         times.\n\n               The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter \n               in his hand.\n\n               EXT. THE IMPERIAL GARDENS - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri stands waiting, hat in hand. Beside him stands a \n               royal servant. Behind him, gardeners are glimpsed tending \n               the shrubs and bushes along a grassy ride. Down this ride \n               are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph \n               and his niece, the PRINCESS ELIZABETH. They are mounted on \n               glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside \n               her is a panting groom. The Emperor rides elegantly; his \n               niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack \n               of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and \n               the groom holds the head of the Princess' horse. Salieri \n               bows respectfully.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Good morning, Court Composer. This \n                         is my niece, the Princess Elizabeth.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Your Highness.\n\n               Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         She has asked me to advise her on a \n                         suitable musical instructor. I think \n                         I've come up with an excellent idea.\n\n               He smiles at Salieri.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a \n                         tremendous honour!\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         I'm thinking about Herr Mozart.  \n                         What is your view?\n\n               Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         An interesting idea, Majesty. But -\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Yes?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         You already commissioned an opera \n                         from Mozart.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         And the result satisfies.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Yes, of course. My concern is to \n                         protect you from any suspicion of \n                         favouritism.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want \n                         Mozart.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. \n                         Some kind of a little contest. I \n                         could perhaps put together a small \n                         Committee, and I could see to it \n                         naturally that it will select \n                         according to Your Majesty's wishes.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         You please me, Court Composer. A \n                         very clever idea.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                              (bowing)\n                         Sire.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Well. There it is.\n\n               He rides on. The groom releases her horse's head, and runs \n               on after the Princess.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. CHAMBERLAIN VON STRACK'S STUDY - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Von Strack sits stiffly behind his gilded desk. Mozart stands \n               before him, trembling with anger.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         What is this, Herr Chamberlain?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         What is what?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Why do I have to submit samples of \n                         my work to some stupid committee?  \n                         Just to teach a sixteen-year-old \n                         girl.\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         Because His Majesty wishes it.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Is the Emperor angry with me?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         On the contrary.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Then why doesn't he simply appoint \n                         me to the post?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         Mozart, you are not the only composer \n                         in Vienna.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         No, but I'm the best.\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         A little modesty would suit you \n                         better.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Who is on this committee?\n\n                                     VON STRACK\n                         Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini-\n                         Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Naturally, the Italians!

The music begins \n               to sound under the following:\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         Displace one note and there would be \n                         diminishment. Displace one phrase, \n                         and the structure would fall. It was \n                         clear to me. That sound I had heard \n                         in the Archbishop's palace had been \n                         no accident. Here again was the very \n                         voice of God! I was staring through \n                         the cage of those meticulous ink-\n                         strokes at an absolute, inimitable \n                         beauty.\n\n               The music swells. What we now hear is an amazing collage of \n               great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and \n               to us. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits \n               happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks \n               around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping \n               them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his \n               agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough \n               and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and \n               great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, \n               scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles \n               the room.\n\n               Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in \n               C Minor. It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable \n               to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut. \n               Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head. \n               He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, \n               perplexed.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Is it no good?\n\n               A pause.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         It is miraculous.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Oh yes.

SALON IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               Constanze is sitting on an upright chair, veiled as before, \n               the portfolio of music on her lap. Through the far door \n               leading from the hall, another servant is peering at her.  \n               The first servant joins him and shuts the door on the girl, \n               leaving her alone.\n\n               We stay with her. The clock ticks on the mantelpiece. We \n               hear an old carriage pass in the street below. Nervously she \n               lifts her veil and looks about her.\n\n               Suddenly Salieri appears from the music room. He is pale and \n               very tight. They regard each other. She smiles and rises to \n               greet him, affecting a relaxed and warm manner, as if to put \n               him at his ease.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Well, I'm here.

Oh, excuse me. Let's \n                         not talk about him. What do you think \n                         of this? It's real lace.

Oh, \n                         excuse me! There I go again.\n\n               She picks up the portfolio.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Do you still want to look at this? \n                         Or don't we need to bother anymore?  \n                         I imagine we don't, really.\n\n               She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the \n               floor; pages of music pour out of it. Instantly we hear a \n               massive chord, and the great Qui Tollis from the Mass in C \n               Minor fills the room. To its grand and weighty sound, \n               Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri.  \n               Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting \n               and baffling him. He opens his mouth in distress. The music \n               pounds in his head. The candle flickers over her as she \n               removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. Suddenly \n               he cries out.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Go! Go!

He's a total mediocrity.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         No, no, no: he has yet to achieve \n                         mediocrity.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         But I can't lose this post, I simply \n                         can't! Excellency, please. Let's go \n                         to the palace, and you can explain \n                         to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is \n                         an awful choice.

Salieri offers him a glass of \n               white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes \n               on talking.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Look, I must have pupils.

I hear they are \n                         quite successful.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         They're stupendously successful.  \n                         You can't get a seat. The only problem \n                         is none will hire me. They all want \n                         to hear me play, but they won't let \n                         me teach their daughters. As if I \n                         was some kind of fiend.

The hall is full of dogs, at \n               least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a \n               terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed \n               hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a \n               prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG.

Husband and wife smile \n               encouragingly at each other.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Come on, then. Up and at it!\n\n               Mozart gestures to the music bench. Reluctantly, the girl \n               sits at the instrument. Mozart sits beside her.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Now, please play me something. Just \n                         to give me an idea. Anything will \n                         do.\n\n                                     GERTRUDE\n                              (to parents)\n                         I don't want you to stay.\n\n                                     FRAU SCHLUMBERG\n                         That's all right, dear. Just go ahead, \n                         as if we weren't here.\n\n                                     GERTRUDE\n                         But you are here.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Never mind, Strudel. It's part of \n                         music, getting used to an audience. \n                         Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.\n                              (to Gertrude)\n                         How long have you been playing, \n                         Fraulein?\n\n                                     FRAU SCHLUMBERG\n                         Just one year.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Who was your teacher?\n\n                                     FRAU SCHLUMBERG\n                         I was. But she quite outgrew the \n                         little I could show her.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Thank you, Madame.\n                              (to Gertrude)\n                         Come on now - courage. Play me \n                         something you know.\n\n               In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard \n               without playing a note. An awkward pause.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Perhaps it would be better if we \n                         were left alone. I think we're both \n                         a little shy.\n\n               Husband and wife look at each other.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Nonsense. Strudel's not shy. She's \n                         just willful! You give into her now, \n                         you'll be sorry later. Strudel - \n                         play.\n\n               Silence. The girl sits unmoving. Schlumberg bellows:\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         I said play!\n\n                                     FRAU SCHLUMBERG\n                         Michael!\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Perhaps if I were to play a little \n                         first, it might encourage the \n                         Fraulein.\n                              (to the girl)\n                         Why don't you let me try the \n                         instrument? All right?\n\n               Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They \n               smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises \n               his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls \n               loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet \n               and goes over to the beagle.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at \n                         once!\n                              (to Mozart)\n                         Don't let him disturb you. He'll be \n                         all right. He's just a little willful \n                         too. Please, please - play. I beg \n                         you.\n\n               Mozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece, \n               perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls \n               immediately.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Stop it! STOP!\n\n               Mozart stops.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         No, not you. I was talking to the \n                         dog. You keep playing. It's most \n                         important. He always howls when he \n                         hears music. We've got to break them \n                         of the habit. Play, please. Please!\n\n               Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls \n               louder.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         That's it. Now keep going, just keep \n                         going.\n                              (to the beagle)\n                         Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, \n                         you stop it this instant! This \n                         instant, do you hear me? Keep going, \n                         Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go \n                         on!\n\n               Mozart plays on. Suddenly the dog falls silent. Schlumberg \n               smiles broadly.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Good, good, good! Very good dog! \n                         Very, very good Dudelsachs.\n                              (to his wife, snapping \n                              his fingers)\n                         Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.\n\n               The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. A servant brings \n               in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. He \n               puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent \n               dog with deepest affection.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Now guess who's going to get a nice \n                         reward? Clever, clever Dudi.\n\n               He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily.  \n               Mozart stops playing and stands up.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!\n\n                                     MOZART\n                              (barely controlling \n                              himself)\n                         Well, I'm a good teacher. The next \n                         time you wish me to instruct another \n                         of your dogs, please let me know.  \n                         Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! \n                         goodbye, Sir!\n\n               He bows to them and leaves the room. They look after him in \n               puzzled astonishment.\n\n                                     FRAU SCHLUMBERG\n                         What a strange young man.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Yes. He is a little strange.\n\n               EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               A cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making \n               his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, \n               sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.  \n               Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best \n               expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on \n               the forte-piano.\n\n               Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY -  DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Suddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening \n               chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march \n               from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a \n               menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, \n               standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the \n               figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its \n               arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.  \n               It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held \n               before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music \n               continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes \n               joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's \n               arms.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Papa! PAPA!\n\n               Both men embrace. The music slowly fades.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied \n               for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many \n               empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a \n               mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white \n               keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.\n\n               Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an \n               aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His \n               face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Why are you here?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Am I not welcome?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Of course, welcome! Welcome ten \n                         thousand times. Papa! my Papa!\n\n               He kisses his hands.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You're very thin. Does she not feed \n                         you, this wife of yours?\n\n               Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the \n               landing.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Feed? Well, of course she feeds me. \n                         She stuffs me like a goose all day \n                         long. She's the best cook in the \n                         world. I mean, since Mama. Just wait, \n                         you'll see.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Is she not here?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!\n\n               Leopold looks about him at the mess in the room.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Do you always live like this?\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly \n                         like this. I mean today - just today, \n                         Stanzi - I remember now. She had to \n                         go - yes! She had to help her mother. \n                         Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a \n                         very sweet woman, you'll see.\n\n               He carries the bag across the room and opens the door of the \n               bedroom. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh! I didn't know you were home.  \n                         Stanzi, this is my father.\n\n               Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold.  \n               Leopold stares back from the doorway.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         We'll wait, we'll wait. Why don't \n                         you get up now, darling?\n\n               He closes the door again.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         She's very tired, poor creature.  \n                         You know me: I'm a real pig.

This is an alternate song \n               from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and \n               orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. The vocal part \n               should be arranged for trumpet.\n\n               EXT. STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               Mozart and Constanze with Leopold between them. We see couples \n               shopping.\n\n               INT. A COSTUME SHOP - VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S\n\n               This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.  \n               It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.  \n               Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his \n               forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask. \n\n               Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to \n               put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to \n               which is attached a full mask of dark grey. Its mouth is cut \n               into a fixed upward smile.\n\n               He turns and looks at his son through this mask.\n\n                                                           CUT STRAIGHT TO:\n\n               INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball. Couples are \n               dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes. The music of \n               Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and \n               persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade \n               above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the \n               bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus:  \n               this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves \n               in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses \n               and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as \n               Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak \n               and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across \n               the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go, \n               they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, \n               wearing ordinary evening clothes. He turns away hastily to \n               avoid being seen by them.\n\n               As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes \n               quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino \n               masks off a tray. He quickly takes a small black mask and \n               puts it on.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.  \n               A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder:  \n               the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to \n               another tune.  This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which\n\n               Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The \n               music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has \n               begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing \n               in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music \n               stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who \n               fails must pay a forfeit.\n\n               Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with \n               one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing \n               with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - \n               a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a \n               circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is \n               Salieri.\n\n               Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble \n               for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, \n               bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of \n               it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over-\n               balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze \n               immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and \n               tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But \n               Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         No, no! You both lost. You both lost. \n                         You both have to forfeit. And the \n                         penalty is you must exchange your \n                         wigs.\n\n               People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children \n               jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses \n               immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask \n               and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes \n               off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls. \n               Constanze laughingly surrenders it.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         No, please! This is ridiculous! No, \n                         please!\n\n               Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which \n               the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face \n               showing a very different expression underneath. Another \n               actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on \n               the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig \n               from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         No, really!\n\n                                     MOZART\n                              (calling to him)\n                         This is just a game, Papa.\n\n               Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         This is just a game, Papa!\n\n               Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the \n               children.\n\n                                     BYSTANDERS\n                         This is just a game, Papa!\n\n               As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds \n               in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody \n               bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's \n               wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a \n               weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he \n               looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.  \n               Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to \n               dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves \n               the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing \n               this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father \n               entreatingly by the arm.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the \n                         fun. Come on. Here, take mine.\n\n               He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered \n               head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat \n               bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He \n               takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the \n               music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto \n               a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; \n               and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder \n               calls out to Leopold from the keyboard.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Herr Mozart, why don't you name your \n                         son's penalty?\n\n               Applause.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Yes, Papa, name it.

I've got the \n                         perfect one for you. Come over here.\n\n               Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder \n               surrenders his place at it.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Now, I want you to play our tune - \n                         sitting backwards.\n\n               Applause.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh, that's really too easy.

Mozart smiles \n               at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He \n               defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his \n               back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the \n               company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. \n               His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, \n               and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant \n               fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been \n               dancing.\n\n               Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer \n               to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of \n               the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold \n               sits by himself, sulking.\n\n               The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out \n               to Mozart.\n\n                                     GUESTS\n                         Another! Do another!

Then, \n               watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.\n\n               He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his \n               eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, \n               in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a \n               totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and \n               dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence \n               of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts \n               to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri \n               stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks \n               challengingly back at him.\n\n               Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a \n               fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this \n               up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly \n               he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands \n               up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his \n               breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl \n               of laughter.\n\n               CU, Salieri staring in pain.\n\n               INT.

Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily \n               hearing the music and playing shots on the table.\n\n               From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript \n               paper and jots down notes.

Saremo cosi from Act IV \n               of Figaro resumes, coming to his aid and rising to greet the \n               listener with its serene harmonies. Relieved, Mozart languidly \n               picks up his cue and plays a shot on the billiard table: he \n               is sucked back into his own world of sound.\n\n               INT. SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               The music fades. We see Lorl, dressed in a walking cloak, \n               sitting before a desk, talking to someone confidentially.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         They're out every night, sir.

He never \n                         leaves the house until evening. He \n                         just sits there, writing and writing.  \n                         He doesn't even eat.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Really?

He hands her a pile of coins.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         Oh, thank you, sir!\n\n               She accepts them, delighted.\n\n               EXT. MOZART'S HOUSE - VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               The final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K. \n               482) begins. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts \n               open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried \n               out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street.  \n               Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and \n               Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into \n               a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. \n               As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering \n               slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she \n               shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               An outdoor concert is being given. Mozart is actually playing \n               the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. \n               Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, \n               flanked by Strack and Von Swieten.\n\n               The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a \n               delightful open-air scene. We hear the gayest and most complex \n               passage. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays \n               his own work brilliantly. We stay with this scene for a little \n               while and then\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. VIENNA STREET - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               A carriage clopping through the streets. Lorl is sitting up \n               on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, we glimpse \n               the figure of Salieri.\n\n               EXT. AN ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - 1780'S\n\n               We hear more of the concerto. Perhaps the slow interlude in \n               the last movement of K. 482. Mozart is conducting and playing \n               in a reflective mood. Abruptly we\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. MOZART' S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               Lorl is opening the door admitting Salieri. They go in. The \n               door shuts.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               The room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's \n               ministrations. Salieri stands looking about him with \n               tremendous curiosity.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         I think I've found out about the \n                         money, sir.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Yes what?\n\n               She opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold \n               snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with \n               as a child in the Vatican.\n\n                                     LORL\n                         He kept seven snuff boxes in here.  \n                         I could swear they were all gold. \n                         And now look there's only one left. \n                         And inside, sir, look - I counted \n                         them - tickets from the pawnshop. \n                         Six of them.\n\n               Salieri turns to look around him.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Where does he work?\n\n                                     LORL\n                         In there, sir.\n\n               She points across the room to the workroom. Salieri crosses \n               and goes in alone.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus. He is \n               immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' \n               picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a \n               discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important \n               to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, \n               he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches \n               the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its \n               half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were \n               the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls \n               on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them \n               up.\n\n               CU, The pages.\n\n               We see words set to music. Against each line of notes is the \n               name of a character: Contessa, Susanna, Cherubino. Then \n               another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand.\n\n               Le Nozze di Figaro Comedia per musica tratta dal Francese in \n               quattro atti.\n\n               CU, The word Figaro.\n\n               CU, Salieri.

ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - VIENNA - AFTERNOON - 1780'S\n\n               Mozart is playing the cadenza and coda of Piano Concerto (K. \n               482). He completes the work with a flourish. There is loud \n               applause. The Emperor rises and all follow suit. Mozart comes \n               down to be greeted by him.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, \n                         indeed.

The singers \n               try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their \n               conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks \n               lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. \n               Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart \n               glances back at the group seated in the theatre.  Finally, \n               the Emperor speaks, in a whisper.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         What is this?

The musicians all wear \n               imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume.  \n               Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur.

The restored third act was bold \n                         and brilliant.

I heard the \n                         music of true forgiveness filling \n                         the theatre, conferring on all who \n                         sat there a perfect absolution.

Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are \n               asleep and many mare are apathetic. In the near silence we \n               see the Emperor yawn behind his hand.

Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian \n               costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is \n               Salieri. We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, \n               Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding. We hear great cries \n               of 'Salieri!

The decor and costumes are mythological \n               Persian.

He passes an open bottle of wine to \n               them. He is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face.\n\n               The act comes to an end. Great applause in which Mozart joins \n               in, standing and shouting 'Bravo! Bravo!' Then he leaves the \n               box with Schikaneder and the girls.\n\n               INT.

STAGE OF THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               A crowd of people rings Salieri at a respectful distance.  \n               The Emperor is holding out the Civilian Medal and Chain.\n\n                                     JOSEPH\n                         I believe that is the best opera yet \n                         written, my friends. Salieri, you \n                         are the brightest star in the musical \n                         firmament. You do honour to Vienna \n                         and to me.\n\n               Salieri bows his head. Joseph places the chain around his \n               neck. The crowd claps. Salieri makes to kiss his hand, but \n               Joseph restrains him, and passes on. Cavalieri, smiling \n               adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up.\n\n               The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of \n               approval. All want to shake his hand. They tug and pat him.  \n               But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, \n               searching for him and then finds him. Mozart stands there. \n               Eagerly Salieri moves to him.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Mozart.

MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               Explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter the \n               apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by \n               the three actresses. The front door opens, very gingerly.  \n               Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, \n               anxious not to make a noise. He sees the strangers and breaks \n               into a smile.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Oh. Everybody's here!

Mozart stares.\n\n               INT. AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               The second chord sounds. On stage we see the huge figure of \n               the Commendatore in robes and helmet, extending his arms and \n               pointing in accusation.\n\n               INT. AN OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               The second chord sounds.\n\n               On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of \n               a painted dining room set. The giant armoured statue of the \n               COMMENDATORE enters pointing his finger in accusation at Don \n               Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant \n               Leporello quaking with fear under the table.\n\n                                     THE COMMENDATORE\n                              (singing)\n                         Don Giovanni!\n\n               The figure advances on the libertine. We see Mozart \n               conducting, pale and deeply involved. Music fades down a \n               little.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         So rose the dreadful ghost in his \n                         next and blackest opera. There on \n                         the stage stood the figure of a dead \n                         commander calling out 'Repent! \n                         Repent!'\n\n               The music swells. We see Salieri standing alone in the back \n               of a box, unseen, in semi-darkness. We also see that the \n               theatre is only half full. Music fades down.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)\n                         And I knew - only I understood - \n                         that the horrifying apparition was \n                         Leopold, raised from the dead. \n                         Wolfgang had actually summoned up \n                         his own father to accuse his son \n                         before all the world. It was \n                         terrifying and wonderful to watch.\n\n               Music swells up again. We watch the scene on stage as the \n               Commendatore addresses Giovanni. Then back to Salieri in the \n               box. Music down again.\n\n               INT.

The madness \n                         of a man splitting in half. Through \n                         my influence I saw to it Don Giovanni \n                         was played only five times in Vienna.  \n                         But in secret I went to every one of \n                         those five - all alone - unable to \n                         help myself, worshipping sound I \n                         alone seemed to hear.\n\n               INT.

On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by \n               the Statue's icy hand. Flames burst from obviously artificial \n               rocks. Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell.  \n               The scene ends.\n\n               CU, Salieri, staring wide-eyed.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1780'S\n\n               Noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening \n               of vaudeville. Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now \n               about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are \n               watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe. They are \n               rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and \n               tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. \n               Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates \n               of sausages, etc.\n\n               THE PARODY\n\n               On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don \n               Giovanni's palace, shown before.\n\n               Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three \n               actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), \n               played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. Leporello is handing \n               around wine on a tray.\n\n               Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. The \n               music slithers to a stop. All look at each other in panic. \n               Leporello drops his tray with a crash. All go quiet. One \n               more knock is heard. Then all musicians, actresses, Don \n               Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table \n               which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table \n               rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes \n               elaborately. Three more knocks are heard; louder.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Who is it?\n\n               One more knock.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         C-c-c-come in!\n\n               In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni \n               turns into a anticipatory vamp. This grows more and more \n               menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the \n               back falls down.\n\n               An absurd pantomime horse gallops in. It has a ridiculous \n               expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing \n               precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature \n               version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore.  \n               He sings in a high, nasal voice:\n\n                                     COMMENDATORE\n                              (singing)\n                         Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!\n\n               He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. He \n               falls off onto the stage. He beats at the horse, trying to \n               get back on.\n\n                                     COMMENDATORE\n                         Down! Down!\n\n               Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his \n               small rider who is below his level of sight.\n\n                                     COMMENDATORE\n                         I'm here! I'm here!\n\n               The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate \n               him. Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings.  \n               A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders \n               stands another man.\n\n               The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw. There is \n               a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end \n               and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the \n               horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don \n               Giovanni. The two men bow to the applauding audience, and \n               retire off-stage.\n\n               The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper \n               menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face \n               Don Giovanni.

The soprano collapses on the bar of the \n               trapeze. The audience applauds. At the same moment eight \n               dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water. \n               They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was \n               cut from Act III of Figaro. They are dressed as miniature \n               copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are \n               wearing cooks' hats.\n\n                                     EIGHT DWARVES\n                              (singing)\n                         We're going to make a soprano stew! \n                         We're going to make a soprano stew! \n                         And when you make a soprano stew! \n                         Any stupid soprano will do!

The \n               trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the \n               stage.\n\n               We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture \n               again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando. \n               To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a \n               real horse, waving a real sword. With this he cuts the string \n               of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot. A \n               tremendous splash of water. Schikaneder rides out. More \n               applause.\n\n               All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb \n               up the sides of the pot.

Leporello - where are \n                         you?\n\n               The table is raised in the air by Leporello sitting under it \n               on a bale of hay.\n\n                                     FIRST LADY\n                              (singing to horse)\n                         Behold!\n\n                                     SECOND LADY\n                              (singing to horse)\n                         Behold!\n\n                                     THIRD LADY\n                              (singing to horse)\n                         Behold!\n\n               Ottavio the horse gives a piercing neigh and runs down to \n               the hay.\n\n                                     COMMENDATORE\n                              (holding on)\n                         Hey! Hey! Watch out!\n\n               The vamp starts again vigorously. The horse's rear-end swings \n               around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to \n               the audience. The rest of him stays sideways. His tail springs \n               up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding \n               his arsehole.\n\n               Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay. The horse eats it, \n               and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage. The \n               audience roars with laughter. Another handful of hay and out \n               of the other end falls a string of sausages. Then a large \n               pie, crust and all. Then a shower of iced cakes! \n\n               Suddenly - silence. Schikaneder produces an egg from his \n               pocket. Ottavio the horse rears up in disgust.\n\n                                     COMMENDATORE\n                         Whoa! Whoa, Ottavio! Whoa!\n\n               Leporello pries open the horse's mouth. Schikaneder pops the \n               egg into it. A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the \n               tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the \n               horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.\n\n               Wild applause.\n\n               It flies into the audience. Immediately all the cast start \n               humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti.  \n               More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the \n               theatre. Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins \n               to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and \n               magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse \n               strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole \n               company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the \n               curtain falls.\n\n               It rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is \n               delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow \n               amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he \n               finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience \n               toward the table where Mozart sits with his family. On stage, \n               a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old \n               German tune. Some of the audience joins in singing it.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Well, how do you like that?\n\n               Mozart is smiling; he has been amused. Constanze has been \n               less amused and is looking apprehensive.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Wonderful!\n                              (indicating his baby \n                              son)\n                         He liked the monkey, didn't you?\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Yes, well, it's all good fun.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         I liked the horse.\n\n               Schikaneder sits at the table, and drinks from a bottle of \n               wine.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         Isn't he marvelous? He cost me a \n                         bundle, that horse, but he's worth \n                         it. I tell you, if you'd played Don \n                         Giovanni here it would have been a \n                         great success. I'm not joking. These \n                         people aren't fools. You could do \n                         something marvelous for them.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         I'd like to try them someday. I'm \n                         not sure I'd be much good at it.\n\n                                     SCHIKANEDER\n                         'Course you would.

SCHLUMBERG HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 1780'S\n\n               Dogs are barking wickedly. Michael Schlumberg comes in from \n               his salon. Mozart stands there looking very unwell and \n               bewildered. He is also drunk, but making a careful attempt \n               to keep his composure.\n\n                                     SCHLUMBERG\n                         Herr Mozart. What a surprise.

THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY - DAY - 1790'S\n\n               Von Swieten and Salieri stand close together. Several scholars \n               and students are examining scrolls and manuscripts at the \n               other end of the room.\n\n                                     VON SWIETEN\n                              (keeping his voice \n                              down)\n                         This is embarrassing, you know. You \n                         introduced Mozart to some of my \n                         friends and he's begging from \n                         practically all of them. It has to \n                         stop.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         I agree, Baron.\n\n                                     VON SWIETEN\n                         Can't you think of anyone who might \n                         commission some work from him? I've \n                         done my best. I got him to arrange \n                         some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He \n                         got a fee - what I could afford. \n                         Can't you think of anyone who might \n                         do something for him?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is \n                         a lost cause. He has managed to \n                         alienate practically the whole of \n                         Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He \n                         never pays his debts. I can't think \n                         of one person to whom I dare recommend \n                         him.\n\n                                     VON SWIETEN\n                         How sad.

A very appropriate person to do \n                         so. Yes.\n\n               The opening measures of the Piano Concerto in D Minor steal \n               in.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Now Salieri's servant stands in it, \n               waiting. We see a few other customers being served by the \n               staff: renting masks, costumes, etc. One of the staff emerges \n               from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he \n               hands to Salieri's servant. The servant leaves the shop.  \n               Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy \n               street full of passers-by, carriages, etc.\n\n               INT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DUSK - 1790'S\n\n               The D Minor Concerto continues. Salieri, alone, eagerly opens \n               the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark \n               cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now \n               attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a \n               frown, not a laugh. It presents a bitter and menacing \n               expression. He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and \n               turns his back. Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming \n               image reflected in a full-length mirror. The music swells \n               darkly.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

Some of them wear \n               frivolous carnival clothes.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK - 1790'S\n\n               Mozart sits writing at a table. He appears now to be really \n               quite sick. His face expresses pain from his stomach cramps.  \n               There is a gentle knock at the door. He rises, goes to he \n               door and opens it. Immediately there is a SHOCK CUT:\n\n               The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us. The violent \n               D Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard. Salieri in \n               costume stands in the doorway.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Herr Mozart?\n\n               The second chord sounds and fades.

Instantly we \n               hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in D Minor).  \n               Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on \n               the wall. The portrait stares back. Constanze opens the door \n               from the bedroom. She sees him staring up.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Wolfi?

First I must get the Death Mass \n                         and then achieve the death.\n\n               Vogler stares at him in horror.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         What?\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         His funeral - imagine it! The \n                         Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. \n                         His coffin, Mozart's little coffin \n                         in the middle. And suddenly in that \n                         silence, music. A divine music bursts \n                         out over them all, a great Mass of \n                         Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang \n                         Mozart, composed by his devoted friend \n                         Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! \n                         What depth! What passion in the music! \n                         Salieri has been touched by God at \n                         last. And God, forced to listen.  \n                         Powerless - powerless to stop it. I \n                         at the end, for once, laughing at \n                         Him.

How does one do \n                         that? How does one kill a man? It's \n                         one thing to dream about it. It's \n                         very different when you have to do \n                         it, with your own hands.\n\n               He raises his own hands and stares at them.

MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               Mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music. His \n               whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever. He \n               pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it \n               hits his stomach. All around him are manuscripts.\n\n               There is a banging at the front door. Mozart does not hear \n               it; the music raves on. Another knocking comes, louder. \n               Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her \n               distracted husband. The knocking is repeated again, even \n               more violently and insistently.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Wolfi.

Come back later.\n\n               He runs out of he room, into his workroom, and shuts he door.  \n               Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door \n               and opens it cautiously. Schikaneder stands there, floridly \n               dressed as usual.

MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty. The camera \n               shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down \n               upon a scene of disorder.\n\n               Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the \n               fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, \n               woven with symbols. To the more lyrical passage of the \n               introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:\n\n               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart \n               now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Tenderly he \n               touches her hair. Then he moves to the cot where his son \n               Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little \n               blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the \n               boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart \n               rises and returns to:\n\n               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue \n               begins. Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: \n               gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait, \n               and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an \n               irresponsible and happy boy again.\n\n               Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The \n               music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door. \n               The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the \n               happy music. It ends. Before him stands the masked stranger.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         I don't have it yet. It's not \n                         finished.

Constanze has come into the living room.  \n               Nervously, Mozart indicates her.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         This is my wife, Stanzi.

He looks up and sees that \n               Constanze is fast asleep in her chair. Mozart gets up quietly.  \n               He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and \n               tiptoes from the house. Without stopping, the music changes \n               from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the \n               Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SCHIKANEDER'S SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the \n               tenement by the Weiden. Inside, we see a table, chairs, a \n               forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. Strewn about in \n               the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. Schikaneder \n               and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird-\n               people. The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a \n               soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard. Absurdly, \n               they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.\n\n               EXT. VIENNA STREET - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               Mozart, drunk and happy, staggers back through the snow.  \n               There are a few people about. He goes into his apartment \n               building.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1790'S\n\n               He comes through he door and stares across the living room \n               at an open bedroom door. Puzzled, he crosses.\n\n               The bedroom is also empty. We see Constanze's empty bed; \n               Karl's empty bed; empty closets.\n\n                                     MOZART\n                         Stanzi? Stanzi-marini-bini?\n\n               He looks about him, puzzled.\n\n               INT. FRAU WEBER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1790'S\n\n               Frau Weber sits grimly talking. Mozart sits also, completely \n               exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech.\n\n                                     FRAU WEBER\n                         She's not coming back, you know. \n                         She's gone for good. I did it and \n                         I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said. \n                         'Right away! Take he child and go, \n                         just go. Here's the money! Go to the \n                         Spa and get your health back - that's \n                         if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked \n                         to my foundation. Is that my girl?  \n                         Can that be my Stanzi? The happy \n                         little moppet I brought up, that \n                         poor trembling thing? Oh, you monster!  \n                         No one exists but you, do they? You \n                         and your music! Do you know how often \n                         she's sat in that very chair, weeping \n                         her eyes out of her head because of \n                         you? I warned her. 'Choose a man, \n                         not a baby,' I said. But would she \n                         listen? Who listens? 'He's just a \n                         silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse.  \n                         Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish! \n                         Selfish, selfish, selfish, selfish, \n                         selfish.\n\n               And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill \n               packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of \n               the Night, in The Magic Flute.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, \n               furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, \n               we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from \n               when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of \n               ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits:  \n               they are rapt and excited.\n\n               The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed \n               curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private \n               intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri.\n\n                                     QUEEN OF THE NIGHT\n                              (singing furiously)\n                         A hellish wrath within my heart is \n                         seething!

If not by thee \n                         Sarastro's light be extinguished. \n                         Then be thou mine own daughter never \n                         more! Rejected be forever!

She disappears amidst tremendous \n               applause from the audience.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

STAGE, AUDITORIUM AND WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - \n               NIGHT -1790'S\n\n               We CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein \n               Madchen oder Weibchen. Papageno, played by Schikaneder, \n               dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through \n               a mysterious door. A voice calls from within.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Go back!\n\n               Papageno recoils.\n\n                                     PAPAGENO\n                         Merciful Gods!

Oh, this is awful!\n\n               He weeps extravagantly.\n\n               In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take \n               over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily \n               backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno \n               being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.\n\n                                     FIRST PRIEST\n                              (on stage)\n                         Man, thou hast deserved to wander \n                         forever in the darkest chasms of the \n                         earth. The gentle Gods have remitted \n                         thy punishment, but yet thou shalt \n                         never feel the Divine Content of the \n                         consecrated ones.\n\n                                     PAPAGENO\n                         Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just \n                         give me a decent glass of wine - \n                         that's divine content enough for me.\n\n               Laughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.\n\n               We follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand \n               around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and \n               parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of \n               a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. \n               Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel \n               with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. \n               Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the \n               instrument himself.\n\n               On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the \n               First Priest.\n\n                                     FIRST PRIEST\n                         Man, hast thou no other desire on \n                         earth, but just to eat and drink?\n\n                                     PAPAGENO\n                              (Schikaneder)\n                         Well!\n\n               Laughter from the audience.\n\n                                     PAPAGENO\n                         Well, actually I do have a rather \n                         weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps \n                         it's just indigestion. But you know, \n                         I really would like - I really do \n                         want - something even nicer than \n                         food and drink. Now what on earth \n                         could that be?\n\n               He stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh.\n\n               Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It \n               is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, \n               with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by \n               Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart \n               conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation \n               with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches \n               entranced.\n\n                                     ANDANTE\n                         A sweetheart or a pretty little wife \n                         is Papageno's wish.

Up to heaven be flown! Up \n                         to heaven be flown!\n\n               At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of \n               view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then \n               we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes \n               in the wings. Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and \n               no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He \n               looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.  \n               People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a \n               near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to \n               the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At \n               this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered \n               cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a \n               hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly \n               down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.\n\n               A few people around him are trying to revive him. One has \n               put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding \n               a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying, \n               'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage. \n               Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a \n               distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of \n               Salieri.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         I'll take care of him.\n\n               He steps forward.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         I have a carriage. Excuse me.\n\n               The actors step back respectfully. He stoops and picks up \n               the frail composer in his arms. Mozart is quite limp and \n               Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. All this \n               is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing \n               his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman.\n\n                                     UGLY OLD WOMAN\n                         Here I am, my angel.\n\n                                     PAPAGENO\n                              (appalled)\n                         What?

How wonderful.  \n                         Some people get all the luck.\n\n               Audience laughter. The actress raises the little painted \n               cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty \n               young one to the audience. More laughter.\n\n                                     UGLY OLD WOMAN\n                         Now you've got to promise me \n                         faithfully you'll remain true to me \n                         forever.

Mozart has recovered consciousness, \n               but looks exceedingly ill. Salieri has set him down in the \n               winter's night.

Salieri helps him into the sedan. \n               The door is shut. The chair sets off and Salieri strides \n               beside it, through the mean street. A lantern with a candle \n               swings from the chair.\n\n               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               The door opens. Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the \n               sedan chair. He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms \n               of one of the porters. The room is now really in complete \n               disarray. The table is piled high with music: the pages of \n               the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles. The porter \n               carries Mozart into\n\n               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S\n\n               This room is miserably neglected. The bed is unmade, clothes \n               lie about on the floor. A sock has been stuck into the broken \n               pane of one window.\n\n               The porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights \n               candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food \n               and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed. It is \n               obviously very cold. Another very small bed nearby belongs \n               to the child, Karl.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                              (handing the porter \n                              the lantern)\n                         Thank you.

Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed \n               in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is \n               obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped \n               position.\n\n               EXT.

Salieri is dozing on the nearby \n               child's bed. The room is full of the trailing smoke from \n               guttering and guttered candles. Startled by Constanze's \n               entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does \n               so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, \n               so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look \n               absurd.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         What are you doing here?\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         Your husband is ill, ma'am.

If you'll \n                         just try a little harder to be nice \n                         to me. And I'll try to do better, \n                         too. We must. We must! This was just \n                         silly and stupid.\n\n               She hugs her husband desperately. He stares at her with \n               obvious relief, not able to speak. Suddenly she sees the \n               manuscript in his hand.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         What is this?\n\n               She looks at it and recognizes it.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Oh no, not this.

At the same moment Salieri \n               reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on \n               the table.\n\n               She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and \n               frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound. Mozart \n               makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. The coins \n               brought by Salieri fall on the floor.  Karl runs after them, \n               laughing.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                              (to Salieri)\n                         This is not his handwriting.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         No. I was assisting him.

It is making him ill. Please.\n\n               She extends her hand for the Requiem, as she stands up.  \n               Salieri hesitates.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                              (hard)\n                         Please.\n\n               With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it - \n               Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Thank you.\n\n               She marches with the manuscript over to a large chest in the \n               room, opens it, throws the manuscript inside, shuts the lid, \n               locks it and pockets the key. Involuntarily Salieri stretches \n               out his arms for the lost manuscript.\n\n                                     SALIERI\n                         But - but - but -\n\n               She turns and faces him.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Good night.\n\n               He stares at her, stunned.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         I regret we have no servants to show \n                         you out, Herr Salieri.

He asked \n                         me to stay here.\n\n               They look at each other in mutual hatred. She turns to the \n               bed. Mozart appears to have gone to sleep again.\n\n                                     CONSTANZE\n                         Wolfi?\n                              (louder)\n                         Wolfi?\n\n               She moves to the bed. The child is playing with the coins on \n               the floor. Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from \n               the Requiem. Salieri watches as she touches her husband's \n               hand. As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead.\n\n               CU, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension.\n\n               CU, Salieri also comprehending hat he has been cheated.\n\n               The music rises.\n\n               CU, The child on the floor, playing with the money.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. STEPHEN'S CATHEDRAL - VIENNA - A RAINY DAY - 1790'S\n\n               The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small \n               group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet \n               day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin. The coffin is borne \n               by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes. They \n               load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse. All the \n               rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and \n               her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie, \n               and even Lorl, the maid. It is drizzling. The cart sets off. \n               The group follows.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS OF VIENNA - RAINY DAY - 1790'S\n\n               The group has already passed beyond the city limits following \n               the miserable cart. The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its \n               measured thread.\n\n               The drizzle of rain has now become heavy. One by one, the \n               group breaks up and shelters under the trees. The cart moves \n               on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing \n               more and more distant. They watch it go.\n\n               Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water \n               soaking their black tall hats. Schikaneder is in tears. \n               Constanze is near collapse. Salieri moves to assist her, but \n               she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri. Madame \n               Weber takes Karl's hand.\n\n               The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem! We CUT \n               back to:\n\n               INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING - 1823\n\n               Morning light fills the room. Old Salieri sits weeping \n               convulsively, as the music stops. Tears stream down his face. \n               Vogler watches him, amazed.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery \n                         by confessing to murder? You didn't \n                         kill him.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         I did.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         No, you didn't!\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         I poisoned his life.\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         But not his body.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         What difference does that make?\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         My son, why should you want all Vienna \n                         to believe you a murderer? Is that \n                         your penance? Is it?\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         No, Father. From now on no one will \n                         be able to speak of Mozart without \n                         thinking of me. Whenever they say \n                         Mozart with love, they'll have to \n                         say Salieri with loathing. And that's \n                         my immortality - at last! Our names \n                         will  be tied together for eternity - \n                         his in fame and mine in infamy. At \n                         least it's better than the total \n                         oblivion he'd planned for me, your \n                         merciful God!\n\n                                     VOGLER\n                         Oh my son, my poor son!\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You \n                         serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, \n                         not I. Took him, snatched him away, \n                         without pity. He destroyed His beloved \n                         rather than let a mediocrity like me \n                         get the smallest share in his glory.  \n                         He doesn't care. Understand that. \n                         God cares nothing for the man He \n                         denies and nothing either for the \n                         man He uses. He broke Mozart in half \n                         when He'd finished with him, and \n                         threw him away. Like an old, worn \n                         out flute.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY OF ST. MARX - LATE AFTERNOON - 1790'S\n\n               The rain has eased off. A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes \n               is standing beside an open communal grave. Mozart's body is \n               lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.\n\n               We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. The \n               gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the \n               others. An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of \n               them. The acolytes swing their censers.\n\n                                     LOCAL PRIEST\n                         The Lord giveth. The Lord taketh \n                         away.

I had no value. What was the \n                         use, keeping me alive for thirty-two \n                         years of torture? Thirty-two years \n                         of honours and awards.\n\n               He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the \n               Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and \n               throws it across the room.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Being bowed to and saluted, called \n                         'distinguished - distinguished \n                         Salieri' - by men incapable of \n                         distinguishing! Thirty-two years of \n                         meaningless fame to end up alone in \n                         my room, watching myself become \n                         extinct. My music growing fainter, \n                         all the time fainter, until no one \n                         plays it at all. And his growing \n                         louder, filling the world with wonder. \n                         And everyone who loves my sacred art \n                         crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.\n\n               The door opens. An attendant comes in, cheerful and hearty.\n\n                                     ATTENDANT\n                         Good morning, Professor!

CORRIDOR OF THE HOSPITAL - MORNING\n\n               The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, \n               all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses \n               and nuns. They form a long, wretched, strange procession - \n               some of them are clearly very disturbed. As Old Salieri is \n               pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to \n               them in benediction.\n\n                                     OLD SALIERI\n                         Mediocrities everywhere, now and to \n                         come: I absolve you all!
