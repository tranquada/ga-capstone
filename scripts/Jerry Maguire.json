Underling agent BOB\n              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.\n              (\"Finally, someone said it!\") Suddenly another agent begins\n              to clap, then reluctantly, another.

There is The One He Was Too\n              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For (\"He hated being\n              alone.\") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock\n              girlfriend (\"Sports makes me ill\"), The Now Married With Kids\n              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend (\"Beneath the cute\n              exterior, more cute exterior.\") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,\n              The Brainy Girlfriend, (\"Great at friendship, bad at\n              intimacy\") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry\n              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-\n              way-to-the-airport).

Jerry always has a\n              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up\n              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his\n              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation\n              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark.

From across the fence, a stray baseball from a\n              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of\n              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it\n              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few\n              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of\n              a great little throw.\n\n\n<b>                                                                     132.\n</b><b> \n</b><b> \n</b>              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown\n              shocking natural ability.

And then, not ready to\n              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they\n              say quickly to the boy:\n<b> \n</b><b>                           JERRY                         DOROTHY\n</b>                   Come on, Ray.
