He walks briskly and smoothly, yellow legal\n              tablet in hand, at home in this lobby filled with Athletes\n              and Sports Team Owners.

They sit in a\n              carefully appointed conference room.\n \n              Sports photos and posters are framed on the walls.  The signs\n              of global marketing are omnipresent.

UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE -- HOUSTON -- DAY\n \n              An unmarked car pulls into the underground parking facility\n              of the Houston Police Department.  A cluster of chattering\n              media members move in on the car. (\"Baja!!\"  \"Baja, over\n              here!!\")  Back doors open, and out steps Jerry Maguire with\n              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY \"BAJA\" BRUNARD, 22.

Professional smile in place, Maguire\n              attempts spin.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Listen, there's no proof of\n                        anything except that this guy is\n                        a sensational athlete.\n \n              In the background, we hear baja bellowing insults at the\n              press.\n \n              INT. ATLANTA RED CARPET ROOM -- ANOTHER DAY\n \n              Jerry now sits next to a towering white 27 year-old\n              basketball player with a bad haircut. He is CALVIN NACK.\n              They are signing a contract in the airport lounge. A little\n              BOY approaches the player with a basketball trading card.\n \n                                  LITTLE BOY\n                        Are you Calvin Nack?

HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n \n              Remo's 14 year-old SON (JESSE) confronts Jerry outside the\n              hospital room. He's a hulking kid, a Pop Warner football\n              player himself.

His fingers fly.  Even his eyes grow\n              moist.\n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                        What started out as one page\n                        became twenty-five. Suddenly I was\n                        my father's son.  I was\n                        remembering the simple pleasures\n                        of this job, how I ended up here\n                        out of law school, the way a\n                        stadium sounds when one of my\n                        players performs well on the\n                        field... I was remembering even\n                        the words of the late Dicky Fox,\n                        the original sports agent, who\n                        said:\n \n              SHOT OF DICKY FOX\n \n                                  DICKY FOX\n                        The key to this job is personal\n                        relationships.\n \n              As Jerry continues typing, his voice is excited now.\n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                        And suddenly it was all pretty\n                        clear. The answer was fewer\n                        clients.  Caring for them, caring\n                        for ourselves, and the games too.\n                        Starting our lives, really.\n \n              SHOT OF SENTENCE:  We must embrace what is still virginal\n              about our own enthusiasm, we must crack open the tightly\n              clenched fist and give back a little for the common good, we\n              must simply be the best versions of ourselves... that\n              goodness will be unbeatable and the money will appear.\n \n              He pauses, and wipes his eyes, still considering the sentence.\n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                               (continuing)\n                        Hey, I'll be the first to admit\n                        it. What I was writing was\n                        somewhat \"touchy feely.\"\n \n              He deletes it.  And then -- zip -- he restores it and\n              continues on, boldly.\n\n\n                                                                     8.\n \n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                               (continuing)\n                        I didn't care.  I had lost the\n                        ability to bullshit.  It was the\n                        me I'd always wanted to be.\n \n              INT. KINKO'S COPIES -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry in T-shirt stands proudly watching copies pumped out.\n              Wired college students, band guys, other Copy People of the\n              Night nearby.\n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                        I printed it up in the middle of\n                        the night, before I could re-think\n                        it.\n \n              Industrial, multi-pierced Kinko's copy guy examines the first\n              printed copy of the Mission Statement.  He nods approvingly,\n              taps his heart in tribute.  He slides a copy across the\n              counter, for Jerry's approval.\n \n                          THE THINGS WE THINK AND DO NOT SAY\n                            (The Future of Our Business)\n \n                                  KINKO'S GUY\n                        That's how you become great, man.\n                        You hang your ba11s out there.\n \n              Jerry nods.  It's 3 AM, and this guy sounds and looks like a\n              prophet.  In fact, everyone in Kinko's at 3 AM does.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (self-effacing)\n                        Thanks.\n \n              ON MEMOS\n \n              being stuffed into mail-slots.\n \n              INT. HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING\n \n              Jerry splashes water onto his face.  The sun is coming up.\n              He looks younger, lighter.\n \n              ON TV MOVIE  (JERRY WATCHING)\n \n              Suddenly, dramatic movie score.  It's Dana Andrews, showing\n              Gene Tierney the newspaper reports of her death in Laura.\n              (\"Someone was murdered in this room last night... any idea\n              who it was?\")  Camera whips to Jerry, standing watching as he\n              packs.  A slight concern on his face.  He moves to the phone,\n              and dials with urgency.\n\n\n                                                                     9.\n \n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Hi, it's jerry maguire.

ELEVATOR -- DAY\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Jerry in suit, alone with his\n                        luggage.  Dry throat. clammy,\n                        holds onto the handrail to steady\n                        himself.\n \n              INT. LOBBY -- DAY\n \n              The lobby is filled with SMI agents.  The blue Mission\n              Statement is in evidence everywhere.  Jerry inconspicuously\n              turns the corner, yearns to blend in.  It's impossible, the\n              recognition ripples through the lobby.  Underling agent BOB\n              SUGAR, 25, is the first to grab Maguire by the shoulders.\n              (\"Finally, someone said it!\") Suddenly another agent begins\n              to clap, then reluctantly, another. Soon, the ovation rocks\n              the lobby.  (In a three-shot near the front desk, we see a 26\n              year-old female employee of SMI applauding with Mission\n              Statement in hand, her sleepy son at her side.)  Jerry\n              motions for them all to stop, but clearly he could listen\n              forever. It is a watershed moment in his life.\n \n                                  JERRY'S VOICE\n                        I was 35.  I had started my life.\n \n              Swing off Maguire to find two agents standing clapping\n              enthusiastically near the elevator. One offers gum to the\n              other.\n \n                                  AGENT # 1 (RACHEL)\n                        How long you give him?\n \n                                  AGENT # 2 (CHRIS)\n                        Mmmm.

AIRPLANE/FIRST CLASS -- NIGHT\n \n              We move past a snoring businessman, onto tired but\n              adrenalized Jerry Maguire.  He sits in first-class, working\n              on his laptop, a pile of newspapers and magazines nearby.\n              The WOMAN PASSENGER next to him, 3oish, finishes up a spicy\n              phone conversation with her boyfriend.\n\n\n                                                                     10.\n \n \n                                  WOMAN\n                        Monkeyface... monkeyface,\n                        listen...

Battery's\n              low.\n \n                                  WOMAN\n                               (continuing)\n                        ...  oh listen, I got you the\n                        perfect white shirt, at this out\n                        of the way place... no... quit\n                        trying to make me say it!\n \n              Jerry shuts off his laptop and prepares for sleep.  Trying\n              not to listen.\n \n                                  WOMAN\n                               (continuing)\n                        how about if I do it and don't say\n                        it... mmmm... see you soon...\n \n              She laughs seductively and hangs up.  She is still buzzed\n              from the conversation.  Jerry turns to her, surprising her.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        I have to ask.\n \n                                  WOMAN\n                               (protective)\n                        What --\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Where'd you find the perfect white\n                        shirt?\n \n              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers\n              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past\n              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the\n              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.\n \n              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in\n              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-\n              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she\n              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in\n              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her\n              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.\n              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.\n              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like\n              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The\n              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.\n\n\n                                                                     11.\n \n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Look, my son is allergic to the\n                        material in these blankets -\n \n                                  ATTENDANT\n                        That's all we have.\n \n              The Attendant offers a bundle of soggy cocktail napkins and\n              is about to exit as Ray makes a gagging noise.  He's about to\n              get sick. Both women reach for an airsick bag, and get it to\n              his mouth just in time. Their faces are now inches apart.\n \n                                  ATTENDANT\n                               (continuing)\n                        I'm sorry I was rude just then --\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        It's okay.

The effect is funny, but the\n              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too\n              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For (\"He hated being\n              alone.\") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock\n              girlfriend (\"Sports makes me ill\"), The Now Married With Kids\n              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend (\"Beneath the cute\n              exterior, more cute exterior.\") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,\n              The Brainy Girlfriend, (\"Great at friendship, bad at\n              intimacy\") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry\n              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-\n              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points\n              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following\n              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a\n              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up\n              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his\n              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation\n              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends\n              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to\n              burn all these old phone numbers.)\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (wounded good sport)\n                        ... this is... uh... too funny...\n \n                                  DOOLER\n                        They ain't laughing, man.\n                        Something's wrong.\n \n              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is\n              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep\n              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the\n              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut\n              to music.\n \n              INT. SMI OFFICE -- DAY\n \n              Elevator doors open.  Maguire is now paranoid.  He walks\n              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner\n              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners\n              for the Gunman.

Moving forward. There is trouble in the\n              air, but only he seems to sense it.

He lands in reclining mode with a soft pooof.\n              The younger turks watch their new leader.  Victory is his.\n \n              INT. JERRY'S OFFICE -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry stands at the door, holding some belongings.

It's a fire-tailed Peruvian\n              beauty.  He grabs a baggie from an assistant's desk, shakes\n              out some crumbs, and dumps the fish inside.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing; to fish)\n                        it's okay... it's okay...\n \n              Nearby, a Xerox Repair Guy watches the human train wreck.\n\n\n                                                                     38.\n \n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing)\n                        But if anybody else wants to come\n                        with me, this moment will be the\n                        ground floor of something real and\n                        fun and inspiring and true in this\n                        godforsaken business and we will\n                        do it together!  Who's coming with\n                        me besides... \"Flipper\" here?\n \n              But clearly even Flipper is not happy with the new\n              arrangement. Panicked, he whips around the small baggie.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing)\n                        Anybody going with me?\n \n              Silence, someone coughs, as agents and office personnel look\n              on with equal parts pity and embarrassment. Jerry downs\n              another small cup of water. His lid is blowing off with each\n              second.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing)\n                        Wendy?

I have to, uh...\n                        you know, stay.\n \n              Jerry absorbs the blow, and takes the keys from the top of\n              her desk.  She can't look at him.  Jerry stands alone, the\n              blue Mission Statement on Wendy's desk sits accusingly in\n              frame.  There is only silence now, the loudest kind.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Okay, anybody else?\n \n              ON DOROTHY\n \n              She looks around.  Doesn't anybody believe in the very thing\n              they were applauding three days ago?  She has an odd\n              reaction, a muscle twitch of the soul.   Before she knows it,\n              she stands boldly, unfortunately knocking a cup of coffee\n              onto herself in the process.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        I'll go with you.\n                               (quietly, on her\n                                coffee mess)\n                        Wonderful...\n\n\n                                                                     39.\n \n \n              She dabs at her pants.

Sleep\n                        tight!\n \n              He walks to Dorothy, and together they exit down the hallway\n              corridor, past the framed posters and awards.\n \n              WIDE-SHOT\n \n              rising over the huge office.  For the first time, we see the\n              full expanse of the huge SMI headquarters.  And down in the\n              corner of the frame, two small figures leave carrying boxes.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (to Dorothy)\n                        Let's see how they do without us.\n \n              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal\n              commercial roar.  A couple of fleas have been swatted off the\n              carcass of an immense beast.\n \n              INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT\n \n              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.\n              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with\n              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is\n              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple\n              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five\n              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They\n              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the\n              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl\n              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are\n              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their\n              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Wonder what he said.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        My favorite aunt is hearing\n                        impaired. He said \"you complete\n                        me.\"\n\n\n                                                                     40.\n \n \n              They continue on in silence.\n \n              INT. BUILDING LOBBY -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry and Dorothy pass through another office's party.  Loud\n              music. It's a pre-Easter party thrown for the building\n              employees and their children.  Jerry and Dorothy squeeze\n              through with boxes and fish.\n \n              EXT. SMI PARKING LOT -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry and Dorothy walk to their cars.  Music in distance.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        So I know this is a bad time,\n                        but -- you will have a medical\n                        program, right?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.\n \n              He spaces out for a moment.  Awkwardly, she touches him\n              briefly.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        And I guess we didn't talk about\n                        money.

I have no idea.\n\n\n                                                                     52.\n \n \n                                  JERRY\n                        I have no idea.\n                               (continuing to Ray)\n                        So Ray, if there's an accident or\n                        something, it goes pwoooooooof --\n                               (simulates air-bag)\n                        -- and you go booooong.  And\n                        you're safe.\n \n              Jerry bounces against the imaginary balloon.  Ray is\n              delighted by Jerry.   Dorothy notes that he's great with her\n              son.  She pats Jerry on the shoulder.  Her hand lingers\n              perhaps a millisecond too long.  She pulls away quickly,\n              always feeling on the edge or embarrassing herself around\n              this guy.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Okay, have we gone over\n                        everything? Back on Tuesday, right?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Yep.  Have a good time at school,\n                        Ray.  Wish me luck.\n \n                           DOROTHY                       RAY\n                   Luck.                         LUCK!\n \n              Jerry nods and exits.  They watch as Jerry inches into the\n              crowded airport.  Into frame, obscuring their view of Jerry,\n              enters another Couple, who embrace each other and their small\n              girl.   It's a genuinely sweet goodbye, and we linger on\n              Dorothy and Ray who both watch with private fantasies of the\n              goodbye they didn't get. Mother and son look at each other,\n              communicating volumes. They pull back into traffic.\n \n              INT. DALLAS AIRPORT -- DAY\n \n              Jerry struggles through the Dallas airport, is the last, of\n              his party to arrive at the B gate in Dallas.  Avery, tall and\n              cool in plaid skirt and shades, is in combat mode.   Nearby,\n              Cush is surrounded by fans and fawning Airline Employees.\n              (\"Where do you think you're gonna end up, Cush?\"  \"You gonna\n              be rich, dude!\") Tidwell looks jealous and ingnored as he\n              leans against the airline counter, unnoticed.  A lone kid\n              approaches Tidwell.\n \n                                  KID\n                        Are you Hootie?\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (irritated)\n                        No man, I'm not Hootie.\n \n              Kid leaves disappointed. Tidwell sinks lower. Doesn't anyone\n              know his stardom, his essence, his power?\n\n\n                                                                     53.\n \n \n                                  BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT\n                        All those disabled, and Frank\n                        Cushman can board now...\n \n              INT. AIRPLANE -- DAY\n \n              Jerry sits next to Cushman, who is reading Bukowski's Notes\n              of a Dirty Old Man.  Across the aisle is Tidwell, who sits\n              next to Avery.  They are a small family, and Jerry feels at\n              home with his operation.  Cush looks up suddenly.\n \n                                  CUSH\n                               (a big thought)\n                        Jerry.  Why does God sometimes\n                        reward the evil and punish the\n                        good?\n \n              Jerry shares a look with Avery, who is on the other side of\n              Cush. Her stockings swish as she crosses her legs.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Let me think about that.  Want\n                        something to drink?\n \n                                  CUSH\n                               (thoughtful pause)\n                        I see what you're saying.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Wait.  What do you mean?\n \n              The two men have now totally confused each other. Tidwell\n              leans across the aisle to Cush, attempting comraderie.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        Hey man, I wish I had a\n                        quarterback like you in Arizona.\n                        You're the shit.\n \n              Cush looks up.  Compliments blow off him like a summer breeze.\n \n                                  CUSH\n                        Thank ya.\n \n              Tidwell waits for a compliment of his own, but Cush doesn't\n              offer one.  He returns to the book.  Tidwell feels slighted.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (loud mumble)\n                        Well you ain't that mothafuckin\n                        good.\n \n                                  CUSH\n                        Say what?\n\n\n                                                                     54.\n \n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        I said -- last I heard, Jesus\n                        Christ was still in heaven.  And\n                        you ain't even played in the NFL.\n \n              Cush throws his book away, ready for anything, as Tidwell\n              rises. Nearby passengers begin to panic.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        This can't be happening to me.\n \n                                  AVERY\n                        Jerry!  Do something --\n \n              Jerry throws himself in front of Cushman.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        HEY.  Knock it off.  What are you,\n                        five years old?  Am I taking the\n                        kids to Chuck E. Cheese here? Grow\n                        up, both of you!  We are a family.\n                        And we go to the draft in an\n                        ORDERLY FASHION.\n \n              Beat. Jerry wonders if he's pushed his mealtickets around too\n              much.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        Hey, man, I dig Check E.

That's\n                        just insanity, man.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        Heard that.\n \n              Tidwell reaches over, he and Cush exchange a fingertips five.\n              Briefly, the two clients bond. Past Tidwell, Avery smiles\n              engagingly at Jerry.  He handled the situation well.  She\n              crosses her legs, stockings swishing.  The workplace excites\n              her.\n \n              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT\n \n              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.\n              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media\n              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. (\"Is it\n              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  \"Cush!\")  Fans at the outskirts\n              are calling out to the young star (\"Go get the big chi-ching,\n              Cush!\") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.\n              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. (\"I'll either surf or\n              ski.\")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more\n              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.\n\n\n                                                                     55.\n \n \n              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at\n              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.\n \n              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER\n \n              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through\n              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.\n              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and\n              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear\n              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young\n              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure\n              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for\n              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is\n              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        At last I find you.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (sharply)\n                        Why the fuck am I here?  I feel\n                        like I'm five years late for the\n                        Prom.\n \n              In a look, Jerry sizes up the situation.  With a hand on\n              Tidwell's large shoulder, he smoothly pumps up the big man's\n              ego.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Come on.  Come with me.  We're\n                        going to take a walk through this\n                        lobby. I want every media guy,\n                        every player rep, everybody to see\n                        you for what you are.  The best-\n                        kept secret in the NFL. The\n                        biggest wide-receiver in the game.\n                        Let 'em see ya, Rod.  And Whatever\n                        you do, don't sit down. Let 'em\n                        see how big you are.  You ready?\n                        Let's do it.\n \n              He is privately thrilled, but offers only:\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (begrudgingly)\n                        A'right.  Let's walk.\n \n              We hear the ripping guitar explosion of The Who's \"Magic Bus\"\n              from Live at Leeds.\n\n\n                                                                     56.\n \n \n              INT. MARRIOTT LOBBY -- NIGHT\n \n              Maguire and Tidwell move through the brightly-lit lobby, past\n              the reporters, the competing agents, the team\n              representatives, the already blasted Jets fans, past even a\n              Nike crew filming an NFL spot in the lobby.  Portable phones\n              everywhere, in every hand.\n \n              There is a heavy white media light bathing everything -- as\n              if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it\n              concerned making other t.v. shows.  Jerry works hard,\n              introduces Tidwell around. And Tidwell is natural, polite and\n              charming, as they move through the pre-draft crowd.  He does\n              not sit down.  Music continues.\n \n              INT. MARRIOTT BAR -- DAY\n \n              Tough red-headed beat reporter PATRICIA LOGAN watches Maguire\n              and Tidwell from the opposite corner.\n \n                                  PATRICIA\n                        Dennis, try not to laugh.

ARIZONA CARDINALS WAR ROOM PHOENIX) -- NIGHT\n \n              Arizona General Manager DENNIS WILBURN, 48, is on the phone\n              here in the command center for the Arizona Cardinals.  All\n              around him, we see the boards and graphs for their upcoming\n              draft selections.\n \n                                  WILBURN\n                        Good, I hope he unloads him so I\n                        can buy a decent quarterback.\n                        Who's he talking to?\n \n                                  PATRICIA\n                        Right now, Dallas.

MARRIOTT ESCALATOR -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry and Tidwell rise triumphantly to the mezzanine level\n              above the bright-white lobby.  Maguire looks down at the\n              scene.  He breathes in the commotion.  In another twelve\n              hours, he will be at the very epicenter with Cushman.\n\n\n                                                                     57.\n \n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        I came all the way here for that?\n                        To walk the lobby?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Yeah.  And it might have even\n                        worked too.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                        Let's do it again.\n \n              Jerry doesn't respond.  Down in the lobby, Jerry catches a\n              glimpse of a familiar-looking agent.  It's Sugar. Jerry is\n              consumed with a thousand other thoughts, but Tidwell\n              continues talking.\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (continuing)\n                        You believe they're shooting a\n                        Nike ad down there?

CUSH'S SUITE -- NIGHT\n \n              We glide into Frank Cushman's suite overlooking Times Square.\n              It's filled with NFL swag -- free t-shirts, athletic bags,\n              sweatpants, and more.

Cush, who holds a guitar in his lap,\n              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL\n              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues\n              strumming the only song he knows on guitar, Cobain's\n              \"Something In The Way.\"  Jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.\n \n                                  CUSH\n                               (to hotel waiter)\n                        Hey, what size are you?\n \n                                  WAITER\n                        Eleven.\n \n                                  CUSH\n                               (grandly)\n                        Why don't you grab a couple pairs\n                        of them new Nikes by the door --\n \n              Waiter spots a very tall stack of new Nikes by the door.\n \n                                  WAITER\n                        Dude, you're like a God.\n\n\n                                                                     59.\n \n \n                                  CUSH\n                               (immediately)\n                        God, you're like a dude.\n \n              It's a great line, and the room breaks up.

Let me see,\n                        there's a speech that I'm supposed\n                        to make -- right! -- \"I'll be out\n                        there cheering for you.\" \"The door\n                        is always open!\"  See?

And Keith I\n                        bope you do call me.\n \n              Flushed and embarrassed, he exits.  We hang a beat on the\n              silent Cushman hotel livingroom, as Cush now continues on\n              guitar.\n \n              INT. LOBBY -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry exits elevator dazed, at full trot.  The Marriott lobby\n              is packed.  He is looking for Avery.  Beat reporter Patricia\n              Logan reappears.

BALLROOM -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry enters the grand ballroom, looking for Avery.\n              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and\n              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating\n              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the\n              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's\n              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls\n              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty\n              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty\n              tables.\n\n\n                                                                     64.\n \n \n              INT.

Standing here, watching Avery\n              coldly clasping her media packs to her chest, she looks\n              different to him.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Avery --\n \n              She knows what's coming.

She hands him a list of his\n              calls.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona\n                        to say he's faxing in the new\n                        Tidwell offer on Thursday morning,\n                        and you'll be happy.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (jolted into\n                                happiness)\n                        Happy.

DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- DAY\n \n              Dorothy looks for a jacket as Laurel helms the Divorced\n              Women's group in the living room.  Jan speaks through her\n              whistly braces, gesturing with a too-full glass of red wine.\n \n                                  JAN\n                        I broke up with the Cowboy.

HALLWAY -- NIGHT\n \n              Dorothy stops in the hallway to see that Jerry Maguire has\n              arrived at the back-kitchen door.  She watches unseen as\n              Maguire shakes hands with Chad the Nanny and is hit suddenly\n              by a flying hug from Ray.  He gives the kid an athletic bag,\n              which is filled with state-of-the-art promotional athletic\n              wear, etc. (\"Brought you some swag.\")  Ray continues hugging\n              Jerry.\n \n              INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry is a little embarrassed by the affections of the kid.\n              Dorothy enters.  Expertly breezy.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Hey, looks like you've got a fan.\n\n\n                                                                     87.\n \n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (outdressed)\n                        Wow.

It's a new\n              sensation for this bachelor.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Don't let him stay up too late.\n \n                                  CHAD\n                               (grandly)\n                        Hey, man, tonight I'm going to\n                        teach Ray about jazz.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Good, that'll put him to sleep\n                        early.

Ray backs down, as Jerry hears\n              snatches of the Women's group going full blast in the living\n              room.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        We'll see you soon, honey.

Jerry bends down\n              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's\n              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is\n              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit\n              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees\n              one.\n \n              INT. KITCHEN-- NIGHT\n \n              Laurel looks out the window, watches her sister exiting. She\n              is equal parts jealous and protective.  She spots keys on\n              counter. She grabs them and runs out to catch her sister on\n              the lawn. \"All Shook Down.\"  Replacements.\n \n              EXT. DOROTHY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry and Dorothy exit through the many cars which we now see\n              are parked on the street and the front lawn.  The sound of\n              the Women's group is heard in the warmly glowing house behind\n              them.\n \n                                  LAUREL\n                        Hey!\n \n              As Jerry moves ahead to the car, Dorothy retreats so she can\n              have privacy with her sister.\n \n                                  LAUREL\n                               (continuing)\n                        Forgot your keys --\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                               (privately)\n                        That's the first time I ever saw\n                        him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't\n                        that just... thrilling?\n                               (eyes tear up)\n                        I mean, he must have been needing\n                        that.\n \n              Women's group laughter in the distance as Laurel attempts to\n              glue her emotional sister back together.  She holds her arm.\n \n                                  LAUREL\n                        No no.

Music\n              continues.  Lit by streetlight, Dorothy runs like a young\n              girl, across the lawns of this car-filled neighborhood,\n              slapping away the leaves of a tree, running to Jerry down the\n              street.\n \n              INT.

Jerry, hand on face, is\n              embarrassingly being serenaded by the Mariachis, who now play\n              a mournful \"Tears in Heaven.\"  She smiles at the image, in\n              fact the poetry charms her. Dorothy moves forward, grinning,\n              fishes some bucks out of her pocket, and sends the Mariachis\n              in another direction.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Come on, let's take a walk.\n \n              INT. DOROTHY'S PORCH -- NIGHT\n \n              Music feathers into sounds of night.  A bug buzzing from the\n              nearby light, Jerry swats it away.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Well -- this would be goodnight.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Good night.\n \n              They don't kiss.

It's a good one.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Good night.\n \n              But they don't move.  He pulls her closer by her straps.\n              They break.  She holds them up, nervous now. His lips travel\n              down. He kisses her upper chest. She sighs deeply, she's\n              missed this feeling.  Jerry rises to kiss her lips again,\n              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a\n              decision to make. She concentrates on the styrofoam container\n              she's brought back from the restaurant.\n\n\n                                                                     92.\n \n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                               (continuing; breath)\n                        I think you should not come in, or\n                        come in depending on how you feel.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Same to you.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        No.  I have to go in.

That odd moment when\n              you've crossed the line.  He takes a breath.\n \n              INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n \n              Dorothy enters to find Chad watching t.v.  The house is now\n              quiet, the remains of the Divorced Women's group is still in\n              evidence.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        He's asleep, right?\n \n                                  CHAD\n                        Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Still going.\n \n              Chad raises his eyebrows.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                               (continuing)\n                        Shhh.\n \n              EXT. PORCH -- NIGHT\n \n              Jerry on the porch, as Chad exits.  Chad now fully plays the\n              part of friend with seniority.  Looks the taller Jerry up and\n              down.\n \n                                  CHAD\n                        Treat her right, man.

Jerry is somewhat\n              horrified at what Chad might be giving him.  Out comes a\n              cassette tape.\n \n                                  CHAD\n                               (continuing; intense)\n                        This... is Miles Davis and John\n                        Coltrane.

BEDROOM-- NIGHT\n \n              Fierce, driving jazz. Dorothy and Jerry making out on bed.\n              Getting hotter. The music gets wilder. Finally it is\n              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the\n              bed laughing.  She is left frozen, her arms open but he is\n              gone.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        What is this MUSIC?\n \n              They both crack up, and she kisses him as the music plays. He\n              looks at her. She turns away, then back again, he's still\n              looking at her. It's a powerful moment for her.  Laughter\n              continues, the music is ridiculous. (Their sex is a big\n              difference from the let's-be-intense sex with Avery.)\n \n              INT.

The lack of control in her life is overwhelming\n              her.\n \n                                  DOROTHY\n                        Oh God.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Easy, easy --\n \n              Jerry enters the kitchen, stands near Laurel.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing)\n                        I could pretend I didn't hear, but\n                        I won't, I heard everything.\n                               (to Laurel)\n                        Thank you for your honesty, as\n                        always.\n\n\n                                                                     96.\n \n \n                                  LAUREL\n                               (frozen polite)\n                        Coffee, Jerry?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        Oh, no thanks.

Dorothy, good morning, darling. He kisses\n              her on the cheek, in full view of Ray.  Dorothy, still\n              embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal.\n              Jerry sits down for breakfast.  They are an odd, but fairly\n              complete-looking family.\n \n                                  RAY\n                               (continuing)\n                        What's going on, Jerry?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                        A lot.

Ray looks around, he feels\n              happy, but there is something else in the room.  He shrugs\n              and continues to feel happy.\n \n              INT.

He looks over to the cab, where Ray is\n              making a sad face at him through the window.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (continuing)\n                        ...  what if we stayed together?\n                        What if we uh... got married.\n\n\n                                                                     107.\n \n \n              She looks at him.

DOROTHY'S BACKYARD -- DAY\n \n              Rod Tidwell sings Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\" at the\n              wedding for assorted guests gathered here in the backyard.\n              Contrary to his own belief, Rod is not a gifted singer.  In\n              the wedding band, standing on a small stage in the corner,\n              are Chad and Dooler.\n \n              ON JERRY\n \n              who stands watching, smile pasted on, with stoic FATHER and\n              well-dressed BROTHER.\n \n                                  BROTHER\n                        Where are all your friends?\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (looking around)\n                        In the band.\n \n              INT. DOROTHY'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT\n \n              We are close on Ray now as we hear the sound of a Reverend\n              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his\n              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every\n              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.\n \n              Dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame.  She calms him\n              with a hand on the shoulder.  And finally the cue comes and\n              he offers the ring.\n \n              INT.

And now the\n              enormity is evident on Jerry's face. Warm laughter in the\n              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.\n              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry\n              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He\n              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first\n              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.\n \n                                  LAUREL\n                        If you fuck this up, I'll kill you.\n \n                                  JERRY\n                               (as she exits)\n                        Glad we had this talk!\n \n              Nearby, Tidwell watches all.

Dorothy brings Jerry a Poloraid someone took,\n              and for a moment the couple stands awkwardly together.\n              Tidwell rubs Jerry's shoulders a little, announcing to the\n              room:\n \n                                  TIDWELL\n                               (continuing)\n                        This is my agent, man!

At the center is Marcee Tidwell.\n              Everything flows from her.  Next to her is Tyson, and then\n              the cousins, the neighborhood friends.  At this particular\n              moment, they are all screaming for Rod, who is taking a\n              beating, but is having a hell of a game.  In front of the\n              t.v., Tyson does the \"Daddy Dance,\" a dance of pure joy.\n \n                                  TYSON\n                               (proudly, to family)\n                        That's my motherfucker!\n \n              Marcee reaches out and collars her dancing son.\n \n                                  MARCEE\n                        Why don't you be the first man in\n                        your family not to say that word?\n                        And then we'll let you live.\n \n              Tyson nods, wide-eyed.\n \n                                  MARCEE\n                               (continuing)\n                        Now go kiss your daddy, quick.\n \n                                  TEE PEE\n                               (cooly)\n                        That's why they cheer, you know.\n                        The white man sending the black\n                        man into battle...\n \n              Marcee shoots him a look, as Tidwell takes another rough hit.\n \n              INT.

Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in\n              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two\n              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell\n              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,\n              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.\n              Tidwell is out cold.

And we can see a flash of\n              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two\n              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One\n              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body\n              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the\n              shoulders.

PARKING LOT -- DAY\n \n              Jerry, Dorothy, Ray exit into the daylight.  They walk to\n              Jerry's car. From across the fence, a stray baseball from a\n              pick-up game flies into the parking lot and bounces ahead of\n              them.  Ray picks it up. In an easy fluid motion, he whips it\n              back over the fence to the game on the other side.  A few\n              kids on the other side of the fence shout their approval of\n              a great little throw.\n\n\n                                                                     132.\n \n \n              Jerry and Dorothy stop, looking at Ray who has just shown\n              shocking natural ability.  They are quiet for a moment,\n              turning slowly to look at each other.  And then, not ready to\n              deal with it, not even close to ready to deal with it, they\n              say quickly to the boy:\n \n                           JERRY                         DOROTHY\n                   Come on, Ray.
