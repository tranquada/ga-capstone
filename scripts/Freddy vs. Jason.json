She hisses:\n\n\t\t\t\tLITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE\n\t\tFreddy lives!\n\n\tWith a quick swing, the little girl slashes the\n\tcommander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to\n\this throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.\n\tHe puts his boot on her, holding her down as he\n\ttakes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution\n\tstyle.\n\n\t\t\t\tS.W.A.T.

See... the world is\n\t\tmade up of rules. Kids don't like\n\t\trules. They rebel for a while, but\n\t\tultimately they start to fall in\n\t\tline and become ordinary Joe's like\n\t\tyou and me. But some kids... dope\n\t\tsmokers mainly, watching their MTV...\n\t\tSatanic lyrics melting what's left\n\t\tof their brains... these kids grow\n\t\tup to be punks.

Then pages of her\n\treport start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the\n\tWIND increases.\n\n\tA bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and\n\tspills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over\n\tto pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses\n\tit down but the WIND is too great and the skirt\n\tbillows up, revealing her underwear.

Her classmates fall\n\tover themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse\n\tblows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when\n\tthat too is swept off.\n\n\tMeagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start\n\tto drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost\n\tnaked.

The Dream Demons...?\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tFreddy made a pact with Satan when\n\t\the died... so Satan bestowed upon\n\t\thim the Dream Demons.

Jason could wreck\n\t\tFreddy on this side of the Dreamline.\n\t\tBut if Freddy has home court advan-\n\t\ttage... I don't know. Too close to\n\t\tcall. The trick would be to get Jason\n\t\tto enter a dream state, grab Freddy,\n\t\tand drag him out to our reality.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI haven't got a choice.

Then they shine their lights inside\n\t-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey\n\tmask.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tThe kids putting several plastic trash bags full of\n\tJason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming\n\tthe lid closed.\n\n\tEveryone piles into the car, exhausted.\n\n\tIn the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that\n\tStormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.\n\tErwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny\n\tand pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tLook... the boogerman!\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tGet it?!\n\n\tStormie slaps his hand away.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tGet back, you nasty-ass bastard!\n\t\tUg! I thought I had seen the last\n\t\tof those when my brother graduated\n\t\tthird grade!\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tWe just dug up a rotting corpse and\n\t\tyou're worried about a little snot.\n\n\tJesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball\n\tbeside him.  She purrs:\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI'm exhausted... wake me when we\n\t\tget back home.\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tUhhh... better not fall asleep --\n\t\twe've still got a lot of work to\n\t\tdo and Freddy's out there... waiting.\n\n\tThis news sobers everyone up immediately.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tWell, that means we've all got to\n\t\tstay awake!\n\n\t\t\t\tJESSE\n\t\tDuh?!\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI know! We'll sing a song!\n\t\t\t(starts singing)\n\t\tRow! Row! Row your boat, gently down\n\t\tthe stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,\n\t\tmerrily... life is but a dream. Come\n\t\ton, everybody!\n\n\tMeagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another\n\tchorus of \"Row Your Boat\" as Jesse's car roars off into\n\tthe night.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT\n\n\tMeagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly\n\tto herself as she drifts off to sleep:\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\t...merrily, merrily, merrily,\n\t\tmerrily... life is but a dream.\n\n\tIn the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's\n\tbreasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.\n\n\tJesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids\n\tdrooping.  The car starts to weave.\n\n\tANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding\n\ta cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL\n\tFOR FOOD.\n\n\tJesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate\n\ton the road, his eyelids falling once more.\n\n\tJesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-\n\tboard -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking\n\tout of the driver's window.\n\n\tCLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-\n\tground, the red digits cascading up.\n\n\tFreddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind\n\tthe wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in\n\this mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.\n\n\t\t\t\tFREDDY\n\t\tShouldn't dream and drive.\n\n\tFreddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes\n\tout from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --\n\tit's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes\n\tbelching HELLFIRE.\n\n\tANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids\n\tclose and his head nods forward, revealing the night-\n\tmaremobile closing from behind fast.\n\n\tThe nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's\n\tcar just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one\n\tof the dozen of levers on the dash.\n\n\tCLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version\n\tof Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back\n\tof Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into\n\tthe trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The\n\ttrunk lid opens.\n\n\tANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's\n\tremains are moving!  Freddy works another level and\n\tthe tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces\n\tof Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out\n\tof the bag.\n\n\t\t\t\tFREDDY\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLooks like the cat's out of the\n\t\tbag now!\n\n\tFreddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.\n\n\tThe nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's\n\tcar, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --\n\tall four occupants of the car are jolted awake,\n\tstartled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the\n\tnightmaremobile as it closes in again.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tIt's Freddy!\n\n\tWHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs\n\tas he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the\n\tdozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-\n\tmaremobile, staring out at her through the back window.\n\tA small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.\n\n\tJesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,\n\tthe pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the\n\tback seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front\n\tseat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines\n\tEXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING\n\ttheir way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's\n\tboots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards\n\tthe gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay\n\tunder the back window and kick Erwin in the head.\n\n\tAs Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,\n\tshe looks down and sees Jason's other hand between\n\ther legs.  Meagan screams.\n\n\tJason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches\n\tforward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile\n\tSLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it\n\tto swerve violently from side to side.\n\n\tInside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.\n\n\tCLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens\n\tup and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING\n\tinto Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,\n\tMeagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,\n\tCUTTING forward towards...\n\n\tCLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into\n\tit.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the\n\troad, veering into a tree line.\n\n\tCRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,\n\tthe HORN stuck on, BLARING.\n\n\tFreddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into\n\toverdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an\n\tEXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.\n\n\tIn the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go\n\ton inside.\n\n\tThe passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the\n\tground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear\n\tdoor opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in\n\tembrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers\n\taround to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse\n\tis laying unconscious against the steering wheel.\n\tMeagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.\n\tJesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJesse's hurt real bad... we've got\n\t\tto get him to a doctor.\n\n\tThrough the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see\n\tthe farmer on the phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tDon't worry... an ambulance is on\n\t\tthe way.\n\n\tMeagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tOh, God... Jesse...\n\n\tErwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the\n\tgarbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --\n\tuntouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tMeagan... listen to me... The cops\n\t\tare on their way. If they find me\n\t\tand Jason Voorhees in the trunk\n\t\tthere, we're finished.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tGo... get out of here. Take Jason\n\t\tand Stormie with you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tI'm staying with you.\n\n\tErwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tI'll call you at the hospital.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tHow?\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tSomehow!\n\n\tErwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains\n\tinto the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --\n\tgrowing close.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a\n\tspecial tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the\n\tdoorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he\n\tfinishes, Meagan asks:\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tIs he going to be okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\tYes. But he needs a lot of rest.\n\t\tHis leg is broken in four places\n\t\tand he has four broken ribs and a\n\t\tconcussion.\n\n\tMeagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.\n\tStormie turns to the doctor.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tHey doc, is there someplace I\n\t\tcould get us something to eat?\n\n\t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\t\tI'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.\n\t\tThere are some vending machines in\n\t\tthe lobby.\n\t\t\t(to Meagan)\n\t\tI'll be back to check on him in a\n\t\tcouple of hours.\n\n\tThe doctor exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tI'll be right back... I'm goin' go\n\t\tscore us some munchies.\n\n\tMeagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her\n\thead on Jesse's hand.\n\n\n\tINT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER\n\n\tStormie is getting several bags of munchies out of\n\tthe vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch\n\tat the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse\n\tand Erwin.\n\n\tStormie dashes for the staircase.\n\n\n\tINT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME\n\n\tJesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart\n\tmonitor BEEPS...\n\n\tOn the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy\n\tpeeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and\n\tducks back down.\n\n\tSuddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed\n\tand grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.\n\n\tMeagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs\n\tonto the curtain.\n\n\tCLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of\n\tthe rings.\n\n\tJesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing\n\taway.\n\n\tMeagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up\n\tagain, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires\n\tare pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful\n\tof tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But\n\tthe pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the\n\tmattress.\n\n\n\tINT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n\tMeagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As\n\tshe gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running\n\talong the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows\n\tthem to the saloon door, where she stops and looks\n\tout into...\n\n\n\tEXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n\tStanding in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed\n\tin a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,\n\tand gunbelt.\n\n\tMeagan calls to him from the saloon door.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tJesse!\n\n\tBut Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with\n\tfear... staring at something coming down the street.\n\n\tIt's Freddy.

This nightmare\n\t\tain't big enough for the two of\n\t\tus... draw!\n\n\tTrembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.\n\tHe pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse\n\tFIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again\n\tand again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs\n\tand laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tJesse! Wake up!

She sees\n\tMeagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,\n\tand screams.\n\n\tStormie enters the room a half-second later and\n\tgasps.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tFreddy killed Jesse...\n\n\tStormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out\n\tof the room.\n\n\n\tINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n\tStormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,\n\tthe screams of the nurse fading into the distance.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tJesus... get a grip, lady. You'd\n\t\tthink a nurse in a hospital would\n\t\thave seen a dead body before.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tJesse...\n\n\tJust then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting\n\toff the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and\n\tcome running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls\n\tMeagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch\n\tand company go thundering past.\n\n\tThen a VOICE on the P.A. says:\n\n\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\t(filtered)\n\t\tAttention. Would Meagan or Stormie\n\t\tplease pick up the white paging\n\t\tphone for a message?\n\n\tStormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The\n\tannouncement repeats itself again.  Then again.\n\tStormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up\n\tand picks up the white paging phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tThis is Stormie...\n\n\tMurdoch and his men come running past the nurse's\n\tstation again.

Stormie exhales a giant sigh of\n\trelief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:\n\n\t\t\t\tHOSPITAL OPERATOR\n\t\t\t(filtered)\n\t\tThe message is from Erwin... he\n\t\tsays to meet him at the side\n\t\tentrance in two minutes.\n\n\tStormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the\n\tstaircase.\n\n\n\tEXT.

He stops a\n\tshort distance away from the pier and the three of\n\tthem climb out.\n\n\tMeagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her\n\tas Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving\n\tplatform tied up to the end.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tWhat'd you do -- take him for a\n\t\tswim?\n\n\t\t\t\tERWIN\n\t\tAlmost.\n\n\tErwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,\n\ta large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie\n\tdown onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the\n\tpier.

Erwin has\n\tdone a good job of sewing Jason back together with\n\tbarbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have\n\tbeen reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's\n\tmask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with\n\tbailing wire.

MORGUE - NIGHT\n\n\tMeagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She\n\tcrawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops\n\tto the floor.

MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME\n\n\tThe windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,\n\tobscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,\n\tdeciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks\n\tthe front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.\n\tThey spot him coming and break their embrace.  In\n\tanother moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the\n\tparking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes\n\this head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.\n\n\tUp the street, parked with the lights off in the night\n\tshade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the\n\tguard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards\n\tthe morgue.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTORMIE\n\t\tHe's head right for her!

He starts back for the front, when suddenly\n\tthe HORN stops.\n\n\tMeagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling\n\tto Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan\n\ttumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.\n\n\tThe guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,\n\tdrawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully\n\tunlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.

He\n\tturns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMURDOCH\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSo... you wanna be a punk?\n\n\tMurdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.\n\n\t\t\t\tMURDOCH\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThen die like a punk!\n\n\tMurdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's\n\thand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason\n\tjams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and\n\tpulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor\n\twith a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We\n\tsee Murdoch's name written into his shorts.\n\n\tAs Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his\n\thand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat\n\tof his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the\n\tmuzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks\n\tthe shotgun and...\n\n\tBOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from\n\this torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out\n\tof shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his\n\tmetal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and\n\tspinning to a stop like a hubcap.\n\n\tJason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the\n\tfloor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men\n\tcome charging in.  They see Jason and raise their\n\tguns in panic.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tNO!\n\n\tToo late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-\n\tFIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan\n\tgrabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ\n\tpast.\n\n\tMore cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They\n\tstart SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio\n\tis crowded with muzzle flash.\n\n\tMore and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet\n\thole outline appears on the wall behind him.\n\n\tThe cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes\n\tup, \"More ammo! More ammo!\".\n\n\tVARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,\n\topening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,\n\tpassing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the\n\tcops in the studio.\n\n\tJason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying\n\toff.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away\n\tto reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off\n\tof his chest and head.\n\n\tFinally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The\n\tSHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving\n\tthe cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of\n\tgunsmoke in the room.\n\n\tAs it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,\n\tthen falls backwards with a mighty THUD.\n\n\tJason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason\n\treaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and\n\tpulls something out -- Jesse's heart.\n\n\tJason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head\n\trolls back -- he's dead.\n\n\tMeagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,\n\trevealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tINT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tMeagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the\n\tRaggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan\n\tturns out the light, Lizzy asks:\n\n\t\t\t\tLIZZY\n\t\tYou forgot to check under the bed.\n\n\tMeagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed\n\t-- nada.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tNo monsters here.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIZZY\n\t\tBut what if they come back?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tThen we'll just have to kick their\n\t\tass again.\n\n\tLizzy giggles.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIZZY\n\t\tI love you, Meagan.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI love you too. Go to sleep.\n\n\n\tINT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n\tAs Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up\n\tto her from the bottom of the staircase.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S DAD\n\t\tMeagan?\n\n\tMeagan looks down at her parents.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tYes, dad?\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S DAD\n\t\tYour mom and I... well, we want to\n\t\tthank you for saving your sister's\n\t\tlife... we know you went through\n\t\ta lot.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S MOM\n\t\tWe're going to be there for you\n\t\tfrom now on... for both of you!\n\t\tAnd that nice lawyer we hired for\n\t\tyou said he thinks he can get all\n\t\tthe charges dropped... except maybe\n\t\tfor the grave robbing and human\n\t\tdesecration ones.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S DAD\n\t\tEverything is going to be fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI know...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S MOM\n\t\tAnd I'm going to get sober...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S DAD\n\t\tWe're going to be a normal, happy\n\t\tfamily again.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tI know...\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S MOM\n\t\tGoodnight, sweetheart.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tGoodnight mom... goodnight dad.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN'S DAD\n\t\tGoodnight, Meagan.\n\n\n\tINT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tMeagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,\n\twhen the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\tHello?\n\n\t\t\t\tFREDDY\n\t\t\t(filtered)\n\t\tI'll be seeing you in your dreams...\n\n\tFreddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and\n\tlicks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the\n\tphone down.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEAGAN\n\t\t\t(sighs)\n\t\tI know...\n\n\tMeagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She\n\tclimbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal\n\tthe pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles\n\tand puts the pistol back under the pillow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t BLACKNESS:\n\n\tThe phone RINGS.\n\n\tROLL END CREDITS:\n\n\tThen... at the very end...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT.
