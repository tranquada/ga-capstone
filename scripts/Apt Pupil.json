This could be any suburban street\n     in America.\n\n\n     INT. CITY BUS - DAY\n\n     A boy is seated near the back of a moving bus.  This is TODD\n     BOWDEN, 15, as All-American as they come.  He stares out at the\n     other passengers indifferently.  Then something catches his eye.\n\n\n     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY\n\n     TITLE: SANTO DONATO, CA  FEBRUARY 1984\n\n     Todd pedals his bike down a quiet street and pulls up to an\n     unassuming bungalow set far back on its lot.  This is the kind\n     of house one would hardly notice driving through the peaceful\n     suburban community of Santo Donato.  Todd gets off his bike and\n     heads up the front steps.  On the way, he bends down to pick up\n     the L.A. Times.\n\n     Two signs, in laminated plastic, are secured neatly above the\n     door bell.  The first reads: \"ARTHUR DENKER\".  The second reads:\n     \"NO SOLICITORS, NO PEDDLERS, NO SALESMEN\".\n\n     Todd RINGS the bell.  Nothing.  He looks at his watch.  It is\n     twelve past ten.  He RINGS again, this time longer.  Still\n     nothing.  Finally, Todd leans on the tiny button, staring at his\n     watch as he does so.  After more than a minute of SOLID RINGING,\n     a voice is heard from within.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)\n             All right.  All right.  I'm coming.  Let it\n             go!\n\n     Todd lets go as a chain behind the heavy door starts to rattle.\n     Then it opens.  An old man stands behind the screen.  He is KURT\n     DUSSANDER, a.k.a. Arthur Denker.  Mid-seventies.  Standing there\n     in his bathrobe and slippers, a cigarette smashed in his mouth,\n     he looks like a cross between Boris Karloff and Albert Einstein.\n     Dussander stares at Todd, who tries to speak, but suddenly\n     cannot.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (continuing)\n             A boy.  I don't need anything, boy.  Can't\n             you read?  I thought all American boys could\n             read.  Don't be a nuisance, now.  Good day.\n\n     The door begins to close.  Todd waits till the last moment \n     before speaking.\n\n                          TODD \n             Don't forget your paper, Mr. Dussander. \n\n     The door stops.  Dussander opens it slowly.  He unlatches the\n     screen and slips his fingers around the paper.  Todd does not\n     let go.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Give me my newspaper. \n\n                          TODD \n             Sure thing, Mr. Dussander. \n\n     Dussander snatches the paper away and closes the screen door.\n     Quickly, almost imperceptibly, the old man's eyes survey the\n     area: across the street, up and down the sidewalk, the boy's\n     bicycle.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My name is Denker.  See?\n                    (pointing)\n             Denker.  Perhaps you cannot read after all. \n             What a pity.  Good day. \n\n     As the front door closes, Todd speaks rapidly into the narrowing gap.\n\n                          TODD \n             Bergen-Belsen, January '43 to June '43. \n             Auschwitz, June '43 to June '44.  Then you\n             went to Patin. \n\n     The door stops, still partly open. \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             After the war, you escaped to Buenos Aires.\n             From 1950 to '52 you were in Cuba, and \n             then... From 1952 to '58... I don't know.  No\n             one does.  But in 1965, you popped up in West\n             Berlin, where they almost got you. \n\n     The door opens wider. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Listen, boy.  I don't know what is the matter \n             with you.  But I don't have time for this \n             game.  Now, get out of here before I call the\n             police. \n\n                          TODD \n             Call them if you want. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Fine. \n\n     The heavy door slams shut. \n\n                          TODD \n             It's okay by me Herr Kommandant.  I'm sure\n             the police would love to meet the \"Blood-\n             fiend of Patin.\" \n\n     In a flash the front door is open, so is the screen.  Dussander\n     is through the doorway and descending upon Todd with the rolled\n     umbrella raised to strike him.  Todd stumbles back against the\n     porch rail. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You get away from this house, God damn you! \n             I'll beat you all the way home.\n\n     But Todd regains his composure quickly.  He brushes himself off\n     and levels his eyes at the old man who now hardly seems the\n     threat he was a few seconds ago. \n\n                          TODD \n             After 1965, no one saw you again... Until I\n             did.  Three weeks ago on the downtown bus. If\n             you want to call the cops, go right ahead.\n             I'II wait on the steps. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You'll do no such thing. \n\n                          TODD \n             I won't?  Listen, old man, if I want to start\n             screaming right here, I will.  If I want to \n             ride down to the police station and bring the\n             cops back myself, then I will.  I will do\n             what ever I want.  Do you understand?\n                    (pause) \n             But if you like, I could come in for a\n             minute.  We could talk. \n\n     Pause. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I'd be out of my mind to let an insane boy\n             like you into my home.\n\n     Pause. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Is that what you want, to come into my home?\n             So be it.  There is no arguing with crazy\n             people.\n\n     Dussander turns and steps back through the screen door.  He\n     stops at the threshold of the house and turns.  He is holding\n     the screen door open with one leg, the front door open with the\n     other.  He looks straight ahead.  A moment later, Todd steps\n     into the house. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Dussander's home is what you would expect of a single, poor, old\n     man.  Nothing fancy, nothing out of the ordinary.  Todd looks\n     around, perhaps half-expecting to find a Nazi flag or an oil\n     painting of Der Fuehrer hanging above the mantle.  But he\n     doesn't, and moves into the living room where an old picture of\n     a woman sits framed on an end table.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My wife.  She died in 1955 of lung disease.\n             At that time I was working at the Menschler\n             Motor Works in Essen.  I was heartbroken. \n\n     Todd's attention drifts away and his fingers slip over to a\n     lampshade next to the photograph.  He begins to feel it as\n     though he were inspecting it for something. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Stop that! \n\n     Todd jumps back a little but then recovers. \n\n                          TODD \n             Tell me, wasn't it Ilse Koch who made the\n             lampshades out of human skin?\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Now I don't know what you're talking about. \n\n                          TODD \n             Sure you do, Mr. Dussander. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Denker.  Denker.  Denker.  You don't listen,\n             boy.  The television has fried your brain. \n\n     Pause. \n\n                          TODD \n             Your hands are shaking. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes, they're shaking.  I'm old.  We all \n             shake.  You are most tiresome, and rude.  Now\n             if you have a point I wish you'd come to it. \n\n                          TODD \n             We're in no rush.  If I thought you had \n             plans, I'd say cancel them, but since I know\n             you don't... \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You know nothing of my business -- \n\n                          TODD \n             What business?  You sit in that ugly chair\n             and watch soap operas all day.  Except on \n             Friday afternoons when you walk down to the \n             movie theater.  And twice a week you take the\n             bus downtown to do your shopping.  You always\n             use the express lane because you never have \n             more than ten items.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You have been following me?\n\n                          TODD \n             Of course, I followed you.  You think I \n             normally go around to peoples' houses and\n             accuse them of being Nazi fugitives? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Perhaps for me you made an exception. \n\n                          TODD \n             No, for you I had to be sure.  For Kurt\n             Dussander I had to be absolutely certain.\n             ...Now, I am, and that's why I'm here. \n\n     Todd sits on the sofa. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Oh, yes, I see now.  As I am this ex-Nazi\n             fellow, as you say, then this must be the\n             part where I offer you my hidden stash of\n             gold, taken from the mouths of old Jewish \n             men, of course, which I keep buried in the \n             basement.  Isn't that right, boy?  Well, I'm\n             afraid you're wasting your time. I have no \n             money.  If I did I might even give you some\n             just to be done with this nonsense. \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't need money.  You don't have any \n             anyway.  At least, I don't think so.  You\n             probably had to spend it all to sneak in the\n             country.  A good American passport is \n             expensive on the black market, that I know. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Do you?  Good for you. \n\n                          TODD \n             Yes, I do.  I know it all, Dussander.  You're\n             my One Great Interest. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Your what? \n\n                          TODD \n             My One Great Interest.  Well, not you \n             personally, but, ...well, it's something I \n             learned back in eighth grade.  Our teacher,\n             Miss Harmon, she said we'd have to find our\n             One Great Interest in life.  You know, the \n             thing that would really grab us.  Once we did\n             that, everything would fall into place.  Like\n             hers, she said, wasn't teaching, but \n             collecting nineteenth-century postcards.  I\n             guess there's no money in that, so she has to \n             be a teacher.  Anyway, she told us to start\n             thinking about it.  So I did, but nothing\n             happened.  Until the following summer, in \n             Ronny Pegler's garage.  That's where I found\n             it.\n\n\n     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DAY\n\n     Todd and RONNY, both 13, rummage through several large boxes in \n     the corner of the garage.  We see that the boxes are filled with\n     old war magazines.  Ronny tosses several of them to the ground \n     as he digs for his dad's old copies of Penthouse.  Ronny selects\n     one Penthouse and rifles through it.  He discards it a moment\n     later. \n\n                          RONNY \n             One of these has three girls doing it at the\n             same time.\n\n     But the old war magazines catch Todd's attention.  He picks one\n     up curiously and carefully flips through the tattered pages.  We\n     see a few of the photographs:  Nazi storm troopers, prisoners\n     behind barbed wire, the ovens.\n\n                          RONNY (CONT'D) \n             I got it!  Check this out. ...Todd, look. \n\n                          TODD \n             Hang on a sec. \n\n     As young Todd stares into this secret world, his voice comes\n     in...\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             It was all there... pictures of stuff I'd \n             never seen, stuff they never put in the books\n             anymore, especially the ones they give us to\n             read.  And here were stacks of them. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     Todd speaks excitedly.  Dussander, very bored, clearly indulges\n     him.\n\n                          TODD \n             It... grabbed me.  It was just like Miss \n             Harmon said.  I couldn't believe it.  But\n             there it was, the camps, the uniforms, the \n             ...the way they saluted each other.  But what\n             am I telling you for?  You know more about\n             this stuff than anybody. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes, what are you telling me for? \n\n                          TODD \n                    (ignoring him) \n             Then last year I wrote my big term paper on \n             Dachau.  I got an A+.  It was the only A+ she\n             gave.  I mean I always do real well.  A's on\n             everything.  That's why I'm accelerated. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Accelerated? \n\n                          TODD \n             You know, accelerated.  I skipped two grades,\n             second and ninth.  I didn't need them.\n             That's why I'm already a junior. \n\n     Dussander sits. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I see...\n\n                          TODD \n             Some kids resent me for it.  That's not \n             important.  Anyway, my paper really floored\n             my history teacher.  I guess because I got \n             through all those books without throwing up.\n             But I learned something.  I learned that when\n             you talk about the camps now, you have to \n             remember to sound really disgusted.  I mean,\n             you can't just say what happened like the\n             magazines did and leave it at that.  If I \n             tried that the teacher would have freaked and\n             called my parents in. \n\n\n     INT. RONNY PEGLER'S GARAGE - DUSK\n\n     Todd sits on one of the boxes surrounded by dozens of the old\n     magazines.  The door to the house opens and Ronny, looking\n     cross, pokes his head out. \n\n                          RONNY \n             Todd, your mom's on the phone.  She says you\n             have to come home for dinner.  ...Todd? \n\n     Todd, lost in the sea of old photographs, doesn't notice Ronny\n     at first.  Then he looks up at him.  In his eyes is a glint of a\n     darkness that we will come to know better. \n\n                          TODD\n             What? \n\n                          RONNY \n                    (suddenly wary of Todd)\n             Your mom's on the phone. \n\n     ANGLE on Todd. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n                          TODD \n             Nowadays you have to... soften it. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Why do I care about this?\n\n                          TODD \n             Because, I don't want it softened. \n\n     Todd hops up and begins to pace the floor. Dussander stares at\n     him blankly, unsure of where this is going. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I am sure you trouble your parents to no end. \n\n                          TODD\n             Actually, I'm pretty low maintenance.  That's\n             what my dad says. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You told your parents about me, then? \n\n                          TODD \n             You think I'm crazy? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I think you're crackers, but go on.  I'm\n             riveted.\n\n     Todd looks deep into Dussander's eyes.  Dussander is\n     uncomfortable.  Slowly, Todd reaches out and brushes his finger\n     against Dussander's hand.  Dussander gets up. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             What are you doing? \n\n     Pause. \n\n                          TODD \n             And then it happened... I was on my way to\n             the library.  It was raining... \n\n\n     FLASHBACK: INT. CITY BUS - DAY\n\n     Todd's voice narrates what we are seeing.  Todd, seated near the\n     back of the bus, watches Dussander climb aboard.  Todd thinks\n     nothing of it at first, but soon finds that he is unable to take\n     his eyes off him.  Todd is trying to place the old man's face in\n     his mind... \n\n                          TODD (V.O.)\n             You climbed on the bus and started this slow\n             walk down the aisle.  Just like you were \n             examining a new batch of inmates.  I don't\n             think anybody gave you a second glance but \n             me, but somehow ...people seemed to move out\n             of your way.  And under your arm you carried\n             a rolled up umbrella.  But what really did \n             it, what really set me off was the coat.  You\n             were wearing this long black rain coat.  My\n             mind suddenly flipped back to a picture of\n             you taken at Patin.  You in your S.S. \n             greatcoat with a riding crop under your arm. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n                          TODD \n             It was incredible. \n\n     Dussander stares back at him flatly. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             All of this... because of a rain coat? \n\n                          TODD \n             Well, it wasn't that easy.  I mean, I had to\n             really check up on it.  And every picture of\n             you in those books is forty years old, at \n             least.  I went back to the library to find \n             the picture.  And then I matched it with the\n             photos I took.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You took photographs of me? \n\n                          TODD \n             Yeah, I got this little camera.  Fits right\n             in the palm of my hand.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (crunches cigarette into ashtray) \n             Clever boy.\n\n                          TODD\n             But even then I couldn't be sure.  I needed\n             real proof.  So I went to the mall and bought\n             a fingerprint kit from the hobby shop and a\n             book that tells you what you're supposed to\n             look for and then dusted your mailbox while\n             you were at the movies.  Pretty smart, huh? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You... put dust on my mailbox?  For \n             fingerprints?  You took photographs of me? \n             What else did you do?... I don't believe any\n             of this. \n\n                          TODD \n             I already had a copy of your fingerprints. \n             They're on your want sheet from the Israeli\n             government.  It's on database at UC Irvine.\n             Can you believe that? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Bourbon. \n\n     He storms toward the kitchen and stops. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Would you care for a drink, boy? \n\n                          TODD \n             Sure, you got a Coke? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             No Kok. \n\n                          TODD\n             Milk? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Milk. \n\n     Dussander disappears into the kitchen.  Todd stands alone in the\n     living room. \n\n     He lets out a long, nervous breath, showing for the first time \n     the presence of something other than the cold confidence he has\n     been putting up for Dussander.  He knows he has crossed into\n     dangerous territory from which there is no going back.  But \n     after a moment he composes himself; he has come this far.  The\n     sternness returns to his eyes.  Todd is all business.  He takes\n     a breath, and then speaks loudly enough for Dussander to hear\n     him in the kitchen. \n\n                          TODD \n             It takes eight good matches, they're called \n             compares, actually, for a fingerprint to get \n             accepted in court. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)\n             Is that right? \n\n\n     FLASHBACK: EXT. DUSSANDER'S FRONT PORCH - DAY\n\n     Todd steps up onto the porch and looks around calmly.  He pulls\n     the powder and brush from his pocket and begins to examine the\n     mailbox for prints. \n\n                          TODD (V.O.)\n             Yeah, there were two sets of prints.  The \n             first I figured were the mailman's.  Once I \n             knew what I was looking for, yours were easy\n             to spot. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)\n             You should be a detective. \n\n     The SOUNDS of a refrigerator opening and closing come from the \n     kitchen.  Drinks being poured.  Todd begins to move slowly\n     toward the kitchen. \n\n                          TODD \n             Maybe I will... Mom thinks I'd be good at it. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     He reaches the doorway just as Dussander turns around with the drinks. \n\n                          TODD \n             I found fourteen compares. \n\n     Dussander approaches him carrying a tumbler of milk and a glass\n     of bourbon.  He hands the tumbler to Todd, who brings it up to\n     his lips and hesitates. \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             You have some. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Good Gott.\n\n     He snatches the cup and swallows twice. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             You see?  It's milk, boy.  From Dairylee\n             Farms.  On the carton is a picture of a\n             smiling cow. \n\n     Todd pauses and then begins to drink. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n                    (more to himself than Todd)\n             ...And two missing children.\n                    (pause) \n             Boy what you have done, I have to explain\n             this to you because clearly you don't\n             understand, what you have done is a\n             violation. \n\n                          TODD\n             A violation? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Yes. \n\n                          TODD \n             Kind of like those experiments with the\n             decompression chamber.  Now, that was a\n             violation, Dussander. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             That fucking name.  Enough of that.  I demand\n             it. \n\n                          TODD \n             You what? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I demand -- \n\n                          TODD \n             You demand nothing from me.  Ever.  Get it?\n\n     Pause. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, I will tell you this once more, and for \n             the last time.  My name is Arthur Denker.  It\n             has never been anything else.  It has never\n             even been Americanized.  If you must know,\n             and apparently you must, I was named by my\n             father who greatly admired the stories of\n             Arthur Conan Doyle.  I did serve in the \n             reserves, I admit, and in the late thirties, \n             when I was first married, I supported Hitler.\n             I supported him most, I suppose, because for\n             the first time in years there was work and\n             there was tobacco. ...Would you like a \n             cigarette? \n\n                          TODD \n             No.  My dad used to smoke.  Mom made him\n             quit.  Now he's addicted to Nicorette...\n             that's nicotine gum. \n\n     Dussander turns toward the counter and pulls a kitchen match\n     from a cabinet.  He lights his cigarette with his back to Todd. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Nicotine gum. \n\n     Dussander's eyes drift to the collection of kitchen knives \n     neatly stuffed in their block on the counter in front of him. \n     He lingers a moment, pulls deeply on the cigarette, then turns\n     and continues.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             Anyway, Hitler lost his mind at the end, \n             directing phantom armies at the whim of his \n             astrologer.  He even gave his dog, Blondi, a \n             death capsule.  On May 2nd, 1945, my regiment\n             surrendered to the Americans.  I remember\n             that a private named Gonzales gave me a\n             chocolate bar.  I wept. \n\n     Bored, Todd sinks into a chair at the table.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             I was interned at Essen where I was treated\n             very well.  We listened to the Nuremberg\n             trials on the radio and when Goering \n             committed suicide, I bought half a bottle of\n             schnaps and got drunk.  When I was released, \n             I put wheels on cars at the Essen Motor Works\n             until I retired in 1963.  In 1967 I emigrated\n             here, to California, and became a U.S. \n             Citizen.  I am as American as you are.  I \n             vote.  No Buenos Aires, no Berlin, no koo-ba.\n             And that's it, my whole story.  I hope you're\n             satisfied. But if not, it's, as you say, \n             tough shit for you.  Now, you go.  Enough of\n             this.\n\n     Dussander points to the door, but Todd remains motionless in his\n     chair.\n\n                          TODD \n             That was pretty good.  So much to remember. \n             But I guess it helps when you have forty\n             years to practice your story.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Oh, to hell with this and to hell with you. \n             I'm calling the police.  Your father is \n             going to beat your behind when he picks you\n             up at the police station. \n\n                          TODD \n             No.  My parents don't believe in violence. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Well, they should start.  I'm calling. \n\n     Dussander steps past Todd and picks up the receiver of the phone\n     hanging on the wall above the table.  The boy still sits\n     motionless behind him.  Dussander dials a \"9\", and then, with \n     more difficulty, a \"1\".  He stands with his finger poised over \n     the final \"1\".  Tiny beads of sweat roll over his forehead.  His\n     shoulders drop.  Todd stands up.  Their faces are close\n     together. \n\n                          TODD\n             Hang up the phone. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             This is unforgivable.  Do you know the things\n             you're accusing me of? \n\n                          TODD\n             Do it. \n\n     Slowly, Dussander brings the receiver down onto its hook.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             If you don't want money, what do you want? \n\n                          TODD \n             I want to hear about it. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Hear about what? \n\n                          TODD \n             The camps. Everything.  The experiments. The\n             examinations.  All the stuff the writers are\n             scared to put in their books because people \n             will think they're sick.  That's what I want,\n             ...everything. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Everything? \n\n                          TODD \n             Exactly.  And you're going to tell it to me. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             You're a monster. \n\n                          TODD \n             According to history you're the monster. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             How could you ask me to remember such things?\n             I can barely remember to take my heart\n             medicine. \n\n                          TODD \n             You were there.  You did those things.  No\n             one can tell it better than you can.  And you\n             will tell it, starting today.  Right now.  If\n             you don't, I'll tell everyone who you are.  I\n             swear it. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Why should I?  Why should I do any of it? \n\n                          TODD \n             Because you hung up the phone.  That's why.\n             ...And just so you know, just so there is no \n             misunderstanding whatsoever.  Everything I\n             have on you, the compares, the want sheet,\n             all the photographs, are all in an envelope \n             under my mattress.  I'm going to put it there\n             every time I come to see you.  If anything\n             happens to me, if I should suddenly \n             disappear, some one will find it.  Believe\n             me -- \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             That's a foolish thing to do.  What if your \n             mother goes in your room anyway?  What if she\n             hires a maid? \n\n                          TODD \n             You better hope she doesn't.\n                    (looking at watch) \n             We're wasting time.  Let's get started.  I\n             have to be home for dinner. Today I want to\n             hear about the ovens.  How you baked them\n             after they were dead... and before. \n\n     Pause. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (to himself)\n             A boy... a boy...\n\n                          TODD \n             But before we start, put your teeth in.  You\n             look better with your teeth. \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DUSK\n\n     It is later the same day.  Todd emerges from the house.  The\n     setting sun tells us he has been inside for several hours.  He\n     picks up his bike and hops on.  He stops.  He turns to look up\n     the street in both directions.  No one.  A moment later he\n     pedals off down the street. \n\n\n     MAIN TITLES\n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n     TITLE: SEPTEMBER 1984\n\n     A typical high school image.  Rows of students sit listening to \n     a lecture from MR. PROXMIRE, fifties, as he weaves his way\n     through the aisles. \n\n                          PROXMIRE \n             But in 1902, Panama didn't exist.  The \n             country we know as Panama was part of\n             Columbia. \n\n     As the teacher continues to lecture, the camera stops on JOEY,\n     17.  On his desk is a folded note. He hands it across the aisle \n     and motions for it to be sent to Todd a few rows over.  The note\n     moves across the room, avoiding the meandering teacher, on its\n     way to Todd.\n\n                          PROXMIRE (CONT'D) \n             Now the nations of the west knew they needed\n             a canal through Central America.  They were\n             tired of waiting for their ships to sail \n             around Cape Horn.  This was the new century,\n             the age of modernization.  And the U.S. was \n             at the forefront.  Teddy Roosevelt was in the\n             White House, looking for any chance to assert\n             the might of America.  When Columbia balked\n             at the offer made by the U.S. and England, \n             Roosevelt sent his naval war ships to sit off\n             the coast of Panama, just sit there, where\n             they could be seen from the coast. \n\n     The FEMALE STUDENT across the aisle from Todd now has the note.\n     She whispers to him but he doesn't hear.  Todd is trying to say\n     awake with great difficulty.\n\n     The girl extends the note just as Proxmire passes.  He stops,\n     turns around, plucks the note from the girl's hand and heads for\n     the front of the class. \n\n                          PROXMIRE (CONT'D) \n             Finally Columbia gave up the territory for \n             about a tenth of its original price.  And as\n             Roosevelt would say later, \"The U.S. stole\n             the Panama canal fair and square.\"\n\n     Without glancing at it, Proxmire crumples the note and drops it\n     into the waste basket by his desk. \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY\n\n     It is in between classes.  The denizens of STUDENTS crowd around\n     their lockers.  Among them is Todd.  He searches through his\n     locker and selects a book.  Suddenly the door SLAMS shut to \n     reveal the face of Joey standing against the lockers.  Todd,\n     startled, jumps back. \n\n                          JOEY\n                    (laughs) \n             Take it easy, Jesus.  It's just me, flinch-\n             man. \n\n                          TODD \n                    (serious)\n             Don't do that. \n\n                          JOEY \n             I got news for you.  You're gonna like it. \n\n                          TODD \n             Walk with me to French. \n\n     The two walk down the corridor.\n\n                          JOEY \n             Someone likes you.  Someone good. \n\n                          TODD\n             Who? \n\n                          JOEY \n             Well, I heard my sister talking on the phone\n             with Lisa Herman, and... well -- \n\n                          TODD\n             You going to tell me who it is? \n\n     Two CHEERLEADERS pass them.\n\n                          JOEY \n                    (lowering voice) \n             You didn't hear it from me. \n\n                          TODD\n             Fine. \n\n                          JOEY\n             Becky Trask. \n\n                          TODD\n             Was that so hard? \n\n                          JOEY \n             So ask her out and the weekend after next you\n             can double with me and Vanessa. \n\n                          TODD \n             What about this weekend? \n\n                          JOEY \n             I'm already planning on being grounded. \n\n                          TODD \n             Grounded?  What for? \n\n                          JOEY \n             Where the hell you been?  Report cards were\n             sent out today.  I know that never affects \n             you... \n\n     They arrive at the door of Todd's classroom as the BELL SOUNDS.\n\n                          JOEY (CONT'D) \n             Shit.  Don't forget what I told you. \n\n     Joey runs off, leaving Todd looking after him. \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY\n\n     TITLE: OCTOBER 1984\n\n     It is late afternoon.  Dussander sits in a rocking chair facing \n     out into the backyard.  Todd is in the lawn chair off to the\n     side.  He has just finished a McDonald's cheeseburger and is \n     about to start another one.  Dussander eats a Big Mac, washing\n     it down with bourbon.  A large cat keeps jumping onto \n     Dussander's lap while he is eating.  He brushes it away annoyed. \n\n                          TODD \n             I've never seen anyone drink bourbon with\n             McDonald's before.  ...So, How did the stuff\n             get to Patin? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             In railroad cars marked \"Medical Supplies.\" \n             It came in long crates that looked like coffins. \n\n                          TODD \n             That's fitting.  Was it always Zyklon-B?\n\n     The cat jumps into Dussander's lap again.  He throws it down,\n     this time harder.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             No, from time to time we would be sent \n             something else.  Experimental gases.  The\n             High Command was always interested in \n             improving efficiency.  Once they sent us a\n             gas code-named \"Pegasus.\"  A nerve gas. \n             Thank God they never sent it again.  It...\n\n     Todd sits up a little, leaning in. \n\n                          TODD\n             It what? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It didn't work very well.  It was quite boring.\n\n                          TODD \n             Bullshit.  You're lying.  What did it do? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It killed them.  What do you think it did,\n             made them walk on water?  It killed them. \n\n     The cat jumps up a third time.  This time Dussander picks it up\n     and tosses it a good six feet.  The animal hits the ground and runs away.\n\n                          TODD\n             Tell me. \n                    (slurps on his Coke)\n             Tell me. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I won't.  I refuse.  Where are my cigarettes? \n\n     He finds the pack and fumbles a cigarette to his lips.  He\n     lights it.  Todd watches calmly, giving the old man a moment to\n     collect himself, and then... \n\n                          TODD\n             What did it do? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             It made them dance. \n\n                          TODD\n             Dance? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Like Zyklon-B, it came in through the shower\n             heads.  After a few seconds the prisoners \n             began to leap about.  Some were screaming.\n             Most of them were laughing.  They began to\n             vomit and to... to defecate helplessly. \n\n                          TODD \n             You mean they... they... shit themselves?\n             ...Woah. \n\n     But Dussander ignores him, staring out into the yard as he\n     begins to remember more easily. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             They began to twitch all over and make high,\n             strange sounds in their throats.  At last\n             they collapsed and just lay there on the \n             concrete, twitching and yodeling, with blood\n             streaming from their noses.  But I lied to\n             you, boy.  It didn't kill them.  Either \n             because it wasn't strong enough or because we\n             couldn't bring ourselves to wait that long.\n             I suppose it was that.  I sent five men in \n             with rifles to end their agonies.  These were\n             five men I trusted.  It would have looked bad\n             on my record to have wasted so many \n             cartridges at a time when the Fuehrer had \n             declared every cartridge a national resource.\n             I was always given high marks for efficiency. \n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah, I bet. \n\n     Dussander looks down at the remains of the meal in his lap. As\n     if his own story has suddenly disgusted him, he balls the food\n     up in its wrapper and shoves it into the paper bag. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             How do you eat this crap everyday? \n\n                          TODD \n             Why didn't you just do the job yourself? You\n             carried a gun, didn't you? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (incredulous) \n             I was the commandant of the camp.\n\n                          TODD \n             So you never killed anybody? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (getting frustrated) \n             The entire world was at war, boy.  People died. \n\n                          TODD \n             That's not a real answer.  I'm asking about\n             you. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, I was a soldier in a position of power.\n             You don't get to be there by selling ...girl\n             scout's cookies. \n\n                          TODD \n             I know what the SS was, Dussander.  Who are\n             you talking to?  It was a bunch of dumb, rich\n             kids who bought their way into the service so\n             they wouldn't have to go fight on the front. \n\n     Dussander stares at Todd, wanting to say something.  Todd\n     shovels a few more fries into his mouth, then looks up and sees\n     Dussander eyeing him. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             That's enough for today, boy.  I beg you.\n             I'm tired. \n\n                          TODD \n             Yeah, fine.  That was good story though.  You\n             always tell them good, once I get you started. \n\n     ANGLE on Dussander. \n\n\n     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #1: EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY\n\n     Dussander is asleep in his bed.  A low groaning sound comes in\n     very slowly.  Dussander's eyes open.  He sits up, looks around,\n     sees that his bed is in the middle of a large open field.  It is\n     grassy, but certainly not beautiful.  Something is wrong about \n     this place.\n\n     He stands out of the bed, wearing pajamas.  But it is cold.  He\n     takes the sheet and wraps himself in it.  The groaning is\n     getting louder, more human.  We have never seen him frightened,\n     until now.  He steps a few paces from the bed.  The groans have\n     becomes low screams.  There is no where to go.  Slowly, as if he\n     knows what he's going to see, he looks down at the ground.  It's\n     just grass.  But the human voices are now wailing desperately. \n\n     His knees buckle, but he tries to fight it.  He reaches his \n     knees and lowers his head toward the ground.  The white sheet\n     flows around him and blows off in a gust of wind.  The screams\n     are now at a feverish pitch.  His ear is inches from the grass\n     and his eyes, marked with unmistakable terror, are wide open\n     as...\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander bolts upright in his bed.\n\n\n     EXT. OUTDOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY\n\n     RICHARD (DICK) BOWDEN, 38, is a taller, grayer version of his\n     son.  He stands over Todd's shoulder watching him shoot at a \n     paper target.  He still has on a tie from work, but the knot has\n     been loosened and his shirt sleeves rolled up.  Both Dick and\n     Todd wear headphones and orange shooting glasses.  Dick chews\n     gum.  They are alone on the range.\n\n     Todd fires a few rounds from his father's .30-.30.  A strained\n     tension exists between the two Bowdens. \n\n                          DICK \n             You're tight.  Don't hold your breath so long.\n\n                          TODD\n             Forget it.  I can't concentrate. \n\n     He pulls off his headphones in disgust and hands the rifle to\n     his father.  Dick takes it and begins to reload it for him. \n\n                          DICK \n             I know your upset.  So am I.  So is your\n             mother. \n\n                          TODD \n             These honors classes... they aren't as easy \n             as I thought they'd be.  I totally admit it,\n             I didn't prepare enough.  I'm sorry. \n\n                          DICK \n             Well, fine, but now is not the time to slack \n             off.  You got a chance to finish at the top of\n             your class--\n\n                          TODD \n             Nobody wants that more than I do, Dad.\n\n                          DICK \n             Well you haven't been hitting the books very\n             much. \n\n                          TODD\n             I know... \n\n                          DICK \n             And seeing as you're not playing soccer this\n             year it's not like you don't have enough\n             time-- \n\n                          TODD \n             That still bothers you, doesn't it? \n\n                          DICK\n                    (with difficulty)\n             No, son. If you weren't enjoying it, then\n             you shouldn't play.\n\n                          TODD \n             I think it bothers you and you're not telling\n             me. \n\n     Dick decides to take a shot himself.  He readies himself and\n     fires. \n\n                          DICK \n             That was lousy.  Here. \n                    (gives the gun back to Todd) \n             I want to see your grades come up, buddy. \n             That's all that bothers me.  And if you say \n             you need more time to study, then that's what\n             we'll do.  The first thing is to cut out all\n             the time you spend reading to Mr. Denker. \n             It's a nice thing to do, but it's not helping\n             our school work a bit. \n\n     Dick is looking at his son, unsure if he has just seen a\n     contortion of rage on his son's face.  But Todd is cocking the\n     rifle and...\n\n                          DICK (CONT'D) \n             Hey, Todd.  You still with me? \n\n                          TODD \n             Yeah... no.  Dad, don't do that.  Please.\n             Don't punish Mr. Denker for something that's\n             my fault.  I mean, he'd be lost without me-- \n\n                          DICK\n             He'll be fine without you. He was fine before\n             and he'll be fine after. There's nothing \n             wrong with wanting to help people, but you\n             gotta make sure you got yourself squared away\n             first. That's what matters. \n\n     Todd turns to face his father, and speaks to him with a new\n     seriousness.\n\n                          TODD \n             Dad, am I like other kids? \n\n                          DICK \n             Not by a long shot. \n\n                          TODD \n             Then trust me on this.  Don't lose faith in\n             me because I blew a couple of exams.  I will\n             get my grades back up.  In fact I've already\n             started.  Three days a week I go over to \n             Freddy Tremain's for extra help. He's a wiz\n             at trig. But please, Dad, whatever you do, \n             don't punish a helpless old man for something\n             that's my fault. \n\n     Pause. \n\n                          DICK \n             Did you practice that in front of a mirror or\n             something?\n\n     Todd smiles.  Feeling his father caving in, he aims the rifle and \n     squeezes off a round.  Dick keeps his eyes on Todd as he shoots.\n\n                          DICK (CONT'D)\n             Hey, he's not...?\n\n                          TODD \n                    (it takes him a second)\n             ...No.\n\n                          DICK\n             Just checking. \n                    (thinks for a moment) \n             All right... We'll give your way a shot. If\n             you think you can do it, if you really do,\n             and your serious, then... okay. \n             You really like the old guy, don't you?\n\n                          TODD \n             I'm making a difference in somebody's life. \n             It's that simple.\n\n     Todd aims the rifle down range and pulls the trigger.  The gun\n     jams.  Todd tries to move the lever but it gets stuck. \n\n                          DICK\n             Okay, okay. \n                    (takes the rifle) \n             Don't ever force it.  Watch. \n\n     Dick begins to methodically unjam the gun. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DUSK\n\n     TITLE: NOVEMBER 1984\n\n     Dussander looks shabbier than in previous scenes.  His clothes\n     and hair reflect an increasing disregard for personal \n     appearance.  He goes to the basement door and, leaning carefully\n     over the steps, retrieves a fresh bottle from his stash, stored\n     precariously on some shelves leading down to the basement.  He\n     comes back to the counter and cracks the bottle open.  Todd's\n     irritated voice booms in from the living room.\n\n                          TODD (O.S.) \n             Don't get too drunk.  We still have a little\n             while. \n\n     Dussander mumbles contemptuously and then speaks so Todd can\n     hear him.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You don't have to do that, you know. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK\n\n     Todd has built a fire, probably the first fire Dussander's\n     fireplace has seen in twenty years.  The room is bathed in a\n     warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside.  Todd uses the\n     poker to adjust one of the logs. \n\n                          TODD \n             Screw you.  I'm doing this for me.  This\n             place is freezing. \n\n     Dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy\n     chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes, it must be fifty degrees outside.  I'm\n             sure to you it seems positively frigid.\n\n                          TODD \n             Why didn't you pay your gas bill?\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It slipped my mind.  I will attend to it\n             tomorrow. \n\n                          TODD \n             Slipped your mind.  I noticed it didn't slip\n             your mind to stock up on a new case of\n             bourbon. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Leave me alone. \n\n     Todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet\n     away.\n\n                          TODD \n             All right, so finish your story, because I'm\n             still not clear.  You cook up this stew, and\n             you bring the prisoner in, and you let them\n             smell it, and suddenly they tell you\n             everything? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Oh, don't misunderstand me.  Certainly with a\n             pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner \n             would tell us everything we wanted to know, \n             sometimes more.  But mine was a much more ...\n             elegant method.  Remember, it had been months\n             since they had smelled real potatoes\n             simmering over an open flame, and boy, when\n             that delicious odor hit their noses their\n             mouths would drop and out would pour an\n             account of every minor infraction their\n             friends had committed, I mean it was\n             magnificent...\n\n                          TODD\n             And you let them eat the soup? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Oh, we never promised them the soup in \n             exchange for information.  We never mentioned\n             it at all. \n\n     Pause.  Todd is impressed. \n\n                          TODD \n             Wow, that's really good, Dussander.  I mean\n             that's...\n                    (pointing)\n             that's thinking. \n\n     Dussander does not respond.  He gazes deeply into the fire.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             ...But, as the war pressed on, the time for\n             such civilized measures became a luxury.  I\n             remember by April of '45, we had barely\n             enough food to feed ourselves.  The sound of\n             the Russian mortars grew louder everyday, but\n             still, the train cars from France and Poland\n             kept coming.  This was a time of desperation.\n             The ovens burned day and night and still I\n             knew we would not beat the arrival of the\n             Russian forces.  Many of my men, the cowardly\n             ones, deserted during the night.  But the men\n             that remained, the same ones I had called\n             upon so many times, ...continued the work.\n             At first we thought a massive fire in the\n             main building would serve our purpose.  We\n             could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch\n             up to each of the windows.  But with so many\n             of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would\n             burn properly.  We needed something\n             ...certain.  Then a young, bright soldier, I\n             shall never forget his enthusiastic smile,\n             pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the\n             Western gate which had been used during\n             construction.  How perfectly simple it was.\n             The bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four\n             meters deep, down the center of the camp.\n             For two hours they dug until I realized we\n             may not have enough gas to finish the job.\n             So the inmates were given shovels and told\n             they were building a shelter from the\n             incoming artillery.  When they were done, I\n             immediately called for a practice drill and\n             three thousand naked bodies began to march\n             into the trench.  It took less than twenty\n             minutes to get them in place.  Quickly the\n             bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit\n             sending the piles of earth into the massive\n             grave.  Those who tried to free themselves\n             were shot, of course, but very few cartridges\n             were wasted that day.  The machines were too\n             fast.  Back and forth they went... packing\n             the dirt.  One by one the tractors ran out of\n             gas and my men had to scurry along with\n             shovels.  But by sunset... it was done.  I\n             gave the order to evacuate.  In the distance\n             the plumes of Russian mortar fire rose like\n             an approaching thundercloud.  But I knew that\n             no matter what happened, ...no one would ever\n             forget what we did here.\n\n     Dussander stares into the fire.  Todd, wide-eyed, is locked on\n     Dussander when...\n\n     The PHONE RINGS.\n\n     They look at each other, a bit puzzled.  Clearly, it does not\n     ring very often, and when it does, Dussander cannot help but be\n     apprehensive.\n\n     It rings again.  Dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen,\n     Todd watches him go. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Hello? \n                    (Pause. Then with apprehension) \n             Yes? ...No, no trouble at all. ...Yes.\n             ...Yes, he's here. ...I see.\n                    (his face softens) \n             ...Really? ...No, no plans. ...Ah, lovely. \n             ...My dear, I'd be delighted. ...Certainly.\n             ...Of course I will. ...Yes, until then.\n             ...All right. ...Good-bye. \n\n     He hangs up and turns to Todd with a odd grin. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             It seems I am to be your guest for\n             Thanksgiving dinner.\n\n\n     INT. OLD TOYOTA CAR - ROADSIDE - NIGHT\n\n     Todd and Becky are in the backseat of Becky's car.  They are on\n     a date and have parked on the side of a road overlooking the\n     lights of their town.  At 16, BECKY TRASK, is an attractive girl\n     who has recently discovered that boys like her and she likes\n     them.  They are kissing in the back seat.  MUSIC plays on the\n     stereo.  Becky's blouse is unbuttoned.  She stops kissing Todd. \n\n                          BECKY \n             Is everything all right? \n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah, I'm fine. \n\n     Becky smiles to herself, unconvinced. \n\n                          BECKY \n             You're nervous.  I think it's sweet. \n\n                          TODD\n             No... No, I'm cool. \n\n                          BECKY \n             Do you want me to do something else? \n\n     Todd just stares at her.  He doesn't know what he wants.  Becky\n     decides for him.  She slides down out of the frame.  Todd is\n     startled at first, but lets her.  After a moment, he closes his\n     eyes. \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander sits in his rocking chair.  A small blanket drapes\n     across his lap.  He smokes a cigarette and holds a near-empty\n     glass.  On the ground beside him, there is a small bowl.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Here kitty-kitty.  Here kitty-kitty. \n\n     Out in the yard, the large cat emerges from the darkness and\n     moves across the grass.  It sees Dussander and, more \n     importantly, the bowl next to him.  We see that the bowl is\n     filled with milk. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Come, puss-puss.  That's right.  I'll wait. \n\n     Dussander sits perfectly still.  Cautiously, the cat moves\n     toward the porch. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             That's right, puss-puss.  You can smell it\n             now, can't you? \n\n     The cat creeps to the edge of the steps.  It takes them one at a\n     time.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             That's right, kitty-kitty.  That's right.\n\n     After a moment the cat edges up to the bowl.  Its tail twitches\n     nervously.  Finally, it begins to lick up the milk.  Dussander\n     crunches the cigarette out in his empty glass.  His movements\n     are slow and patient.  From under the blanket he pulls a pair of\n     yellow rubber gloves.  He begins to put them on.  The cat jumps\n     back for a moment.  Dussander freezes.  He waits the cat out. \n     Soon the animal is back at the bowl.  Dussander continues with\n     the gloves.  He watches the cat's tail.  As the animal gets\n     comfortable, its tail flips under the rail of the rocking chair.\n     Dussander slams the chair back.  The CAT SHRIEKS.  Dussander\n     flips the blanket on top of the cat and wraps it into a tight,\n     squirming, HISSING bundle.  He stands out of the chair. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Gotcha. \n\n\n     INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - ROADSIDE - NIGHT\n\n     It is later.  Becky sits behind the wheel.  Todd is next to her.\n     A different song is on the RADIO.  They sit for a moment in\n     silence, clearly uncomfortable. \n\n                          TODD\n             I'm sorry. \n\n                          BECKY \n             It's all right.  Maybe you'll be more in the\n             mood later. \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't know.  That's never happened before. \n\n     Becky lights a joint.  She takes a puff and exhales toward Todd.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Can you blow that the other way? \n\n                          BECKY \n             Maybe you don't like me. \n\n                          TODD\n             No, I do. \n\n                          BECKY \n                    (exhaling out the window)\n             Maybe you don't like girls. \n\n     For a moment it is as though Todd's face were purple with rage.\n     But a moment later the expression is gone.  Todd turns away.\n     Becky sees that her comment has hurt him. \n\n                          BECKY (CONT'D)\n             That was a lousy thing for me to say.  I'm\n             sorry, honey.\n\n     She kisses him on the cheek.  He nods reluctantly. \n\n                          TODD \n             Let's just go home. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander bursts through the door with the bundle.  A single paw\n     emerges from the corner of the blanket and flails at Dussander, \n     clawing him across the neck.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Oww, you mother-fucker. \n\n     They move across the room to the stove.  With difficulty,\n     Dussander pulls open the oven door, revealing the glowing red\n     interior.  The animal SCREAMS and claws at Dussander's neck and\n     arms, escaping more and more from the blanket with every \n     gyration of its body.  With a mighty shove Dussander plunges the\n     cat toward the opening, but the animal braces its paws on the\n     edge of the stove.  The two are deadlocked.  But Dussander's \n     hands are too close to the heat.  He screams.  His grip loosens\n     just enough.  With a desperate cry, the animal charges up\n     Dussander's body, over his head, and leaps to the floor.\n     Dussander dives after it. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Come here! \n\n     But the animal is too swift.  In a second, it is atop the\n     counter and out the open window above the sink.  Although\n     defeated and exhausted, Dussander cannot contain his excitement.\n     His panting gives way to a twisted, hearty laugh. \n\n\n     TODD'S DAYDREAM: INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY\n\n     This is a 1940's laboratory.  Todd is in his boxer shorts.\n     Dussander is next to him, wearing a lab coat and his S.S.\n     officers hat.  Todd looks down on the examination table.  A\n     YOUNG GIRL, about 16, is held to the table with clamps.  She is \n     naked, staring at Todd.  Behind the table is a glass window and \n     behind that is another room where OTHER SCIENTISTS are\n     monitoring equipment.\n\n     Over Dussander's methodical voice, Todd's dream shows flashes of\n     what is being done: some sort of sexual experiment on the girl. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (to other scientists) \n             Test run eight-four.  Electricity, sexual \n             stimulus, metabolism.  Based on the Thyssen\n             theories of negative reinforcement. \n\n     Dreamlike SOUNDS and images pass before us: Todd's breathing,\n     the girl's cry, electrical equipment, naked flesh, maybe\n     Todd's, maybe the girl's. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             Subject is a young Jewish girl, approximately \n             sixteen years of age, no scars, no\n             identifying marks, no known disabilities -- \n\n     Inside the control room, a SCIENTIST monitors a volt meter, \n     calling out the readings as Dussander yells for the voltage to\n     be increased.  As the meter rises, the girl SCREAMS more \n     violently.  Perhaps her eyes roll back, her tongue flutters in \n     her mouth.  Through all of this, the scientists call out and the\n     record heart rate, blood pressure, brain activity, voltage, etc.\n     Todd's eyes close.  His breathing accelerates as does the motion\n     of his hips until... \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY\n\n     Todd snaps out of his daydream.  His trigonometry class is\n     having an examination.  He sits at his desk, staring blankly at\n     the paper before him.  Most of the answer spaces are empty.  He\n     knows he is going to fail another test. \n\n\n     EXT. OUTOOOR SHOOTING RANGE - DAY\n\n     Todd is blasting away, rapid-firing the rifle down range at an\n     unfortunate paper target.  The protective headphones lay on the\n     counter beside him, as does his backpack.  He stops shooting\n     when a voice snaps over the P.A. speaker next to him. \n\n                          VOICE (O.S.) \n             You, on lane twelve.  You need to have your \n             headgear on at all times. (click) And no\n             rapid firing.\n\n     Todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small\n     booth.  Todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man \n     goes back to reading a newspaper.  Todd looks up and down the \n     range.  One or two other shooters are concentrating on their \n     targets.  Todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the \n     man in the booth.  He snaps off a single dry round.  Todd smiles\n     weakly at the sound of the click.  Unnoticed by anyone, he turns\n     back toward the target, strangely comforted.\n\n\n     INT. DINING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Thanksgiving dinner.  All the Bowden's are there, including\n     Dick's parents, VICTOR and AGNES. Dussander sits at the head of \n     the table, Todd next to him.  The family has finished dinner and\n     is having coffee.  Dick and his father smoke cigars.  Todd's \n     mother, MONICA BOWDEN, still pretty at 36, pours Dussander some\n     more coffee. \n\n                          MONICA\n             Todd loved that dog.  A lot more than Dick \n             did. \n\n                          DICK \n             We all loved that dog. \n\n                          AGNES\n             I remember when you had to put it down, Todd\n             cried for two weeks.  Just about broke my\n             heart. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Excuse, me, Mrs. Bowden.  Put it down?  I've\n             been here over twenty years but that's a new\n             one. \n\n                          VICTOR \n             Means put it to sleep, Victor.\n\n     Dussander still looks puzzled.  He looks to Todd, but Victor\n     jumps in.\n\n                          VICTOR (CONT'D) \n             Well, it's how they kill it, Arthur. They do\n             it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs,\n             dogs nobody wants.\n\n                          MONICA\n             It's very humane.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I see. \n\n     Todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others don't notice.\n\n                          MONICA \n             Some more pie? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             As my departed wife used to say, 'One must\n             never overdo the sublime.' \n\n                          AGNES \n             It was delicious, Monica. \n\n                          VICTOR \n             Tell me, Arthur, if you don't mind me asking.\n             What did you do during the war? \n\n                          AGNES \n             Now don't get too personal, Victor. \n\n     A quick moment between Todd and Dussander.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I was a student at the University until my\n             reserve unit was called in 1943.\n                    (notices Victor) \n             But we were not a combat unit, thank God.\n             Mechanical engineers.  Help me find my \n             cigarettes, Todd.  Would you?  In those days,\n             not even the call of higher learning could\n             exempt an able body from military service.\n\n     Dussander's cigarettes are right in front of him.  Todd fetches\n     one and, bringing it to his own lips, lights it for him.\n\n                          MONICA\n             Todd Bowden!\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (laughs knowingly) \n             My dear, I do apologize.  My hands are too\n             arthritic to strike a match, I'm afraid. \n             Your son has been good enough to help an old\n             man with his filthy habits. \n\n                          MONICA \n             Well...as long as you don't inhale. \n\n                          TODD \n             Cigarettes are gross, Mom. \n\n                          VICTOR \n             Well, Victor, you were doing your part like\n             we all were, I suppose.  Of course, if you \n             were in the Pacific Fleet I'd have to shoot\n             you. \n\n     Everyone laughs, except Todd.\n\n                          DICK\n                    (to Dussander) \n             My dad is very proud of the fact that the\n             Bowden men have hit every major conflict\n             since the Civil War. \n\n                          VICTOR \n             That's right.  Dickie served two tours in \n             Vietnam.  Earned a bronze star and a purple\n             heart. \n\n                          DICK \n             It's one family tradition I'd like to put an\n             end to.  Todd and I blow a few caps down at \n             the range every week.  That's all the combat\n             he needs.\n\n                          TODD \n                    (perking up, offended) \n             What's that supposed to mean? \n\n                          DICK\n             Forget it. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (looking at Todd) \n             Perhaps your son would excel in combat. \n\n                          MONICA \n             Todd could excel at anything.  Right, honey?\n\n     Todd doesn't answer.  His eyes are still on Dick.  Dick notices\n     him. \n\n                          AGNES \n                    (getting up, starts to clear some\n                    dishes) \n             Oh, let's don't even talk about this. I can't\n             stand to think of you boys fighting another\n             war.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             The Purple Heart.  You were injured? \n\n                          TODD \n             He was knocked unconscious and woke up in a\n             hospital.\n\n     A long pause.  Dick is embarrassed and offended by Todd's stab.\n     He puffs on his cigar.  Agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks\n     up some more dishes.  Dick stands suddenly to help her.\n\n                          DICK \n             Mom, let me get that for you. \n\n\n     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SIDEWALK - NIGHT\n\n     Todd and Dussander walk together in silence.  Todd is clearly in\n     a bad mood.  Dussander prods him.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You shouldn't be so hard on your father. \n\n                          TODD \n             Why don't you mind your own business. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (amused at Todd's short fuse) \n             Boy, It's not so easy to raise children. Your\n             father does the best he can, I'm sure. Having \n             his own father there is bound to cause some\n             anxiety on his part-- \n\n                          TODD \n             Oh, give me a frigging break, will you?  Look\n             who's talking to me, for Christ's sake.  And\n             what was that crap about the dog?  If you \n             were any more charming I was going to puke. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the \n             point?  I used the evening to our advantage. \n\n                          TODD\n             Our advantage?  Our advantage?\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Certainly now they will offer no objections \n             if you continue to come over and read to me. \n\n                          TODD \n             You sure take a lot for granted.  Do you \n             think there's anybody forcing me to come over\n             to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up\n             booze all day?  Do you? \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Lower your voice.  People will hear. \n\n                          TODD\n             So what?\n\n     Dussander stops. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             No, nobody forces you to come.  In fact, you\n             are welcome to stay away.  Believe me, boy, I\n             have no scruples about drinking alone.  None\n             at all.\n\n     They start walking again.  Dussander turns up his driveway.\n     Todd follows.\n\n                          TODD \n             You know, if they found out what you are,\n             they'd spit on you. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I am sure they would have nothing but \n             revulsion for me.  But what would they say\n             about you, boy, when I told them you had \n             known about me for nine months... and said\n             nothing? \n\n     Dussander unlocks his door and steps in.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Come and see me if you please, and stay home\n             if you don't.  Good night, boy.\n\n     He closes the door. \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     TITLE: DECEMBER 1984\n\n     Todd places a brightly wrapped Christmas present on the table in\n     front of Dussander, who looks at it skeptically. \n\n                          TODD \n             Go ahead, open it.  Wait, I better pull down\n             the shades, first. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             What for? \n\n                          TODD\n             Just to be safe. \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (getting up) \n             To hell with this.  You open it. \n\n                          TODD\n             Oh, relax, old man.  Sit down and open it. \n\n     Todd opens the refrigerator and pulls out a can of Coke.\n     Dussander slowly sits back down. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You wrapped it yourself, I see. \n\n     He begins to remove the bow, and then the paper.  He moves very\n     cautiously, as if the package might explode at any moment.\n\n     Finally, he removes the lid and his expression shifts from one\n     of fear to one of exasperation. \n\n                          TODD\n             Merry Christmas!\n\n     We see that the box contains a replica of an officer's S.S. \n     uniform, complete with hat and jackboots.  Dussander reads the\n     label.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Pete's Quality Costume Clothiers - Serving \n             You Since 1976.\n\n                          TODD \n             Go ahead, try it on. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Are you out of your mind, boy?  What makes \n             you think I would put something like that on? \n\n                          TODD \n             I thought you'd like it --\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Like it?  My God, you're a bigger fool than I\n             thought.  Maybe I'll put it on and do a \n             little shopping downtown.  Is that what you\n             thought?  You stupid, boy. \n\n                          TODD \n             Don't call me stupid. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You... You know, you are correct.  I am the \n             stupid one.  For months I have suffered your\n             indignities.  I have exposed my past to you \n             while watching you stuff your face with those\n             wretched hamburgers.  I have stocked my \n             refrigerator with Coca Cola and ding dongs. \n             All for you, I have done these things and I'm\n             tired of it.  But because I value my life and \n             my freedom, what's left of it anyway, I do\n             them.  But I'll die before I put this thing\n             on, you fucking piss-ant. \n\n                          TODD \n             That's enough.  You don't get to talk to me\n             like that. \n\n     Dussander bangs the table.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I should smash you. \n\n                          TODD\n             Do it.  Please.\n                    (pause) \n             Indignities?  What you've suffered with me is\n             nothing compared to what the Israelis would\n             do to you.  Remember what happened to \n             Eichmann?  You forget that, I think.  And,\n             you know, that's my fault.  I have let you\n             forget.  You have gotten comfortable with\n             this situation.  Well, don't you for one \n             minute ever forget who holds the cards here.\n             Don't you ever forget that envelope under my \n             mattress.  I tried to do this the nice way, I\n             tried to do something to please you, but you \n             don't want it.  So fine, we'll do it the hard\n             way.  You will put this on because I want to \n             see you in it.  Now strip.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I hope you go to hell -- \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     It is five minutes later.  Dussander stands in the uniform.  He\n     looks at it indignantly.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             The insignia is all wrong.  The boots should\n             be leather, not imitation. \n\n                          TODD \n             That suit cost me over eighty bucks... with\n             the boots. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             And this material... what?  Polyester? \n\n                          TODD \n             Quiet.  Straighten that hat. \n\n     Dussander ignores him.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Straighten that hat, soldier!\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Good Gott. \n\n     Dussander does what he is told. \n\n                          TODD\n             Actung!\n\n     Slowly Dussander straightens up.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Now, march... Do it!\n\n     Dussander begins to move his feet in place. \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             That's it.  March.\n\n     Dussander has gotten into a rhythm, marching faster in place.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             About face.\n\n     Dussander spins sharply on his heels.  He continues to march.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             About face. \n\n     Dussander is stomping in place vigorously.  He spins on command,\n     facing Todd.  He gives a Nazi salute.  Todd watches him march\n     for a moment.  At first he enjoys the domination, but as \n     Dussander gets caught up in the marching, Todd's expression changes. \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Okay, that's enough. \n\n     Dussander is still marching furiously. \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             I said that's enough! \n\n     Suddenly Dussander stops.  He collapses into a chair, exhausted.\n     He sits there panting for a moment. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy... be careful. You play with fire. \n\n\n     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #2: INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander wakes to a strange, faint rumble.  He climbs out of\n     bed and walks across his bedroom toward the source of the sound.\n     We follow him as he moves farther and farther away from his bed.\n     Soon it is apparent that he is in a space much larger than his\n     room.  Yet he is still in darkness, as if his room has suddenly\n     ended and continues into a black void.\n\n     But the rumble gets louder, more mechanical sounding.  As the\n     sound crescendoes we see what Dussander sees.  A train car.\n     Steam rises in the air as if the train has just come to a\n     complete stop in the night.\n\n     Dussander stares at the boxcar coldly, and we realize that\n     something is staring back at him.  Eyes, dozens of them, glare\n     back at him from between the slatted boards of the train.  Some\n     are low to the flooe, like those of children.  Others are\n     higher.  Dussander snaps at them in German.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (in German)\n             Come out. ...Come out, now!\n\n\t No one exits the train.  Yet, the eyes seem to move around\n     cautiously within the boxcar.  Dussander is getting angry.  His\n     orders aren't being carried out.  Suddenly the door of the train\n     slides open.  But still only the eyes are visible.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n                    (in German)\n             Line up in front of the train. Now!\n\n     Again, no one gets off.  Enraged, Dussander takes a few steps\n     toward the train.  In a flash the eyes charge at him.  But these\n     are not the eyes of prisoners.  These are wolves.  Dussander can\n     only cover his face with his arms as the snarling teeth descend\n     upon him.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander wakes from his nightmare in a cold sweat. His pajamas\n     are soaked. Disoriented and out of breath, he climbs out of bed\n     and clicks on the light.\n\n     The closet. He stares at the closed closet door for a moment and\n     then moves toward it slowly. He opens the door and runs his\n     fingers across the assortment of shirts and jackets. His hand\n     stops near the back.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER\n\n     Dussander is seated on the side of the bed smoking a cigarette.\n     He is dressed, with the exception of the boots and hat, in the \n     SS uniform.  He appears calmer, less agitated.  He crunches out\n     the cigarette and slips under the covers.  He turns off the\n     light.  He closes his eyes.  For the moment, he is at peace.  \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - DAY\n\n     Todd stands facing his open locker.  He is staring at his report\n     card.  Sweat collects on his forehead.  He looks like he is \n     about to explode.  He wipes his brow with his sleeve and turns\n     around to see if anyone notices him.  TWO STUDENTS catch his \n     eye.  They are both Asian.  They are smiling and pouring over \n     each other's report cards.  Todd zips open his backpack, giving\n     us a quick glimpse of the disassembled rifle pieces inside.  He\n     throws the report card in and zips up the bag.  Slinging the bag\n     over his shoulder, he slams the locker shut and heads off down\n     the hall.\n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY\n\n     Todd is shooting baskets with Joey.  It is after school.  Todd\n     wears a white T-shirt.  Off to the side, we see the dress shirt\n     he was wearing earlier and his school bag.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             So what are you going to do? \n\n                          TODD\n             Fuck if I know.  \n\n     Todd throws up a clumsy shot.  It misses.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             You're throwing it flat.  Let it roll off\n             your fingers more.  \n\n                          TODD \n                    (snapping at him)\n             I don't need a lesson.  \n\n     Todd adjusts his grip on the ball anyway.  He shoots again.  No\n     good.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             Your dad, man.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm a\n             fuck up.  My dad is used to this crap from \n             me.  \n\n     Todd does not respond to his friend's attempt at humor.   He is\n     slamming the ball around with great force.  He bounces it hard\n     off the back wall to give himself a rebound.  He is mumbling to\n     himself.  \n\n                          JOEY\n             What? \n\n                          TODD\n             What? \n\n                          JOEY \n             You said something? \n\n                          TODD\n             No.\n\n                          JOEY \n             You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  It's not\n             the first time I've noticed it.  What is \n             going on with you?\n\n                          TODD \n             Nothing, Joey.  I fucked up.  I'II fix it.  \n             I'II fix it.  \n\n                          JOEY\n                    (hurt) \n             All right, man.  Whatever you say.  Look, I\n             got to get to practice.  \n\n     No response from Todd.  \n\n                          JOEY (CONT'D) \n             If you need to talk, you can call me.  You\n             know that.  I'II see you around.  \n\n     Joey walks off.  Todd continues shooting the ball.  \n\n                          TODD\n                    (mumbling) \n             You're talking to yourself, Bowden.  You're\n             talking to yourself, Bowden.  \n\n     He throws up a shot.  It is good.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             I'II fix it.  I'II fix it.  \n\n     A strange SQUAWKING sound is heard.  Todd doesn't hear it at\n     first, but as the sound grows louder Todd stops the ball and \n     looks around.  His eyes focus on the area near an open doorway.\n     Sunlight streams into the empty gym.  Todd walks closer, seeing\n     that the sound is coming from an injured bird that has crawled \n     in from outside.  He goes up to it.  The bird is black.  Its \n     wing is damaged.  It SQUAWKS loudly, looking up at Todd.  Todd\n     begins mumbling again.  He starts to dribble the ball \n     thoughtlessly.  As his words become clearer, the bouncing gets\n     harder.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  I'll fix it.  \n\n     Todd is bouncing the ball very hard next to him.  The bird\n     continues to SCREAM.  Slowly the ball drifts from beside Todd to\n     in front of him, gaining force with every bounce.  He brings it\n     up to his face and with both hands throws it down with all his\n     might.  When it comes back up, it is smeared with blood.  He\n     throws it down again, this time it comes up with feathers\n     smeared in the blood.  The squawking has stopped.  Blood\n     splatters on Todd's shirt.  His eyes close.  \n\n     He stops the ball, looks around.  No one has seen him.  He \n     notices his shirt.  Calmly, he tears it off, wraps the ball in\n     it, and tosses it in a nearby trash can.  \n\n\n     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY\n\n     Todd pedals his bike through town, carrying a brown paper bag \n     under one arm.  He turns down Dussander's street.  He stops in\n     front of the house and heads for the front door.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Dussander emerges from the basement just as Todd comes into the\n     kitchen.  Todd sniffs the air, frowns.  \n\n                          TODD \n             What the fuck happened in here?\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Ah, boy...  I burned my TV dinner, I'm afraid.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Something's come up.  Sit down.  \n\n     Dussander's studies Todd for a moment.  Although Todd appears\n     calm, his tone reflects a somber, business-like attitude.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I see.  \n                    (sits at table) \n             What seems to be the trouble? \n\n     Todd sets his grade card and the envelope on the table.\n     Dussander picks up the grade card and examines it.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Quarterly Progress Report.\n                    (he reads silently) \n             You seem to have fallen on the rocks, my boy.\n             One B, three C's and a D.  Hardly the work of\n             a \"National Merit Scholar,\" or whatever you\n             call yourself.  \n\n                          TODD \n             This isn't a joke, Dussander.  I can't blame\n             this on teachers or honors classes anymore.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Looks like you have a problem then.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I have a problem?  You still don't get it.  \n             I'm out of excuses.  Do you know what's going\n             to happen when my dad sees that?  He's going \n             to hit the fucking roof.  He'll get it all\n             out of me.  The truth, you...everything.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, it's not my fault your grades have \n             fallen.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Don't be so sure.  \n\n     Dussander throws Todd a dismissive wave.  He gets up to get a drink \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Please, you don't spend that much time here.\n             I hardly think--\n\n                          TODD \n                    (quickly, as if confessing something) \n             I can't study anymore. \n\n     Pause.  Dussander looks at him oddly, a bit surprised.  But then\n     opens the cabinet and pulls out a glass, allowing Todd to continue.  \n\n                          TODD \n                    (with difficulty) \n             I try.  But it's...  different now.  I sit in \n             front of my books and start thinking about...\n             about corpses, and electrified fences and\n             people getting strangled with piano wire.  \n             All that crap you tell me.  The next thing I\n             know it's after midnight.  I sit in class \n             like a zombie, ...useless.  But that's not\n             the half of it.  Check out the letter.  \n\n     Dussander goes back to the table and picks up the envelope.  He\n     opens it.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (reading letter) \n             'Dear Mr. and Mrs. Bowden, this note is to\n             suggest that we have a group conference \n             concerning Todd's first semester grades.  In\n             light of his previous good work in this\n             school, the sudden deterioration in his\n             grades suggest a specific problem which\n             should be addressed before his academic \n             advancement is jeopardized permanently.  Such\n             a problem can often be solved by a frank and\n             open discussion.  I am ready to work out a \n             time for us to meet.  In a case such as this,\n             earlier is usually better.  Sincerely yours,\n             Edward French.'  Who is this Edward French,\n             the headmaster? \n\n                          TODD \n             French?  Fuck no.  He's a stupid guidance\n             counselor.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Guidance counselor?  What is that? \n\n                          TODD \n             He guides and he counsels.  You read the\n             fucking note.  Do you realize I could have to\n             go to summer school?  Me, in there with all\n             those fuck-ups.  I do not want to go to\n             summer school.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Or to the reformatory.  \n\n                          TODD\n             What did you say? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, ...you have a far greater problem than\n             your school grades.  Before you speak to me\n             about what they will \"get out of you\", \n             remember the facts. ...Seventy thousand \n             people died at Patin.  Have you forgotten \n             that?  To the world at large I am the most \n             despicable of criminals, a monster.  Do you \n             think I would stand aside and let you turn me\n             in so easily?  Without a fight?  Is your \n             American self-confidence so bloated that you \n             have never once realized you are an accessory \n             to my crimes.  You have criminal knowledge of \n             an illegal alien, and have not reported it. \n             Don't you see that?  And if I'm caught, I \n             will tell the world all about you.  When the \n             reporters put their microphones in my face it\n             will be your name I'll repeat over and over\n             again.  Todd Bowden, yes that's his name.  \n             How long?... oh, for months, almost a year.\n             He wanted to know everything...  That's how\n             he put it, yes - everything.  \n\n                          TODD \n             They'd never believe you.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Perhaps, perhaps not.  It's a gamble.  How\n             would you explain all those books you were\n             reading to me?  My eyes are not what they \n             were but I can still read fine print.  I can\n             prove it.\n\n                          TODD \n             So what? I'd say you tricked me.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Why would I do that?\n\n                          TODD\n             For friendship, because you're lonely and had\n             no one in your life.  No jury would take your\n             word over mine.  A Nazi?  Forget it.  Just \n             get it out of your head.  You can't threaten\n             me and you can't scare me.  What you can do\n             is find me a pencil.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             A pencil, what for? \n\n     Todd sets the small paper bag on the table.  Dussander opens it\n     and removes a small bottle.  The label reads: \"ink eradicator.\"\n     He also removes an x-acto knife and a few sheets of rub-off\n     letters.  \n\n                          TODD \n             That will take care of the report card, I \n             think.  About that fucking letter, I don't\n             know.  \n\n     Todd sits down at the table.  He takes the bottle from Dussander\n     and examines the report card.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Fuck...  come on, a pencil.  A sharp one.  \n             With an eraser.  \n\n     Dussander pauses.  He knows Todd is right.  Slowly, he goes to \n     the counter and opens a drawer.  He rummages through it as Todd \n     sits with his back to him.  Dussander picks out a pencil with an\n     extremely sharp point.  He holds it point out and approaches\n     Todd.  He gets closer, the point moves in toward the back of \n     Todd's head.  He holds the point inches from the boy's neck.  He\n     deliberates.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Will this do? \n\n     Todd grabs the pencil.  Dussander turns toward the window.  He\n     thinks for a moment.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             Tell me, does this French know your parents\n             in a social way? \n\n                          TODD \n             Him?  Fuck, no.  They wouldn't mix with a\n             geek like him.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             How about professionally?  Has he ever called\n             them before? \n\n                          TODD \n             No.  I've never needed it.  Why? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I have an idea.  It will require you to make\n             one phone call.  \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY\n\n     Kurt Dussander, a.k.a. Arthur Denker, a.k.a. Victor Bowden,\n     Todd's grandfather, sits outside an office marked, \"Edward\n     French - Guidance.\"  Dussander looks the best he has ever \n     looked.  His hair is clean and combed.  His face is shaved.  And\n     he is smartly dressed in his best blue suit.  As he waits, he\n     glances down at a piece of paper.  We see that it is a \"crib-\n     sheet\" of Todd's family tree.  Several names appear on the \n     sheet, connected to other names by lines and arrows.  By each\n     name is one or two word description, such as \"dead: cancer,\n     1981\" or \"divorced, Dallas, Tex.\"  The door opens up.  Dussander\n     pockets the note.  EDWARD FRENCH, 40's, stands in the doorway.\n     He wears a turtle neck under his sportcoat.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Mr. Bowden?\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Mr. French, a pleasure.  \n\n     There is a bit of hesitation on French's part, but they shake \n     hands.  Dussander notices the shoes on French's feet, bright red\n     converse high-tops.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             My, those are some... colorful shoes.  \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRENCH'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     French makes his way around his desk.  Dussander stands by the\n     door.\n\n                          FRENCH \n             To you, sir, I'm sure they seem quite out of \n             the ordinary.  But when it is your job to get \n             confused sixteen year-olds to open up to you,\n             you take whatever steps you need.  Please\n             have a seat.  \n\n     They both sit.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             And the shoes work? \n\n                          FRENCH \n             They seem to help, believe it or not.  Well,\n             I thank you for coming down, Mr.  Bowden, but\n             I'll be frank with you...  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Yes, please do.\n\n                          FRENCH \n             The fact that you're here and not Todd's\n             parents tells me a great deal.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I'm sure.  My son and his wife asked me to \n             come in and discuss this sorry business with \n             you, Mr.  French.  Todd is a good boy, believe\n             me.  This trouble with his grades is only\n             temporary.  \n\n     Dussander pulls out his cigarettes and then, thinking twice,\n     puts them back.\n\n                          FRENCH \n             It's all right.\n                    (pulls an ashtray from desk\n                    drawer) \n             There's no smoking on school grounds, but if \n             it will make you more comfortable, I'll never\n             tell.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             A terrible habit, but thank you.\n                    (lights up) \n             I suppose I should begin by informing you \n             that my son and my daughter-in-law are having\n             troubles at home.  Rather bad troubles, I\n             should think.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I appreciate your candor.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (leaning in)\n             The mother drinks.\n\n                          FRENCH\n             Oh.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes.  The boy has told me that he has come\n             home on two occasions and has found her \n             sprawled out on the kitchen table.  He knows \n             how my son feels about her drinking and so on\n             these occasions he has put dinner in the oven\n             himself and forced enough black coffee down \n             his mother's throat so that she will at least\n             be awake when Richard gets home.\n\n                          FRENCH\n             That's bad.  Has Mrs. Bowden thought about\n             getting professional help for her problem? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             The boy has tried to persuade her, but she is\n             far too ashamed, I think.  If she was given a\n             little time...  You understand? \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Of course.  Your son... Todd's father...\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             He is not without blame, believe me.  The\n             hours he works.  The meals he has missed.  \n             They take a toll on a family.  I was raised\n             to believe that a man's family came before \n             his work or anything else.  I tried to teach\n             my son that... but --\n\n                          FRENCH \n             There's only so much we can teach our kids, \n             Mr. Bowden.  ...What about Monica's mother or\n             father?  Couldn't they talk to her? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Her mother, Sabrina, lives in a nursing home\n             in Florida.  I'm afraid after her husband\n             died she lost her will to live.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Probably not the best person for Monica to\n             speak to.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Indeed.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Mr. Bowden, I don't have to remind you, I'm \n             sure, of Todd's stellar academic record.\n             National Merit Scholar finalist, Academic\n             All-Stars.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes.  I keep his certificates on the wall of\n             my store.  I run a small bookstore in San\n             Remo.  \n\n     A hint of skepticism crosses French's eyes.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n                    (glancing at folder on desk) \n             Yes, I see that.  Anyway, Todd is, and I hate\n             to phrase it this way, but he's one of the \n             ones worth fighting for.  He's a special kid,\n             we both know that.  But If Todd's grades\n             don't improve drastically and quickly...\n             he'll be opening a real nasty can of worms.\n             Summer school would just be the beginning.  \n             His whole college acceptance schedule would\n             be thrown way off course.  The good schools\n             won't know what to make of him.  I'm sure\n             he'd hate that and so would you.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Of course.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             So let's get to the bottom line, shall we? \n             What I'm proposing is some family counselling\n             at the Counselling Center downtown.\n             Everything is in confidence, of course.  A\n             man in charge down there, Harry Shumacher, is \n             a good friend of mine.  I think Todd and his \n             parents should go see him together.  It might\n             be difficult for Todd to go to his parents \n             with this; I think you should do it.  Maybe\n             we can get everybody on track by the end of \n             the next quarter.  It will be tough, but not\n             impossible.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I'm not sure that would be the best thing for\n             the boy.  The parents might resent him if I\n             took them that proposal right now.  Things\n             are very delicate.  To swing the scale too \n             far in the wrong direction might cause more \n             harm than good.  The boy has promised to work\n             harder in his studies.  He is most concerned\n             by the drop in his grades, more alarmed than\n             you might expect.  He has his mind set on \n             attending Stanford or Berkeley next fall and\n             does not wish to see his plans altered.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             Yes, well -- \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Also, the parents would resent me.  Monica\n             already thinks I meddle too much in her\n             affairs.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I have a great deal of experience in these \n             matters, Mr. Bowden.  And please understand\n             that my interest in your son's marital \n             problems begins and ends with the effect they\n             are having on Todd.  And right now I think \n             they are having quite an effect.  I really\n             think counselling is in order here.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Allow me to make a counter proposal.  You \n             have, I believe, a system for warning parents\n             of poor grades? \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Yes, Interpretation of Progress cards.  IOP\n             cards.  The kids call them flunk card.  They\n             only get them when their grades in a class \n             fall below the seventy percent.  That means a\n             \"D\" or an \"F\".  Why? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             And they are sent out when? \n\n                          FRENCH\n             Mid-quarter.  That's about three weeks into\n             the new marking period.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Allowing for Christmas break, the next time\n             they are sent out will be in late January,\n             correct?\n\n                          FRENCH\n             Yes, that's right.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Good.  Then what I suggest is this...  \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY\n\n     Dussander still wears the blue suit.  The tie has been loosened\n     and top button undone.  Todd still wears his backpack.\n\n                          TODD\n             You what? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I told him you were getting back on track by\n             your own accord.  I gave him my word.  If you\n             get even one flunk card--\n\n                          TODD \n             Are you out of your fucking mind?  I'm going\n             to get three or four flunk cards.  I failed\n             an economics test today, so there's another\n             one. \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, it was the best I could do without\n             arousing suspicion.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I could have done better myself --\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Well you didn't, did you?  This is the way it\n             is and now you are upset because the only way\n             you can make things right is to work.\n\n                          TODD \n             You're insane.  I'm upset because it can't be done.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It can.  And it will.  You will work.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't take orders from you.  Maybe you've\n             forgotten --\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n                    (turning on him) \n             Listen, boy.  Before today it was possible,\n             just barely possible, that you could have\n             denounced me and come out clean yourself.  \n             The way your nerves have been lately I don't\n             think so, but never mind that.  It was - at\n             least technically possible.  But now things\n             have changed.  Today I impersonated your \n             grandfather, one Victor Bowden.  And it was\n             you who arranged the meeting.  What would\n             people make of that?  If things come out \n             now... perhaps you were right, your age and a\n             good attorney might keep you out of jail, but\n             you would be humiliated, boy, publicly.  You \n             would be infamous.  Your parents too.  Do you \n             know what such a scandal would do to them?\n             To you?  Think about that.  \n\n     Todd is stunned.  He turns away, then back again, struggling for\n     the right words.  \n\n                          TODD\n             You fucker.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It's a done deal, boy.  If you don't like it,\n             you can discuss it at family counselling.  \n\n                          TODD \n             God!  I wish... I wish -- \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Never mind your wishes.  Your wishes make me\n             sick.  All I want to hear is that you\n             understand the situation.  \n\n     Todd is furious.  He sees there is no other way, but continues\n     fighting.\n\n                          TODD \n             Look, you gotta believe me.  There is no way\n             in hell that I can pull myself out of a half\n             year slide in a couple of weeks.  I wish I \n             could, but we're just going to have to think\n             of something else.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Boy, the time for discussion is over.  This\n             is the way it is.  You are going to work.\n             And I am going to be right here with you.  \n\n                          TODD \n             What are you talking about? \n\n\n     EXT. BIKE PATH - DAY\n\n     Todd is standing with his bike on a dirt path.  He is looking\n     out at something.  The wind blows throw his hair.  A distant\n     glimpse of some buildings off to the side tell us he is on a\n     hill.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (V.O.) \n             You are going to spend the rest of this \n             quarter, all of your vacation and the first \n             three weeks of January studying.  During your\n             free period you will study.  During lunch,\n             you will study.  And after school and on \n             weekends you will come here and do the same.\n\n\n     EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DAY\n\n     Todd pedals his bike furiously toward the camera.  He approaches\n     a tunnel lined with corrugated metal below an overpass.\n\n                          TODD (V.O.)\n             Not here, at home.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (V.O.)\n             No.  At home you will dawdle, you will talk\n             on the telephone, watch TV.  Here, I can make\n             sure that nothing distracts you from your\n             studies.\n\n     Todd emerges from the tunnel.  \n\n\n     DUSSANDER'S DREAM #3: EXT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT\n\n     Spotlights, like those from a guard tower, criss cross over a \n     small compound surrounded by an electrified fence.  Inside the \n     pen, wolf-like dogs snarl and gnash their teeth.  The spotlight\n     catches the source of their aggravation...  \n\n     Dussander, caught ghoulishly in the roving light, stands in \n     uniform outside the pen.  He is laughing.  In his hand is his\n     Luger.  He fires through the fence, killing one of the dogs.\n     They go wild.  He laughs harder.  He shoots again, and then\n     again.  It is like shooting fish in a barrel.  \n\n     The light beam passes the pen to reveal that the dogs have \n     transformed into human prisoners.  They maneuver helplessly to\n     avoid Dussander's bullets.  But he fires faster, his laugh \n     growing more extreme.  His movements in between shots becomes a \n     sort of dance.  One prisoner flies against the fence in a pools\n     of sparks.  As Dussander's waltz reaches it's climax, one \n     prisoner remains in the pen.  He looks up.  It is Todd.  Angle\n     on Dussander's toothy grin.  The gun comes up...  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - IMMEDIATELY AFTER\n\n     Dussander wakes up.  A CLANKING SOUND echoes from the street.\n     Dussander looks like he could have been having a wonderful sex \n     dream, but he turns his head toward the direction of the street.\n     He clicks on the light.  Dressed in the SS uniform, he gets up\n     and moves toward the window.  \n\n     Through the window, bathed in the glow of a street lamp, a\n     derelict, who we will come to know as ARCHIE, rummages through\n     Dussander's trashcans.  Under his arm are a few of the empty \n     bourbon bottles.  \n\n\n     INT. BECKY'S TOYOTA - NIGHT\n\n     The car pulls into the driveway of Todd's house.  Becky is\n     smoking a joint and blowing the smoke out the window.  They both\n     look a little tipsy, as if they have been to a party.  She holds \n     the joint up to Todd.  He contemplates, then takes it.  Todd's\n     first toke of marijuana isn't very small.  Becky looks on, \n     surprised.  She reaches out for the joint and Todd waves her \n     off.  He pulls again, this time ingesting a huge hit.  He holds \n     it, then exhales.  He gives the roach back to Becky.\n\n                          TODD \n             Their light is still on.  I'll get out on\n             your side.  Don't say anything.\n\n     Becky gets out.  Todd slides over and does the same.  She \n     crushes the joint out on the pavement and puts the rest in her\n     purse.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander watches Archie collect the cans and bottles.  There is\n     something about Archie that makes Dussander wonder if he has\n     seen him before.  Archie looks up, right into Dussander's \n     window, as if he were expecting him to be there.  The two stare\n     at one another for a long moment.  Suddenly Dussander is aware\n     that he is dressed in the SS uniform.  \n\n     He quickly steps back from the window.  His breathing is short \n     and erratic as he waits in the shadows for Archie to finish.  \n     After a long moment, the noise from the street stops.  We hear\n     only the faint steps of Archie walking away.  \n\n\n     INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Todd and Becky's lips are locked in a passionate kiss. In their\n     exuberance they fall onto the bed.  As they try to undress and\n     kiss at the same time, Becky begins to moan.  Todd brings his\n     fingers to his lips.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Shhh.  \n\n     Their clothes tumble off around them.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Don't move.  \n\n     He slides off her and opens the drawer by his bed.  He pulls out\n     a condom.  By now she is naked.  Todd slips out of his underwear\n     and falls on top of her.  The RADIO plays in the b.g. as Todd\n     begins to grind away with his hips.  She moans softly with \n     delight.\n\n     The CAMERA MOVES off of them to reveal a man in a lab coat \n     setting up a volt meter.  This is one of the scientists from \n     Todd's laboratory nightmare.  The CAMERA continues TO PAN across\n     the bedroom, showing the other scientists preparing for the \n     electricity experiment.  The CAMERA STOPS on Dussander,\n     clipboard in hand, observing everything carefully.  \n\n     Todd releases with a final thrust.  Becky is MOANING in a series\n     of high, fast yelps.  Todd lies still on her body.  Becky is\n     speechless, still quivering from the unusually intense love\n     making.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The bedroom is dark except for the glowing tip of a cigarette.\n     Dussander is in bed, wide awake...  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     TITLE: JANUARY 1985 \n\n     Todd sits alone at the table, eating while he studies.  \n     Dussander crosses the frame behind him, drink in hand.  Todd is\n     noticeably annoyed by Dussander's presence.\n\n\n     EXT. BIKE PATH - TUNNEL - DUSK\n\n     It is raining.  Todd is riding fast.  He wears a raincoat with \n     the hood up.  He talks to himself loudly, but we can't make out\n     what he is saying.  He enters the tunnel.  \n\n     The muddy run-off inside the tunnel catches Todd by surprise.\n     He loses control of the bike and falls into the mud.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Fuck.  \n\n     Todd gets up and tries to free his bike, but the mud and water\n     do not make the job easy.  He is almost finished when a gruff\n     voice catches his attention.  \n\n                          ARCHIE (O.S.) \n             Hey, kid, you having some trouble? \n\n     Todd looks up and sees a figure moving toward him in the shadows\n     of the tunnel. Todd quickly pulls out a pocket knife.  He flicks\n     open the blade and hides it behind his leg.  \n\n                          TODD \n             No.  I got it... thanks.  \n\n     The figure steps closer.  The light catches his face to reveal\n     Archie.  He is an unshaven, filthy mess, and when he speaks his\n     words are slurred from years of steady drinking.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             That case maybe you could loan me a dollar.\n             Help out a Vietnam vet? How 'bout it? \n\n     Todd eyes the man cautiously.  He looks around.  No one is \n     nearby.  The constant din of the rain echoes within the confines\n     of the tunnel.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I... I don't know... I don't think so.  \n\n     Todd palms the knife out of sight and slowly approaches the bum.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             C'mon, you got something for me.  I know you\n             do.\n\n                          TODD\n             Well, maybe... I have to check.  \n\n     Todd's hands go into his pockets.  He stops a few feet from the\n     bum.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             See, I got to get up to L.A.  Got a job\n             waiting for me up there.  \n\n     Todd moves closer.  Close enough to touch the bum.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I thought I did have a couple of quarters...\n\n     The bum looks at him hopefully. Todd looks back at him, sizing\n     him up, really noticing him for the first time.  \n\n                          ARCHIE\n             You know, \n                    (his voice drops) \n             For a dollar I'll give you a blow job.  Take \n             you right up there where it's still dry.  You\n             never had so good, kid.  You'll come your\n             brains out.  \n\n     Todd freezes for a moment.  The bum is right in his face.  \n     Suddenly Todd throws a handful of change at the bum and sprints\n     back to his bike.  He hops on and is gone in a flash, leaving\n     the bum there to pick up the scattered coins.  \n\n     As Todd zips away, the hood is off his head.  The rain begins to\n     beat away the splattered mud from his face.\n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HISTORY CLASS - DAY\n\n     Mr. Proxmire makes his way through the rows of desks.  He is\n     passing out papers.  \n\n                          PROXMIRE \n             Our illustrious administration, in its quest\n             to make my job as difficult as possible, has\n             decided that home room teachers are now \n             responsible for handing IOP cards for all \n             your classes.  So for those of you getting\n             flunk cards, you'll find them attached to\n             last week's exam.  \n\n     Moans erupt from the class.  Todd sits motionless at his desk.\n     The moment of truth.  Proxmire passes him and places the exam\n     face down on Todd's desk.  Todd hesitates before turning it\n     over.  He is sweating.  \n\n     He flips the paper over and glares at the small card clipped to\n     the top of the paper.  He picks up the card and reads it: \"I'm\n     sure glad I didn't have to give you one of these for real!\n     Great improvement, Todd. -- Anne Leland.\"  Todd cannot contain \n     his delight.  Nearby students stare curiously at the strange boy\n     beaming over his flunk card.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Dussander sits at the table.  He holds the IOP card out at arm's\n     length to read it.  The bourbon bottle next to him is empty.\n     Todd sits across from him.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Well, this calls for a celebration, no? \n\n     Dussander gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Look, I guess I owe a lot of this to you.\n             I'm not proud of it, but it's true.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (eyeing him cautiously)\n             Your gratitude humbles me.\n                    (pause) \n             How about some Ritz crackers and Velveeta?\n\n                          TODD \n             Sure, what the hell.  \n\n     Dussander goes about his task, taking items from the cabinets, \n     etc.  Todd watches all of this intently, but without expression.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I would have expected you to be doing back \n             flips down the hallway after such good news.\n             You are so quiet.  \n\n     Todd does not respond.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             Today, I think, I give you the day off from\n             studying.  How's that?  How about one of my\n             stories instead?  I still have a few good\n             ones saved up.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't care.  Whatever you want.  \n\n     Todd is wringing his hand together nervously under the table.\n     Dussander places a box of crackers on the table and goes back to\n     the counter.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Let's see.  I could tell you about the \n             special soap we made.  Or there is always the\n             story of how I escaped from Berlin after I\n             was foolish enough to go back.  That was a\n             close one, I promise you.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Anything, really.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             No, none of these I think.  You don't seem to\n             be in the mood.  \n\n     Dussander slices open a pack of Velveeta and puts it on a plate.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             I think today I will tell you the story of an\n             old man who was afraid.  He was afraid of a\n             certain young boy who was, in a queer way, \n             his friend.  The boy proved to be a very good\n             student, but perhaps not in the way his \n             mother or his teachers had envisioned.  At \n             first the old man disliked the boy intensely,\n             but then he grew to... to enjoy the boy's \n             company.  Of course, there was still a great\n             deal of distrust between them.\n\n     He puts a glass of Coke in front of Todd and goes back to the\n     counter.  He opens a drawer, takes something out, closes it.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Each knew something that other wanted to keep\n             secret.  But over time, the old man began to\n             feel that things were changing.  He felt his\n             hold on the boy slipping away from him.  \n\n     Dussander goes to the cellar door.  His back is to Todd.  He\n     opens the door and clicks on the light.  Todd stands up\n     silently.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             So.  One sleepless night the old man got out\n             of bed and wrote down the story of his \n             involvement with the boy.  Everything he \n             could remember, from the first day forward.  \n\n     Todd has moved across the floor, careful not to let the floor \n     creak under his steps.  He is right upon Dussander.  Dussander\n     reaches out with one arm for a fresh bottle, grasping onto the\n     railing with the other.  His body hangs over the steep\n     staircase.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             When he finished his hand was stinging from \n             arthritis but he felt good for the first time\n             in weeks.  He felt safe.\n\n     He gets his balance again and turns to face Todd.  Dussander\n     holds the kitchen knife he was using earlier down at his side \n     where Todd can see it.  A tense silence passes between them.\n\n     Todd is frozen.  Dussander steps past him and back into the \n     kitchen.  He closes the cellar door behind him. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             He climbed back into bed and slept until it\n             was time for General Hospital.  \n\n     Dussander sits back in his chair, cutting the seal on the fresh\n     bottle. \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             On the following day the old man put on his\n             best suit and went down to one of the local\n             banks and rented a safety deposit box.  The \n             bank officer explained to the old man that he\n             would have a key and the bank would have a\n             key.  To open the box both keys would be \n             needed.  No one but the old man could use the\n             old man's key without a signed, notarized\n             letter of permission from the old man \n             himself.  With one exception.\n\n     Todd sinks into a chair across from Dussander and takes a sip of\n     Coke.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             That exception is made in the event of the\n             box-holder's death.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Then what? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Then the box is opened in the presence of a\n             bank official and a representative of the \n             Internal Revenue Service.  The contents of \n             the box are inventoried.  In this case they \n             will find only a twelve-page document.  Non-\n             taxable... but highly interesting.  \n\n     Todd understands what the old man has told him.  He slams his\n     glass down on the table and jumps out of his chair.  \n\n                          TODD\n             You can't... you can't do that.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My boy, it is already done.  \n\n                          TODD \n             But... Christ!  Look at you.  You could go at\n             any time.  \n\n     Todd stares at Dussander in disbelief.  After a moment he storms\n     out the back door to the porch.  \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S BACK PORCH - DAY\n\n     Todd is leaning over the rail looking out at the yard when\n     Dussander steps onto the porch.  He carries with him the bottle\n     of bourbon and a glass.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Then there is nothing for me.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             But there is.  As the years go by, as I get\n             closer to the grave, your hold on me will \n             become worth less and less.  A man five, ten\n             years older than I worries more about his \n             ailing heart than being extradited to Israel.\n             And there will come a day - if I live long\n             enough - when I decide what you know no \n             longer matters.  Then, and only then, I will\n             destroy my document.  \n\n                          TODD \n             But... but so many things can happen to you \n             in between.  Accidents.  Sickness.  You could\n             slip in the shower, for Christ's sake...  \n\n     Dussander shrugs and lights another cigarette.  He begins to\n     sing softly, then gets caught up in the song...  Todd turns away, angry.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Que sera, sera...  Whatever will be, will\n             be... The future's not ours to see... Que\n             sera, sera...  \n\n     Pause.  Dussander sees he has pressed Todd's button.  He moves\n     closer.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             My dear boy, I see you thinking about it, \n             even now.  It is in your eyes.  Killing me.\n             It would take only a flick of a knife.  Or\n             maybe push me down the steps, make it look \n             like an accident?  I am old.  You are strong.\n             You are angry.  Good assets for killing.  But\n             there is something missing...  \n\n     Dussander speaks with a near whisper in Todd's ear.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             To have some one in your control.  To have\n             them know that they are alive because you\n             have not decided to the contrary.  Do you\n             have that power?  Ask yourself.  It is no\n             easy question.  I think you know that.  \n\n     There is a long pregnant pause.  Then Todd lets out a sigh, as if\n     to dismiss what he has just heard.  He turns to face Dussander.  \n\n                          TODD \n             You know this means we're through.  You won't\n             be seeing me around here anymore.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             No, I suppose I won't.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I'm never coming here again.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             And so it comes to an end.  Here.\n\n     Dussander pours a splash of bourbon into the boy's glass.  \n\n                          TODD \n             What are you doing? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             A drink.  To our lives together, the\n             beginning... and the end.  \n\n     Todd picks up his glass.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I think you should fuck yourself.  \n\n     He CLICKS his glass against Dussander's.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My boy, don't you see that we are fucking\n             each other? \n\n     He drinks.  Todd, reluctantly, does the same.\n\n                                                        FADE TO BLACK.\n\n\n     EXT. MAIN STREET - SANTO DONATO - DAY\n\n     TITLE:  APRIL 1985 \n\n     Dussander, dressed smartly for a day out of the house, emerges\n     from a matinee at the movie theater and strolls down the \n     sidewalk, the umbrella under his arm.  He stops at an empty bench \n     and sits to wait for the bus.  \n\n     Archie sits down next to him.  At first Dussander doesn't pay\n     attention to him, but Archie's behavior tells us that he is \n     keenly aware of Dussander's presence.  Dussander stares out into\n     the street, but Archie fidgets about, his eyes roaming, and \n     finally slides a little closer to Dussander.  Dussander looks at\n     him flatly.  Archie grins.  Dussander turns away, prepared to\n     dismiss this odd behavior as that of a crazed derelict.  Then\n     Archie speaks...\n\n                          ARCHIE \n                    (leaning over) \n             I notice the kid don't come around no more.  \n\n     Dussander doesn't respond.  He catches Archie in a glance and\n     sees that he is staring at him.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             What?\n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Little blond-hair boy. ...What's the matter,\n             you ain't his friend no more? \n\n     Dussander is like stone, flashing the eyes of a man who is not\n     to be harassed.  Finally...  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You mistake me for somebody else. ...Pardon\n             me, my bus is coming.  \n\n     Dussander stands, slightly rattled only to those who know him\n     well.  He looks down the street for the bus.  Archie doesn't \n     move.  Rather, he inspects Dussander from head to toe, stopping\n     on the shoes.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Damn... Cuban high heels.  Nice ones, too. \n\n     The SQUEAL of brakes grows louder as the bus comes to rest in \n     front of Dussander.  He has become perceptibly more nervous as\n     he waits for the passengers to exit.  He climbs up the first\n     step.\n\n                          ARCHIE \n             I ain't seen a pair like that since I was in\n             Havana.  \n                    (talking louder because of the \n                    bus) \n             That's the only place you can get'em.  Can't\n             get'em exported... Government don't let you.  \n\n     The door closes behind Dussander. The bus pulls away. Through\n     the window of the bus Dussander watches Archie as he continues\n     his speech to no one.  \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY\n\n     TITLE: MAY 1985 \n\n     Todd sits nervously in a chair next to a tough, leather-clad \n     trouble maker.  A SECRETARY sits behind a long desk.  Her phone\n     beeps and she picks it up.  \n\n                          SECRETARY \n             Go in, Todd.  They're waiting for you.  \n\n     Todd approaches a door marked: \"Dr. Carl N. Morgan - Principal.\"\n     He goes in.  \n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Todd opens the office door.  As his eyes scan the floor he\n     notices a familiar pair of yellow high-tops.  He looks up to see\n     Ed French leaning against the wall.  Seated at the desk is\n     MORGAN, a thin, stern man, around 50.  Todd's face shows a\n     moment of trepidation, but he regains his composure almost\n     instantly.\n\n                          MORGAN\n             Have a seat, Todd.  \n\n     Todd does as Morgan pours over Todd's files.  \n\n                          MORGAN (CONT'D) \n             I see from your record and from what Mr.  \n             French tells me that after a minor slip up\n             last semester you're right back on course.\n             Straight A's for the quarter so far.  And I \n             hear your little slip didn't bother the folks\n             up at Stanford too much either.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             A good break for you, Todd.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Looks like that little talk with your...\n                    (looks at file) \n             grandfather... really helped.  Well, we don't\n             want to keep you too long.  \n                    (to French)\n             You tell him.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Well, it seems Sally Chong didn't do to well\n             in A.P. biology.\n\n                          MORGAN\n             She failed it.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I'm afraid so.  She refused to take part in \n             the fetal pig dissection.  The teacher begged\n             her to drop the class, but Sally thought she\n             could pass anyway.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Stubborn girl... What we're telling you, son,\n             is that because Sally Chang -\n\n                          FRENCH\n             Chong.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Because Sally Chong wouldn't hack up a baby \n             pig, you snuck by her in the rankings.  So if\n             you can keep your grades up for two more\n             months -- any reason that shouldn't happen? \n\n                          TODD\n             No.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Then you'll make valedictorian, Todd.\n             Congratulations.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Congratulations, Todd.  \n\n     French shakes Todd's hand, an uneasy moment passes between the\n     two of them.\n\n\n     INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Todd comes out of Morgan's office.  French follows him.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Todd, you really should be proud of yourself.\n             To tell you the truth, I'm amazed you pulled \n             it off.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Thanks, I guess.  \n\n     He starts to walk away.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I was glad to hear you made varsity baseball.\n             I spoke to the coach.  He says your coming\n             along real well.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Thanks.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             It's turning out to be a good year for you.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah.  \n\n     He turns to go, but French stops him again.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             Todd, wait.  \n\n     He steps up to Todd and lowers his voice, as if he were hedging\n     a touchy subject.\n\n                          FRENCH (CONT'D) \n             Todd, you've got a lot of good things going\n             on right now.  You should be enjoying\n             yourself.  \n\n                          TODD\n             I am.  \n\n     French's looks says, \"No, you're not.\" \n\n                          FRENCH \n             How are things at home? \n\n     Todd realizes he is not going to get out of this easily.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Look, things with my parents were bad for a\n             while.  But they're doing a lot better.  \n             Thanks for your concern, really.  I should\n             get back to class.  \n\n     He is pulling away from French as he speaks.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n                    (unconvinced) \n             Okay, Todd.  I know this isn't the place to\n             talk about this.  But my door is always open...\n\n                          TODD\n             I know.  Thanks.  \n\n     Todd walks away.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             And it's going to stay open.  \n\n     But Todd does not turn around.  French stares after him.  The\n     BELL RINGS, and Todd is swallowed by the stream of students\n     emerging from the class rooms.  \n\n\n     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY\n\n     Todd is kneeling down at the bike rack.  His backpack is on the\n     ground next to him.  He unlocks his bike and begins to coil the\n     chain around his wrist when Joey walks by.  He sees Todd and\n     considers going by, but stops.  We can tell they haven't spoken\n     in a while.  \n\n                          JOEY\n             Hey there.  \n\n     Todd looks up.  He seems pleasant, but there is little warmth in\n     his voice.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Hey.  \n\n     Pause.  They look at each other.  Joey wants to talk.  Todd\n     slips the chain lock into a pocket on his backpack.  Joey\n     jingles his car keys anxiously.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             I... ah, I heard about Stanford.  I heard a\n             couple of weeks ago actually. ...Congrats.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Thanks.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             I got into school to.  Long Beach.  It's no\n             Stanford, but...  \n\n     Joey shrugs.  It's an awkward moment.  He walks closer.  \n\n                          TODD \n             No, no... that's good, Joe.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             Well, ...I just wanted to say hi.  Here let\n             me get that.  \n\n     Joey reaches for Todd's backpack.  He lifts it.  The heaviness\n     puzzles him.  Todd takes it from him.  \n\n                          JOEY (CONT'D) \n             What do you have in there? \n\n     Todd stares at him stone-faced.  Joey doesn't like Todd's\n     expression.  Todd takes the bag from him and puts it on.  \n\n                          TODD\n             You busy now? \n\n                          JOEY\n             Uhh...  \n\n                          TODD \n             Come with me.  Hop on.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             Hop on?  I have a car now, Todd.  \n\n                          TODD \n             You can't drive where we're going.  \n\n\n     EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY\n\n     Joey sits on the handle bars as Todd pedals over the rugged\n     terrain.  Joy looks scared, but appears to be enjoying the ride \n     and the chance to be with his old friend.  \n\n     The next shot shows Todd's bike laying on the ground.  The\n     wheels still turn slowly.  The camera moves to reveal Todd and\n     Joey standing on a rocky ledge.  Orange Country sprawls out\n     before them.  \n\n     Under the cross-hairs of a telescopic sight, a truck, from the\n     freeway below, zooms out of frame.  The image vanishes.  We see\n     Joey looking through the scope which he holds in one hand.  \n\n                          JOEY\n             This is so cool.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Point it over here.  That's the middle \n             school.  You can see right into our old class\n             room.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             Oh yeah... But I still don't see what you \n             need the rest of it for.  Doesn't your Dad\n             notice? \n\n     The hunting rifle, disassembled, sticks out of Todd's backpack\n     on the ground.  \n\n                          TODD \n             He hasn't yet.  \n\n                          JOEY \n             Yet?... Jesus, Todd.  \n\n     He is trying to joke, but the seriousness is clearly in his\n     voice.  \n\n                          TODD \n             And over here, that's your dad's office.  And\n             there's the old drive-in.  \n\n     Joey isn't looking through the scope anymore.  He holds it out\n     to Todd, watching him.  \n\n                          JOEY\n             Here.  Take it.  \n\n     Todd grabs the scope.  But Joey doesn't let go.  He finally\n     locks Todd in a stare that he has been avoiding for months.  He\n     wants to say something.  Todd takes the scope.  He sees that \n     Joey is serious.  He takes a few steps toward the edge, toward\n     the gun.  He looks out.  \n\n                          TODD \n             It's such a rush, you know?... To be up here.\n             Don't you feel it?  So high above them they\n             never know we're here.  It's like an ant \n             farm.  We're the gods on Mt. Olympus, Joey.\n             They can't see us, they can't hear us, but\n             every so often we can make them feel us.\n             Just so they never forget.  Look...  \n\n     He looks through the scope at the freeway.  He picks out passing\n     cars.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             There goes a future track star.  There goes a\n             judge.  A mom and her two kids.  A policeman.\n             That one's a school teacher, that one's a\n             drug dealer... You see, Joey, it doesn't \n             matter.  It doesn't matter how smart you are\n             ...or how many grades you skip.  There's \n             always someone who can take it all away.  The\n             right person snaps their fingers... and it's\n             done.  \n\n     Joey takes a few steps backward.  Todd doesn't notice.\n\n                          JOEY \n             Todd, I'm gonna go.  I'm gonna... walk home.  \n\n     Todd turns his head toward Joey, but it is as though no one is \n     there.  He looks away again.\n\n                          JOEY (CONT'D)\n             Todd...\n\n     Pause.  Todd looks again.  But this time Joey is really gone.  A\n     slight chuckle escapes Todd's mouth.  \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S STREET - EVENING\n\n     TITLE: JUNE 1985\n\n     Dussander plods down the sidewalk with his sacks of groceries.  \n     He is a little more winded, moves a little slower than\n     previously.\n\n     Suddenly Archie emerges from behind a group of trees.  He moves\n     quickly up to Dussander, catching him off guard.  \n\n                          ARCHIE\n             I can do that.  I can help you carry those.  \n\n     Dussander jumps back.  Archie stops.  \n\n                          ARCHIE (CONT'D) \n             You don't gotta be afraid.  I can carry those.\n\n     Dussander does not move.  But slowly his face changes and we\n     realize that he remembers Archie from the bus stop.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I don't need any help. ...Excuse me.  \n\n     He starts off again.  Archie follows.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Hey, I ain't a bad guy.  You don't gotta\n             worry.  I'm a veteran.  I just want--\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n                    (snapping at him) \n             What?  What do you want?  Why do you bother me? \n\n     Archie is taken aback by the sudden viciousness.  \n\n                          ARCHIE\n                    (plaintively)\n             You got a nice face.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             No I don't.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Look, we're practically neighbors.  I stay\n             right over there most nights.  \n                    (pointing across the street) \n             I see you walking down the street.  I come up\n             to help.  It's called being neighborly.\n\n     They are nearing Dussander's yard.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Piss off.  \n\n     Fed up with his belligerence, Archie strips the bags from\n     Dussander's hands with ease.  Dussander knows he is outmatched.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Ain't no reason to be rude.  You see, I know\n             something about you. ...I know your a nice\n             guy.  I'm nice too, ...just like the kid.  \n\n     Dussander looks up and down the street.  No one is around.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I see.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             And I know you got some bourbon in these \n             bags.  I ain't ashamed to say I could use a \n             drink about now.  But I don't need no charity.\n             If you want to invite me in, like a friend,\n             we could have a nice drink.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             A drink.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             That's what I'm saying.  \n\n     Long pause.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You smell like a toilet.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Maybe you let me use your shower.  But first \n             a drink.  After that I'll do anything you say.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n\n     Dussander and Archie come through the front door.  Archie scans\n     the room.\n\n                          ARCHIE\n             Yeah, this is nice.  Real nice.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Let me take those.  \n                    (takes the bags)\n             Right this way.  \n\n     Dussander moves toward the kitchen.  Archie watches him walk\n     away.  A smile crosses his face as he follows him to the kitchen.\n\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - EVENING\n\n     Todd and his parents are together in the living room.  Todd is\n     studying for his trigonometry final.  Monica sits at the couch\n     addressing graduation announcements.  Dick is at his desk,\n     pouring over a pile of receipts.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             I guess your parents don't need a graduation \n             announcement.\n\n                          DICK\n             No.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Grandma and Grandpa aren't coming?\n\n                          MONICA\n                    (to Dick) \n             I thought you told him.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Christ, I forgot.  Todd, my aunt Patty, Dad's\n             sister, died on Wednesday.  Mom and Dad have\n             to drive up to Fresno to settle her estate.  \n             We can't ask Dad to drive six hours each way\n             for graduation.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             If we ask them, they'll do it.  \n\n                          DICK \n             That's why.  You understand, don't you, Todd? \n\n     Todd thinks for a moment, realizes something.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Of course, Dad.  It's all right.  Tell\n             Grandpa I'll spend the week with him and\n             Grandma when they get back.\n\n                          MONICA \n             What about Mr. Denker?  I almost forgot about\n             him.  \n\n                          TODD \n             No, He won't want to come.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN & BASEMENT - EVENING\n\n     Archie, seated at the table with his back to Dussander, is in\n     the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which\n     Dussander half-listens.  Dussander goes to the cabinets and \n     takes out two glasses.  He pours the drinks and sets the glasses\n     on the table.  Archie picks his up and is about to drink.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Ah-ah.  \n\n     Dussander picks up his glass to toast Archie.  Archie CLINKS his\n     glass to Dussander's and downs the shot.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             I believe we need another bottle, my friend.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             Well if you're offering, I'm accepting.  \n\n     Dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             No trouble at all.  Now where is my bottle\n             opener?  Ah, here it is.  \n\n     Dussander pulls something out of a drawer.  He goes to the table\n     and stands right behind Archie.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Why don't you drink mine? \n\n     Archie picks up the glass and begins to drink, slower this time.\n     Dussander pulls Archie's tattered hat off his head and sets it\n     on the table.  He then begins to stroke the matted knots of\n     Archie's hair.\n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             You don't mind do you? \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             No. I don't mind. ...Maybe in the morning - \n             everything goes okay - you could let me have\n             ten dollars.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Perhaps.  \n\n                          ARCHIE\n             Maybe even twenty.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Perhaps.  We shall see.  \n\n     Pause.  \n\n                          ARCHIE \n             You can relax, you know, I've done this before.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It's all right.  So have I.  \n\n     Dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of Archie's neck.  \n     He starts to plunge it in just as Archie turns back to look at\n     him.  The fork goes in crooked.  Archie explodes from the chair,\n     HOWLING, his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear.  With\n     the fork protruding from his back, Archie tosses the table to \n     the side.  The empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor\n     and shatters.  Archie spins and slams a fist into Dussander's \n     temple.  Dussander collapses against the counter.  Archie moves\n     about wildly, trying to grab the fork and pummel Dussander at\n     the same time.  Blood is streaming freely from his wound.  \n\n     Dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the\n     counter.  As Archie approaches, Dussander swings the pan into\n     Archie's descending fist.  Archie winces and staggers backward.\n     He stomps down on the broken bottle and screams.  His guard\n     falls briefly.  Dussander is upon him.  He swings the pan,\n     catching Archie squarely in the face.  \n\n     Archie brings his hands up to his face, which now oozes with\n     blood.  Blinded by the blow, Archie charges Dussander, who \n     crouches to the side, and as Archie passes, hurls himself into\n     the man's back, sending him through the open door of the cellar.\n     Archie flies down the stairs face-first, tumbling into the \n     packed dirt floor like a derailed train.  Dussander, exhausted \n     and bloodied, exhales deeply.  Looking down at the crumpled body\n     below, he straightens his tie, brushes the hair from his face,\n     and then surveys the kitchen.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             What a mess.  \n\n     He rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the \n     steps to finish the bum for good.  After about three steps he\n     stops abruptly.  He appears puzzled, but after a moment the\n     expression changes.  A look of searing pain rushes across his \n     face.  Dussander brings his hand to his chest.  He collapses on\n     the stairs.  He is having a heart attack and knows it.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             Oh my God.  \n\n     He looks down at Archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to\n     the cellar.  A moment of decision.  \n\n     The stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they\n     did a minute ago.  Getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward\n     the kitchen.  He starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace,\n     counting with each step.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Ein... Zwei... Drei...  \n\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     The same scene as before.\n\n                          DICK \n             Monica... how long did we rent those jet skis\n             in Hawaii? \n\n                          MONICA \n             About two hours.  Why? \n\n                          DICK \n             This receipt says we had two jet skis for\n             twenty-three hours a piece.  The bill is \n             fifteen hundred dollars.  Didn't you look at\n             the receipt before you signed it? \n\n     Todd doesn't look up from his textbook.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Way to go, Mom.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             That bill was written in Japanese.  I told\n             you that.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Numbers are numbers, Monica, in any language.\n\n                          MONICA \n             That guy didn't speak a word of English.  I\n             told you not to rent from him.  \n\n     The PHONE RINGS.  Monica gets up to get it.  \n\n                          MONICA (CONT'D)\n             I'll get it.  \n\n                          DICK\n             That's not the point.  You should always read\n             the bill before you sign.  I've told you that\n             a hundred times.\n                    (to Todd) \n             Fifteen hundred dollars.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Maybe it's in yen.  \n\n     Pause.  Dick looks at the bill.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Hey, maybe you're right.  \n\n     Monica comes back into the room.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             Todd, it's Mr.  Denker.  He sounds excited \n             about something.  You better speak to him.  \n\n     Todd rises from the couch.  His mood shifts instantly.\n\n                          TODD \n                    (into phone) \n             Mr. Denker? \n\n     INTERCUT: between Todd in his living room and...  \n\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander leaning against a wall in his blood-stained kitchen.\n     The wall above Dussander read 6:50.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Come over right away, boy.  I'm having a\n             heart attack, a bad one, I think.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Gee, that sounds exciting, Mr. Denker, but I\n             was studying for my trig final -- \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I understand that you cannot talk, but you\n             can listen.  I cannot call 911...  at least \n             not yet.  There is quite a mess here.  I need\n             help... and that means you need help.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Well if you put it that way -- \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Tell your parents I've had a letter, an \n             important letter, and I need you to read it\n             to me.\n\n                          TODD \n             Yeah, sure.  I'll be right there.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Now we see what you are made of, boy.  \n\n     Dussander hangs up the phone and falls into a chair.  \n\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n                          TODD\n             Bye.  \n                    (hangs up) \n             I've got to run over to Mr. Denker's for a \n             minute.\n\n                          MONICA \n             Is everything all right? \n\n                          TODD \n             Oh, he just got a letter from a nephew in \n             Hamburg or Dusseldorf or one of those places.  \n\n                          DICK \n             I thought his family was killed in the war.  \n\n     Todd zips up his jacket.  \n\n                          TODD \n             So did he.  That's why he sounded excited.  I\n             shouldn't be too long.  I'll take your car,\n             Mom? \n\n                          MONICA \n             I don't know, you have a final tomorrow.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I know, I was almost finished studying anyway.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Don't be gone too long, Todd.  \n\n                          TODD\n             See you in a bit.  \n\n     He kisses Monica on the cheek.  He is out the front door.\n\n\n     EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD VARIOUS STREETS - NIGHT\n\n     Todd's driving reflects his state of mind: erratic and out of\n     control.  He meets a police car at an intersection and almost \n     runs a red light.  The police car doesn't bother him, however,\n     and a moment later he pulls the Honda up to Dussander's house.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Todd appears in the door of the kitchen.  His face tells us that\n     what he sees is ten times worse than whatever he expected.  The\n     room is a gruesome sight.  Blood and broken glass are \n     everywhere.  The table has been knocked to the side.  Dussander,\n     barely conscious, slumps in a chair.  \n\n                          TODD\n             What the fuck...? \n\n     Todd moves to the center of the room, careful not to step in any\n     blood.  He doesn't know what to do.  His attention falls on\n     Dussander.  Suddenly he rushes to him and begins to inspect his\n     body carefully.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Where are you bleeding?... wake up.\n\n     Dussander does not respond.  Todd shakes him harder.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Wake up, goddamnit! \n\n     Dussander stirs a little, aggravated.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             I thought you said you had a fucking heart attack.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It's not my blood, for Christ's sake.  \n\n     Pause.  \n\n                          TODD\n             What did you say? \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It was self-defense, boy.  Go downstairs.\n             You'll see what needs to be done.  \n\n     Dussander points to the open cellar door.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Fuck you.  I'm not going down there.  What\n             happened?  What did you do? \n\n     Dussander only stares back at him, then looks away, almost \n     smiling through his incredible pain, as if to challenge Todd.\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             What the hell is this? \n\n     Dussander does not respond.  Todd stares at him for a moment,\n     then moves toward the cellar.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Todd is half-way down the stairs when he freezes.  Sprawled out\n     on the ground below him is Archie, motionless.  The meat fork\n     still protrudes from his neck like an antenna.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Jesus Fucking Christ.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Suddenly Dussander is more awake than we realize.  When he hears\n     Todd discover the body, he slides his chair over to the cellar \n     door and slams it shut.  His face is red with pain as he pushes\n     the dead bolt into place, locking Todd in the cellar.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT & KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Todd races up to the door.  He tries the handle and then pounds \n     on the door with his fist.  The following conversation cuts back\n     between Todd and Dussander on opposite sides of the door.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Open the fucking door!  Right now.  Right\n             now! \n\n     Dussander shoves his chair under the doorknob.  He drags the \n     table against the door as he speaks.  Todd is screaming on the\n     other side and begins to kick at the door violently.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You give me no choice, boy.  \n\n                          TODD \n             What are you doing?  Open the door.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             If you won't help me, then I'll make you help\n             me.  If you don't, we are finished.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Fuck you, old man.  This is your problem.  I\n             didn't do this.  Open the door!  \n\n     Todd pounds awayat the door.  Tears now stream down his cheeks.\n     His relentless pounding has Dussander enraged.  Dussander pounds\n     back at the door to shut Todd up.  It works.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Enough.  Enough.  Enough!  If you don't stop\n             screaming like a fucking school girl I'm\n             going to...  \n\n     A surge of pain from his chest silences him.  He recovers,\n     speaking slowly and deliberately.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             Now listen to me, boy, very carefully.  If\n             you don't help me, I'm going to die here.  \n             And if I die, there is no Stanford for you.  \n             There is no scholarship.  There is jail.  My \n             document...  \n\n                          TODD \n             Fuck your document.  I got nothing to do with\n             this.  Don't make it sound like I do.  I came\n             here, I saw this shit, and now I'm getting \n             the fuck out of here.  That's what I'm gonna\n             tell the police.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Why not tell them the truth?  Tell them I\n             locked you in the cellar.  Tell them I \n             wouldn't let you out until you buried the\n             body.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I'm not listening to this.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Todd runs down the stairs and leaps over Archie's body.  Under \n     the dim glow of a single naked bulb hanging from the ceiling, he\n     searches for a way out.  He crosses the dirt floor toward a tiny\n     window high on the opposite wall.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You must be at the window, yes?  As you can\n             see I had it barred a few years ago.  A bad\n             element started to move into the \n             neighborhood, you know how it is.  \n\n                          TODD (O.S.)\n             Fuck.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Todd realizes he can't get through the bars.  He turns around to\n     find another option.  In the obscured background, Archie begins\n     to stir.  Silent and bewildered, he feels the area around him \n     and rises slowly to his knees.  Todd doesn't see him and moves \n     into a dark corner of the cellar, rummaging through the piles of\n     cluttered junk for something to help him escape.  He disappears\n     for a moment into complete darkness and then emerges holding a\n     shovel, a fresh confidence on his face.  He holds it like a\n     sledge hammer.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (O.S.)\n             We are wasting time now, boy.  \n                    (switches to a loud whisper) \n             Come back to the door.  You are not going to\n             find anything down there to help you.  \n\n                          TODD \n                    (to himself)\n             Oh really?  \n\n     Todd runs toward the staircase and is only a few feet from\n     Archie when he sees him.  Todd, mortified, lets out a scream.\n     This startles Archie, who cannot speak.  He only gurgles a\n     SICKENING WHINE, the fork still sticks out of his neck.  Blood\n     drips into his eyes from a gash above his forehead.  Yet even on\n     his knees, he is an imposing figure.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander, puzzled by the commotion, presses his ear against the\n     door.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Archie blocks the stairs from Todd.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Get out of the way.\n\n     But Archie is too disoriented to move.  Summoning all his\n     courage, Todd pokes the shovel into him, as if to prod him out\n     of the way.\n\n     But when the blade of the shovel touches him, Archie counters\n     violently, grabbing the metal end and swinging it to the side.  \n     Todd holds tightly to the handle, an act which sends him flying\n     across the cellar.  The shovel stays with Archie, and now he \n     wields it like it were a child's toy.  He slashes it viciously\n     through the air.  Todd hides under the stairs, watching Archie \n     duel with the shadows.  Todd bumps into something.  Archie hears\n     him.  Through the slats in the staircase we see Archie jabbing\n     the shovel at Todd.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Stop it!  Stop it!  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Alarmed, Dussander reaches for the lock, but hesitates, forever\n     mindful of the chance of being duped.  His ear goes back against \n     the door.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             What are you doing, boy?  It's not going to\n             work, whatever it is.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Archie pushes the shovel in too far and can't retrieve it.  Todd\n     grabs the other end and pulls it through.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Fuck this.  \n\n     Fed up, he comes around from under the stairs and confronts\n     Archie.  Archie sees him and takes a step toward him.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             I mean it get the fuck away from me.  \n\n     Archie steps closer.  Instantly, Todd tightens his grip on the\n     shovel.  He is no longer afraid.  He swings the shovel at \n     Archie's head striking him.  Archie staggers back, stunned, but \n     then charges forward.  Todd strikes him again, this time with\n     more force and anger.  Todd lifts the shovel to strike again,\n     but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade.\n     The glass shatters.  The room goes black.  \n\n     A second later we HEAR a SHARP, authoritative BLOW, followed \n     quickly by another, then another.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Dussander knows something is wrong.  He slides the bolt back and\n     slowly turns the handle.  He opens the door slightly and speaks\n     into the darkness.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Hello?  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     A shaft of dull light from the kitchen cuts across the cellar\n     floor, revealing Archie's slain body.  An expanding pool of\n     blood seeps out from his head.  As the door upstairs opens \n     wider, the light falls on Todd standing over Archie, the shovel\n     still in his hands, his face spattered with blood.\n\n     The Todd we knew only a minute ago has been transformed.  He\n     stares up at Dussander, not with the eyes of a boy, but with \n     those of a man.  A man who can no longer be saved.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Quietly Dussander moves away from the door, leaving Todd alone\n     with what he has done.  He slides the furniture away from the\n     door, knowing, as Todd does, that the two of them are now\n     working together.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - LATER\n\n     Todd's face is suddenly illuminated as he screws a fresh light \n     bulb into the dangling cord.  He picks up the shovel.  Archie's\n     body still lies where it fell.  Todd goes to the open area of\n     the floor and with a forceful stomp, plunges the shovel into the\n     dirt.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     Todd smacks the back of the shovel on the finished grave to pack\n     the dirt, then smooths the area over to destroy any markings.\n     He is sweaty, dirty, and tired.  But his manner is cool and\n     efficient as he concentrates intently on the matters at hand.\n     He runs upstairs, hopping over the bloody spot where Archie's\n     body used to be.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Todd bursts through the door.  He notices the old man in his\n     chair.  Dussander doesn't look good.  Todd levels his eyes at\n     him.  His voice snaps with the authority of an S.S. commander.\n\n                          TODD \n             Where's the fucking pinesol?  \n\n     Dussander points to the cabinet under the sink.  Todd throws the\n     door open and pulls out bottles of cleaner.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Rags.  I need rags.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Cellar.  Under the stairs.  \n\n     Todd checks the clock, it is 9:25.  He gets the bottle and a\n     bucket and goes for the cellar.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     A SERIES OF SHOTS showing Todd cleaning up the mess.  He is on\n     the stairs sponging up the blood.  Then we see him skimming the \n     area where the pool of blood was with the shovel.  The NEXT SHOT\n     has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area.  Then, on his\n     knees, he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light\n     bulb and drops them into a bucket.  In the FINAL SHOT, Todd \n     stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar.  The shovel has\n     been cleaned and replaced.  The floor looks smooth and even.\n     Satisfied, he goes upstairs.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     The table has been put back in its spot.  Todd is in his boxer\n     shorts.  A SHOT of a washing machine, somewhere else in the \n     house, shows us that Todd is cleaning his bloodied clothes.  Now\n     he is washing the dishes in the sink.  The water in the sink is \n     a murky pink.  He pulls the meat fork from the suds and holds it up.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I ought to run this through your chest, you\n             know that?\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             It couldn't hurt more than a heart attack.  \n\n     He looks at the clock - 10:15.\n\n                          TODD \n             Christ, my parents are going to freak.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Stay calm, boy.  You are doing fine.  \n\n     Todd dries the murder weapon and puts it away.  For a moment he\n     slows down, a hint of a smile suddenly comes over him.\n     Dussander sees something is different about him.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D)\n             What are you thinking about?  \n\n     The sound of Dussander's voice snaps Todd out of his funk.  He\n     is all business again.\n\n                          TODD\n             Fuck off.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     Todd is back in his clothes.  He wears a white T-shirt.  He \n     brings a knife up to Dussander's neck and slices down his suit,\n     still stained by Archie's blood.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Your pants are okay.  The shoes... no.\n\n     Todd takes off Dussander's shoes and balls them up in the\n     tattered suit.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Put this on.  \n\n     He holds up Dussander's bathrobe.  The old man slips into it\n     with difficulty as Todd dumps the bloodied clothing into a trash\n     bag.  Dussander looks at Todd's T-shirt.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Is that my undershirt?  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     The blood and glass have been removed.  Todd runs a mop over the\n     floor.  His job is almost over.  Sweat pours down his face.  The\n     same for Dussander.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Hurry up, for God's sake.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Don't you die on me, you old bastard.  Not\n             now.\n\n     Todd puts the mop away.  He surveys the room as before.  \n     Dussander does the same.  There is a strange silence as the two\n     of them look around the room for anything damning.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I think we're okay.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Me too.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Call an ambulance. \n\n     Todd turns to face Dussander.  He brings his face up to his and\n     speaks softly.\n\n                          TODD\n             The key.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             What are you talking about?  \n\n                          TODD \n             The safety deposit box.  I want the key...  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             For God's sake, boy...  \n\n                          TODD \n             I want the key and I want to know where the\n             bank is.\n\n     Dussander cannot argue.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Hillcrest Savings on Domingo Avenue.  The key\n             is behind the clock on the mantle piece.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Todd goes straight for the mantle.  He moves the clock and finds\n     the key.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     Todd holds a blank piece of paper in front of Dussander and\n     hands him a pen.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Sign this.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             What for?  \n\n                          TODD \n             Sign it.  \n\n     Dussander starts to scrawl his name across the paper.  \n\n                          TODD \n             No!  At the bottom... neatly.\n\n     With great difficulty, Dussander does as he is told.  Todd folds\n     the paper and stuffs it into his pocket with the pen.  He picks\n     up the phone and dials.  \n\n                          DISPATCHER (V.O.) \n             911 emergency.  Do you need an ambulance?  \n\n                          TODD \n             Yes.  It's my friend, Mr. Du--\n\n     Todd nearly bites his lip in half.  Dussander notices the slip\n     and cringes.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Denker.  He had a heart attack.  \n\n                          DISPATCHER (V.O.)\n             Is he conscious?  \n\n                          TODD \n             Yeah, he's awake.  I'm really scared.  The\n             address is 9 -- \n\n                          DISPATCHER (V.O.) \n             We have the address here.  The ambulance is \n             on the way.  It should take about ten\n             minutes.  I'll stay on the line with you -- \n\n                          TODD \n             No.  I have to call my parents.  Just send\n             the ambulance -- \n\n     He hangs up.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             It smells too clean in here.  \n\n     Todd sees a pack of cigarettes on the table.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n                    (offering)\n             Cigarette?  \n\n     Dussander is not amused.  Todd lights two cigarettes and lets \n     them burn down in the ashtray.  He picks up the phone again and\n     dials.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Mommy, it's me.  Let me talk to Dad.  \n\n                          MONICA (V.O.)\n             What is it?  \n\n                          TODD \n             Just let me talk to him.  \n\n                          MONICA (V.O.)\n             Hold on -- \n\n                          DICK (V.O.)\n             Todd, what's wrong.\n\n                          TODD\n             Mr. Denker had a heart attack.  \n\n                          DICK (V.O.)\n             Jesus.  Is he conscious?  \n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah, he's awake.  \n\n                          DICK (V.O.)\n             Thank God.  Todd, call an ambulance.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I did.  They're on the way.  \n\n                          DICK (V.O.) \n             All right, son.  Don't touch him.  I'll be\n             there in five minutes.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Okay.  \n\n     He hangs up.  He sits down across from Dussander.  The old man\n     is near death, but through the slit of an eye he watches Todd.\n     The stare between them is lethal.  For a long moment this\n     continues until...\n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Fuck!  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             What?  What is it?  \n\n                          TODD \n             The letter.  Where is the goddamn letter?  I\n             told my parents I came over to read you a\n             letter from Germany.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             A letter.  Yes, we'll say it's from Willi\n             Frankel -- \n\n                          TODD \n             We need a letter.  I told them it was your\n             nephew, I think.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My bedroom.  Look in the dresser.  Second, no\n             third, drawer... from the top.  There is a \n             small wooden box.  You will have to break it \n             open.  I lost the key.  There are letters,\n             very old ones.  From a friend.  All in \n             German.  None of them are signed or dated.  A\n             page or two will be fine.  \n\n     Todd turns to go and stops.\n\n                          TODD \n             Are you crazy?  I don't read German, you numb\n             fuck.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Why would Willi write me in English?  If you \n             were to read me the letter in German, I would\n             understand even though you would not.  Your \n             pronunciation would be terrible, but I could\n             manage -- \n\n                          TODD \n             All right.  All right.  \n\n     Todd dashes out of the room.  \n\n\n     EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT\n\n     Dick's Porsche speeds along the same streets that Todd took two\n     hours earlier.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Todd bursts through the door and drops to his knees in front of \n     the dresser.  He yanks on the drawer.  It comes half way out and\n     stops.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Goddamn you, come out.  \n\n     The drawer flies out, knocking Todd back.  He digs through it, \n     the contents of Dussander's fake lives spilling about the room.\n     He finds the box at the bottom.  As he expected, it is locked.\n     Without a moment's hesitation, he slams the box down on the post\n     of the bed frame.  It doesn't open, but bits of the frame fly\n     across the room.  \n\n     On the third attempt the tiny box shatters.  Todd freezes, cocks\n     his head.  Outside he hears the distinct ROAR and sputter of the\n     Porsche engine.  He grabs two pages of a letter.  There is \n     nothing he can do about the mess in the room.  He closes the \n     door on his way back to the kitchen.\n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     Todd enters the kitchen and places the pages on the table just \n     in time to look up and see Dick standing in the kitchen doorway.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Dad.  \n\n     We hold on Dick for a moment as he takes it all in: Dussander,\n     Todd, and the room.  A hint of uncertainty crosses his face.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER\n\n     A PARAMEDIC straps Dussander onto a stretcher.  Todd is talking\n     to the other one.  \n\n                          TODD \n             He started laughing at something in the \n             letter.  I don't know what it was, it's in\n             German.\n\n     Dick sees the letter on the table and picks it up.  Todd watches\n     him.  Without much of a thought, Dick puts the letter back on\n     the table.  \n\n                          PARAMEDIC \n             Well, we'll take care of him now.  We're \n             going to take him to St. Luke's.  It's a good\n             thing you called when you did.  You saved his\n             life.  \n\n     The medics wheel Dussander out.  \n\n                          DICK \n             You did real good, son.  \n                    (looking around the room, as if\n                    searching for something)\n             You did real good...  \n\n     Todd doesn't like Dick's apprehension.  He grabs his father's\n     hand and leads him out of the room.  \n\n                          TODD \n             C'mon.  Let's make sure he gets checked in\n             all right.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n     TWO ORDERLIES push a gurney through the door.  A man in his late\n     thirties, DAVID KRAUSS, walks with them.  A NURSE, following\n     behind, addresses him.\n\n                          NURSE\n             He needs to rest now.  You can come back \n             tomorrow after ten.  \n\n     David approaches the gurney.  Lying prone is BEN KRAUSS, 70.\n     David kisses him on the forehead.  \n\n                          DAVID \n             I'll be back in the morning with the girls.  \n\n                          BEN \n             I can't wait to see them.  \n\n     The orderlies lift Ben onto his bed.  \n\n                          NURSE\n                    (to Ben) \n             The doctor will be in to see you in a few\n             minutes.\n\n                          BEN\n             Thank you.\n\n     The orderlies, the nurse and David leave the room.  Ben notices\n     his roommate in the next bed.  It is Dussander, who has been\n     watching all of this quietly.  \n\n                          BEN (CONT'D)\n             My nephew, David.  \n\n     Dussander smiles politely.  \n\n                          BEN (CONT'D) \n             His parents died when he was very young.  He\n             is like a son to me.  I have no children of\n             my own.\n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I see.  \n\n                          BEN \n             David is very protective of me.  Of course, I\n             don't mind.  I enjoy his company.  A few \n             years ago he started working with me at the\n             university.  I teach chemistry.  My name is\n             Ben, by the way.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Arthur.  \n\n                          BEN \n             A pleasure, Arthur.  What do you do?  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             I'm retired.  \n\n     Pause.  \n\n                          BEN \n             These tubes in my arm.  No one said they\n             would itch like this.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             You will find, in time, you don't notice.  \n\n     Ben looks oddly at Dussander.  The wheels of his memory slowly,\n     very slowly, begin to turn.  \n\n                          BEN \n             Well, we'll see.  Looks like I'll be here for\n             a while.  I didn't want to alarm my nephew\n             just yet, but this break in my leg...  well,\n             we'll see what the doctor says.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes, of course.  But for now, you must \n             forgive me, my medication has made me drowsy.\n             Do not be offended if I fall asleep.  \n\n                          BEN \n             Don't be offended if I keep talking anyway.  \n             It beats wondering if I'm ever going to walk \n             again.  I tell you, my friend, the ways of\n             God are not meant to be understood.  \n\n     But Ben's words are lost on a sleeping man.  He continues to\n     stare at Dussander.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Todd comes through the front door, using his key to get in.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Todd grabs the letter off the table and stuffs it into a plastic\n     trash bag.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Todd manages to get the drawer back into the dresser.  He throws\n     all the remaining debris and bits of wood into the trash bag.  He\n     goes to the closet and searches through the clothes.  He \n     finds the S.S. uniform, now tattered from many night of fitful\n     sleep, and places it in the trash bag.  \n\n\n     INT. HILLCREST SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY\n\n     The BANK CLERK behind the counter is a fat, elderly woman, \n     pleasant-faced and not too sharp.  Todd stands solemnly on the \n     other side of the counter.  She stares hard at a piece of paper.\n     We see that it is a note: \"Please allow my grandson, Todd, to\n     retrieve my insurance documents from my safety deposit box.  \n     Thank you, Arthur Denker.\"  It is Dussander's phony signature\n     at the bottom.  \n\n                          TODD \n             He's really sick. ...Please.\n\n     The woman looks up at Todd, the key in his hand, then back down\n     at the note.  \n\n\n     INT. BANK SAFE - DAY\n\n     The woman inserts her key into the first lock and Todd does the \n     same in the second.  A moment later he is holding the box in his\n     hands.  \n\n                          BANK CLERK\n             I sure hope your granddaddy feels better.\n             You can bring that in here.  \n\n     She escorts him to a small room where he can view the contents\n     of the box.  She leaves.  \n\n\n     INT. BANK - SMALL ROOM - DAY\n\n     Todd puts the box on a table and opens it.  It is nearly empty:\n     a few old photographs, some financial records.  There is no\n     document.  Todd is swept up in a wave of emotion-- anger,\n     relief, contempt.  He's been played like a fool, but is \n     nonetheless grateful.  Ultimately, he is so overwhelmed a laugh\n     springs from his lips.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Son of a bitch.  \n\n     He scoops out the contents of the box and puts them in his pocket.  \n\n\n     INT. BANK SAFE - DAY\n\n     On the other side of the door, the clerk listens curiously to\n     Todd's words.  She pushes her ear against the door to hear more.  \n\n\n     EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK\n\n     Todd has dug a hole in a remote location.  He empties the\n     letters, the S.S. uniform, and the contents from the safety \n     deposit box into the hole.  A little lighter fluid.  A match.\n     Todd watches the evidence burn.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER\n\n     Todd stands next to the bed holding a small clump of flowers.\n     Dussander notices the bouquet.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             You shouldn't have.  \n\n     Todd is aware that Ben is listening, even though he is \n     pretending not to.  Todd goes to put the flowers in a glass of\n     water.  He sets the glass on the table by the bed.  \n\n                          TODD \n             They're from my mother.  \n\n     He sits in the chair by the bed and lowers his voice.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Here.  \n\n     He flicks a tattered photo onto the bed.  We recognize it as one \n     from the safety deposit box.  It is a black and white portrait\n     of a woman and a small boy.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Everything else I burned.  \n\n     Dussander grins weekly.\n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I had to protect myself from you, boy.  \n\n     Todd drags a screen over to prevent Ben from hearing.  Long pause.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (CONT'D) \n             I suspect that we shall never see each other\n             again.\n\n                          TODD \n             No, I don't think we will.  \n\n     Dussander looks almost hurt to hear Todd say it.  Pause.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Well, I better go.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Wait, boy... There is something I want to ask\n             you.  \n\n                          TODD\n             What?  \n\n     Dussander waves him over with his finger.  Reluctantly, Todd\n     brings his ear an inch from Dussander's mouth.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             ...Was it like you thought?  \n\n     Todd pulls his head back, stands up.  He contemplates the \n     question, ...confessing.  He touches Dussander on the shoulder.  \n\n                          TODD\n             I should go.  \n\n     He turns for the door.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Perhaps... perhaps I could persuade you to\n             wait here just until I fall asleep.  This\n             medicine makes me quite woozy... please.  \n\n     Todd resigns himself to stay.  He picks up a magazine and begins\n     to read, not even looking at Dussander.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER\n\n     Todd emerges from behind the screen toward the door.  Dussander\n     is asleep.  \n\n                          BEN \n             Excuse me, young man.  \n\n     Todd is startled.  \n\n                          BEN (CONT'D) \n             You're a fine boy to visit your grandfather\n             like that.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Thanks.  But he's just a friend.\n\n                          BEN \n             Is that right?  Well, you are a good friend \n             to him.  Tell me, is he bad off?  He doesn't \n             talk much.\n\n                          TODD \n             The doctors say he'll be out soon.  \n\n                          BEN \n             That is good news, indeed.  Tell me, from the \n             way he speaks I'd guess he's been\n             naturalized, like me.  Is he?  \n\n     Todd is starting to be wary of where this is going.  \n\n                          TODD \n             He's from Germany... From Essen.  Do you know\n             that town?  \n\n                          BEN \n             I was only in Germany once.  I'm Polish.  \n             Originally, I mean, I'm from Radom.  I wonder\n             if he was in the war.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I really couldn't say.  \n\n                          BEN \n             It doesn't matter, I suppose.  It was a long\n             time ago, the war.  Soon in this country we\n             may have a president born after the war was\n             over.  How about that?  \n\n     Todd starts to leave.  \n\n                          TODD \n             I'm sure you're right.  \n\n                          BEN \n             Your friend is lucky to have you.  A great \n             man once said, 'No man is an island entire of\n             itself.' \n\n                          TODD \n             John Donne.  Take care, sir.  \n\n     Todd heads for the door.  He stops, turns back to Dussander's\n     bed.  He contemplates something... waking him.  He decides\n     against it.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Good-bye.  \n\n                          BEN\n             Good-bye.  \n\n     Todd exits.  Ben sits quietly for a moment, thinking.  He turns\n     on the television-- \"The Price is Right\".  We hear it over the\n     following.  Ben glances over at the screen which separates him\n     from Dussander.  Slowly his eyelids begin to get heavy.  He\n     starts to nod off.  But as sleep begins to envelope him, his \n     eyes suddenly fly open.  A surge of terror burns across his\n     face.  \n\n     He sits up frightened.  A single crutch stands next to the bed.\n     He grabs it.  He strips away his covers and the restraints on \n     his leg, once or twice shoving his hand over his mouth to quell\n     a painful scream.  He gets to his feet awkwardly, hobbling, \n     half-dragging his bad leg.  Every step he takes is a study in\n     agony.\n\n     ANGLE on the screen.  It slides out of the way, revealing Ben \n     staring down at the sleeping Dussander.  In the pained struggle\n     to keep silent, he brings his face right up to Dussander's,\n     close enough to smell his breath.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUING\n\n     Ben stumbles out of his room into the hall.  The crutch falls to\n     the ground.  He slides against the wall toward the nurses' \n     station.  Tears stream down his face.  As he clutches the wall,\n     we glimpse the faded green numbers on his forearm.  \n\n     He reaches the nurse's desk.  She is on the phone.  He grabs her\n     by the shoulder and pulls her face up into his.  She lets out a \n     startled SCREAM.  But Ben's emotion stops her from resisting.  \n     He is sobbing uncontrollably.  Orderlies appear and pull him off\n     of her.  He collapses to the ground, consumed by grief.  \n\n                                                                BLACK.\n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n     Dussander slowly wakes up for the first time since his surgery.  \n     A large black man, DARREN, stands above him changing the IV bag.\n     He notices Dussander is awake.  Dussander's voice is low and\n     hoarse from hours of sedation.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Where's the nurse?  \n\n                          DARREN \n             My name is Darren.  I'll be taking care of \n             you from now on.  I'll tell the doctor you've\n             woken up.  \n\n     Darren finishes with the IV unit and goes to the door.  \n     Dussander watches him, a bit puzzled, but his eyes are closed\n     again before Darren is out of the room.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - LATER\n\n     Dussander wakes up again.  Something is different in his room.  \n     He looks to the table next to him.  All his magazines are gone.\n     He looks to the other side of the room.  Ben is gone, his bed\n     stripped of all linen.  Finally he looks to the door.  It is \n     cracked open.  Two men in suits are talking in the hallway.  One\n     we will come to know as Detective GETTY.  The other is a\n     subordinate.  Dussander is clearly bothered by what he sees.  He\n     reaches over for the call button and rings it several times.  \n\n     A moment later Darren comes in.  Getty sees this and stops\n     talking.  He watches Dussander from the hall.  \n\n                          DARREN \n             Did you need something?  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             What is going on here?  Where is Ben?  \n\n                          DARREN \n             Mr. Krauss has been moved.  I'm going to give\n             you something.  It will help you sleep.  \n\n     Darren readies Dussander's arm for an injection.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I don't want it.  Who is that man?  \n\n     Before Dussander can protest, Darren sticks him with the needle.  \n\n                          DARREN \n             Your surgery was a success.  Just try to\n             relax.\n\n                                                        FADE TO BLACK.\n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING\n\n                          WEISKOPF (O.S.)\n                    (in German)\n             Wake up.  Wake up, old man.  \n\n     Dussander's eyes open.  The first thing he sees are three men,\n     all in suits, standing over him.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER (in German)\n             Are you speaking to me?  \n\n     The voice comes from WEISKOPF, 40's.  His suit is dark gray, \n     well tailored, probably European.  He speaks eloquently despite\n     an accent that shows roots of Europe and the Middle East.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF\n                    (back in English)\n             No one else is here.  \n\n     Dussander looks over at Ben's former bed.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF (CONT'D) \n             Mr. Krauss is recuperating elsewhere.  Are\n             you awake now, Dussander?  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             Yes, of course, but you seem to have me\n             confused with someone else.  My name is \n             Arthur Denker.  Perhaps you want a different\n             room -- \n\n     Weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed.  Dussander notices the pin\n     on his lapel.  A small, silver Star of David.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF \n             My name is Weiskopf.  You are Kurt Dussander.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             I know no one by that name.  Shall I ring for\n             the nurse?  \n\n     Dussander reaches for the Call button and stops in horror.  He \n     looks at his hands.  His fingertips are smeared with black ink.\n     He looks up at the men in disbelief.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF\n             The man in the next bed was Benjamin Krauss.\n             He was imprisoned for ten months at Patin.\n             You were responsible for the death of his \n             wife and two daughters.  His identification\n             of you was quite specific.  I'm sure his \n             reward from my government will help offset\n             the burden of his broken leg.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER \n             My name is Arthur Denker.  I am an American-- \n\n                          WEISKOPF\n             Please don't bother.  Your papers will not \n             stand up to serious examination and you know\n             it.  \n\n     The detective, GETTY, snaps a few pictures of Dussander.  The\n     other man is FBI Special Agent DAN RICHLER.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             We have all we need here, Isaac.  \n\n                          DUSSANDER\n             Who are you men?  What are your names?  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             My name is Richler, FBI.  This is Detective\n             Getty from the Orange County Sheriff's\n             Department.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF \n             And I think you know who I work for.  When\n             you get your strength back, you will be \n             moved.  Until then, this entire ward will be\n             under surveillance.  You can expect to be in\n             Tel Aviv by the end of the summer.  \n\n     The three men are out the door.  \n\n\n     INT. TODD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Todd's room is dark as he lies on the floor, writing something \n     on a pile of index cards.  The only light comes from the hallway\n     through the open door of the bedroom.  Todd is deep in thought,\n     but from the bits of shredded index cards we can tell the\n     writing is not coming easily.  \n\n                          TODD \n             The road ahead reveals itself, uh, God, no.\n             The road ahead... grrrr, The fucking road\n             ahead.\n\n     Monica appears in the doorway.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             Todd?\n\n     Todd doesn't notice her.  He stares down at the card.  Finally he\n     looks up, as if it took her voice a few seconds to register in\n     his mind.  His response is hardly audible.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Huh?  \n\n                          MONICA \n             What are you doing there in the dark?  \n\n                          TODD\n             Oh, ...working.  \n\n     Monica reaches in to his room to turn on the light.  She touches\n     the switch but then pulls her hand back.  Todd is back at the \n     note card.  She looks at him oddly, worried, but then steps away\n     from the door and goes downstairs.\n\n     Todd's lips are moving, as if he were speaking to himself.  He\n     pauses.  Then, in a sudden gust of inspiration begins to write\n     furiously.  He finishes and stands up, catching his reflection \n     in the mirror above his desk.  In the eerie half-light, he\n     stares at the ghost-like image of himself.  \n\n\n     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD (GRADUATION) - DAY\n\n     Todd, in cap and gown, is seeing his parents to their seats in \n     the second row.  Ed French comes up to Todd and puts his hand on\n     his shoulder.  Todd is startled.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Mr. French.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Hello, Todd.  It's your big day, isn't it?  \n\n     They shake hands.  French sees Dick and Monica sitting behind\n     Todd.  Before Todd can stop him, he introduces himself.  \n\n                          FRENCH (CONT'D)\n             These must be your parents.\n                    (extends hand) \n             Hi, Ed French.  It's good to finally meet\n             you.  \n\n     Dick and Monica are the picture of happiness, hardly the\n     dysfunctional drunkards that French believed them to be.  They \n     all shake hands.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Dick Bowden, nice to meet you.  This is my\n             wife, Monica.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             Are you one of Todd's teachers?  \n\n     French is a bit puzzled.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             No.  I'm his guidance counsellor.  \n\n     A WOMAN behind Monica taps her on the shoulder.  \n\n                          WOMAN\n             Monica, I thought that was you.  \n\n     Monica turns away from French.  Suddenly, the band strikes up\n     opening notes to \"Pomp and Circumstance.\"\n\n                          TODD\n                    (to French)\n             That's our cue.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n                    (to Dick) \n             It was nice meeting you.  \n\n                          DICK\n             You too.  \n                    (to Todd)\n             Good luck, son.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I'll talk to you and your wife after the\n             ceremony.  \n\n     Todd and French dash off in different directions.  \n\n\n     EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER\n\n     Standing at the podium is a black, female graduate, TASHA \n     LITTLE.  She is reading the end of a poem by Emily Dickinson.  \n     Principal Morgan and Todd sit in chairs next to the podium. In\n     the b.g. is the graduating class, Joey is among them.   French\n     sits among the faculty, who are lined up to the right of the\n     podium.  \n\n                          TASHA \n             Thy sacred emblems to partake -\n             Thy consecrated bread to take \n             And thine immortal wine!  \n\n     There is polite applause from the audience as she takes her seat\n     and Morgan goes to the podium.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Thank you, Miss Little for that superb\n             invocation.\n\n     Pause.  More applause.  \n\n                          MORGAN (CONT'D) \n             And now it gives me great pleasure to\n             introduce a young man who's academic \n             achievement at this institution stands as\n             testament to the power of hard work and \n             determination.  Todd had a tough time a few\n             months ago, so by God, he buckled down, hit\n             the books, and pulled himself through it.  \n\n     Todd's eyes scan the crowd indifferently.  He notices Becky,\n     seated in the audience near some friends.  \n\n                          MORGAN (CONT'D)\n             Ladies and gentlemen, students and faculty,\n             here to deliver the student remembrance for \n             the class of 1985, this year's valedictorian,\n             Todd Bowden.\n\n     The crowd burst into applause.  \n\n\n     EXT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     A half dozen police cars are in front of the house.  One OFFICER\n     is blocking off the entire yard with yellow tape.  A news van\n     pulls up.\n\n\n     EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING\n\n     Todd shakes Morgan's hand and takes the podium.  The crowd\n     quiets.  Todd begins: \n\n                          TODD \n             We all have dreams that we carry with us.\n             Perhaps it is a dream of prosperity, or \n             happiness.  But now, so early in our lives, \n             it seems that all we should ask for is to be\n             at peace with the world, because only then\n             can we be at peace with ourselves.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Weiskopf and Richler, both wearing rubber gloves, are carefully\n     looking through the contents of Dussander's dresser.  They pour\n     over everything, placing some items in clear plastic bags.  A\n     few DEPUTIES are milling around.  Richler picks up a small\n     photograph of a young woman.  Todd's voice comes in: \n\n                          TODD (V.O.)\n             We learn from our education that we are the \n             master's of our own destinies.  We learn what\n             it is that separates us from the others, why\n             we are special.  \n\n                          RICHLER\n             What about this?  \n\n                          WEISKOPF \n             Yes.  All photographs.  \n\n     Detective Getty comes in.\n\n                          GETTY \n             You boys better come down to the cellar.\n             You're not going to believe this.  \n\n\n     INT. DUSSANDER'S BASEMENT - DAY\n\n     Getty comes down the steps followed by Weiskopf and Richler.\n     Weiskopf gazes across the cellar.  Whatever he sees disturbs\n     him.  He turns away and goes back up the stairs.  \n\n                          TODD (V.O.) \n             Each of us have unique talents and interests\n             unlike those of anyone else.  The challenge \n             now, as we stand at the doorway to adulthood,\n             is to channel our abilities into our goals.  \n\n     Richler, moves to the rail and looks out, disgusted.  He pulls a\n     handkerchief from his pocket and covers his nose and mouth.  A\n     DEPUTY, wearing rubber gloves, carries the shovel up to him.  \n\n\n     EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - CONTINUING\n\n     As Todd speaks, he notices his parents, Becky, various teachers.\n     His eyes stop on Ed French, who is looking oddly at something in\n     the crowd.  \n\n     ANGLE ON FRENCH \n\n     French notices an elderly couple walking down the aisles of\n     seated spectators as if they are looking for someone.  \n\n                          TODD (O.C.) \n             We forge our own paths.  Our education is but\n             a stepping stone to the world.  \n\n     They are Victor and Agnes Bowden, looking for Dick and Monica.\n     Todd sees them too.  He pauses almost imperceptibly.  He looks\n     back at French.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             Our.. Our true destinies await us.  There we\n             become the...\n\n     Todd's grandparents come down the aisle to see Dick and Monica\n     in the second row.  They start to slide in, causing a slight\n     ruckus.  Dick is surprised to see his parents, but smiles and\n     makes room for them.  French watches all of this curiously.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             There we become the men and women that will\n             make a difference.  But we must take away \n             from this place a sense of purpose for\n             ourselves.  We now begin to see the road \n             ahead.  It is a road from which we cannot\n             veer.\n\n     A connection is made between French, Todd, and the Bowden\n     family.\n\n\n     EXT. GRADUATION - DAY - LATER\n\n     Morgan is reading the last of the names as the graduates file\n     past and collect their diplomas.  \n\n                          MORGAN \n             Andrew Woodman... Donald Young... Karmisha \n             Youngblood... David Zedek... Kyle Zuckerman.\n             The graduating class of 1985.  \n\n     The crowd cheers as the graduates throw their caps into the air.\n     The band begins to play.  \n\n                          MORGAN (CONT'D) \n             Now we invite all the friends and parents to\n             join the students and faculty in the main\n             courtyard for refreshments.  \n\n     Todd, still pale, bolts off the stage.  He reaches his parents.\n     French starts to walk down to the Bowdens.  Todd goes up to his\n     mother.  \n\n                          MONICA\n             Honey.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Mom, I don't feel so good.  \n\n                          MONICA\n             What's wrong?  \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't know, I feel like I'm going to pass\n             out.  Can we go home?  \n\n                          AGNES \n             You looked real good up there, Todd.  \n\n     Todd ignores her.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Don't you want to see your buddies?  \n\n                          TODD \n             I want to go, Dad.  Right now.  \n\n     Todd and his family start off.  As they leave the CAMERA MOVES\n     to show Ed French working his way through the crowd past the\n     spot where they had been standing.\n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The following series of images appear under music:\n\n     The quiet wing of this hospital has transformed into a frenzied \n     sea of reporters, cameramen, photographers, and police officers.\n     Everyone is struggling for a glimpse of the infamous celebrity\n     through the window that looks into Dussander's room.  Inside, \n     Weiskopf and Richler are speaking to the doctors.  Getty stands\n     to the side, instructing the DEPUTY who guards the door.  \n\n     Through all of this Dussander lies like a fossil in his bed as\n     the bodies whirl around him.  Darren enters the room to change\n     Dussander's IV bag.  \n\n     Suddenly the door flies open and a young photographer dashes in,\n     snapping pictures wildly.  Getty and the other officers descend\n     upon him.  The camera flashes.  Other photographers try to get\n     in but are blocked.  Pandemonium.  \n\n     Yet Dussander seems oblivious to the commotion.  His eyes are\n     nothing more than glazed slits, his mouth hangs open.  Darren \n     runs toward the door to help.  Dussander's eyes open slightly.\n     There is life behind them after all.  He turns his attention\n     imperceptibly toward his IV bag...  \n\n     The camera moves away from Dussander to the window.  Outside in\n     the parking lot, groups of protesters have gathered.  Some hold \n     candles.  Others chant and wave signs.  News reporters surround \n     them.\n\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM - BOWDEN HOUSE - DAY\n\n     ANGLE on a ticking wall clock.  \n\n     Todd appears apprehensive as he sits down on the couch next to \n     his mother.  She puts her arm around him.  He is pale and\n     glassy-eyed.  His parents don't look much better.  Dick is\n     especially nervous and stands off to the side, watching everyone\n     intently.  Richler and Weiskopf sit across the room in chairs.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Todd, my name is Dan Richler.  I'm a special \n             agent with the FBI.  This is my associate, Dr.\n             Weiskopf.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF\n             Hello.  \n\n                          DICK \n             What kind of doctor are you?  \n\n                          WEISKOPF\n             I'm a school teacher.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Dr. Weiskopf is a professor at the Judaic\n             Institute in Munich.  He is assisting the \n             Israeli government in certain matters.  He is\n             here today, only as an observer.  \n\n     A moment passes between Weiskopf and Todd.  \n\n                          RICHLER (CONT'D) \n             Thanks for calling us up, Mr. Bowden.  You \n             saved us the trouble of tracking through the\n             911 records.\n\n                          DICK \n             Actually, it was Todd's idea to call.  He \n             thought... we thought there might be some way\n             we could help your investigation.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Todd, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to hear\n             about your involvement with Dussander... but\n             you knew him as Arthur Denker, right?\n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah.  I never knew of that other name till I\n             saw it in the paper.\n\n                          RICHLER\n             How did you know him?  \n\n     Todd starts to rub his stomach.\n\n                          TODD\n             I met him at the movies.  Last summer.  ...He\n             asked me where to pick up the number seven\n             bus.  He said his eyes weren't too good.\n             ...Will you excuse me for a minute?  \n\n     He gets up before Richler can answer walks toward the stairs.  \n\n                          MONICA\n             You okay, honey?  \n\n                          TODD \n             I just gotta use the bathroom.  I'll be right\n             back.  \n\n     He vanishes up the stairs.  They all watch him go.  Monica turns\n     to Richler.\n\n                          MONICA \n             He's not feeling well.  \n\n     ANGLE on Dick.\n\n                          MONICA (CONT'D)\n             Can I get you some coffee?  \n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY\n\n     The faucet runs at full blast to hide the noise as Todd digs \n     through the medicine cabinet and takes out a bottle of Pepto-\n     Bismol.  He takes off the cap and gulps down what is left in the\n     bottle.  He finishes and takes a few deep breaths.  \n\n     As he turns around he catches his reflection in the mirror.  An\n     empty bottle in his hand, a bright pink ring around his lips, a \n     few pink splotches down his shirt-- he looks totally ridiculous.\n     Todd can't help but laugh.  \n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     The interview continues.  The clock ticks on.  Richler drinks\n     from a coffeee cup.  Todd is back in his seat.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Todd, let me tell you what we're really \n             interested in here.  You told the admitting \n             nurse that Denker had a heart attack while \n             you were reading him a letter.\n\n                          TODD \n             That's right.  I was.  That's what I was\n             doing there.  It was in German but he \n             insisted I try to read it anyway.  Once or\n             twice he got pissy about the pronunciation \n             but I asked him what did he want from me.  I\n             don't speak German.  Mr. Denker...\n             Dussander... got really excited at one point.\n             He yelled out, \"Yes, that's what you would do\n             all right.\" but I didn't know what he was \n             talking about.  Then he grabbed his chest.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             And that's when you called the ambulance,\n             right?\n\n                          TODD\n             That's right.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Well, this is the part we can't figure out.\n             The letter itself, Todd... do you remember\n             what happened to it?  \n\n                          TODD \n             I guess it was still on the table.  I\n             couldn't swear to it, but --\n\n                          DICK \n             Wait, I saw a letter.  It was in German.  I\n             didn't think anything of it at the time.\n             But, yeah, it was on Airmail stationery.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Then it should still be there.  This is our\n             problem.  \n\n                          DICK\n             It isn't?  \n\n                          RICHLER\n             No.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             Maybe somebody broke in.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Why would somebody break into his house \n             simply to steal a letter? ...Unless... there\n             was someone... someone right here in Santo\n             Donato who would want to protect him for some \n             reason.  Maybe a close friend, or even \n             another fugitive.  I know it sounds like a\n             bunch of Robert Ludlum stuff, but when\n             Dussander was taken to the hospital, we think\n             our Mr. X scooted over to the house and\n             swiped the letter.  \n\n                          TODD \n             That doesn't make sense.  \n\n                          RICHLER\n             Why not, Todd?  \n\n                          TODD \n             Well, if Denk... if he had an old Nazi buddy\n             in town, why didn't he come over himself and\n             read the letter to him?  If you could have \n             heard the way he corrected me at every word--\n\n                          RICHLER \n             A good point.  Except maybe this other fellow \n             is in a wheelchair, or blind.  \n\n                          TODD\n             Guys that are blind don't normally go\n             scooting out to steal letters.\n\n                          RICHLER\n                    (smiling) \n             True.  Did Dussander have any friends that\n             you knew of?  \n\n                          TODD\n             No, not really.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             How about phone calls?  \n\n     Pause.  \n\n                          TODD \n             No, I heard his phone ring maybe five or six\n             times in all the time I knew him.  It was\n             never anything out of the ordinary.\n             Salesmen.  Wrong numbers.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Did you ever hear him speak German on those\n             occasions?  \n\n                          TODD\n             No.  He hardly ever spoke German.  He always\n             said he would teach me someday, but he never \n             got around to it.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF \n             Did he ever talk about his past?  \n\n     Todd looks at Weiskopf.  This is the first question he has asked\n     and Todd is more wary of him than of Richler.  Todd shrugs\n     innocently.\n\n                          TODD \n             Not really.  Little bits, I guess.  \n\n                          MONICA \n             Well, don't you remember what he told us at\n             Thanksgiving?\n\n     Todd looks at her.  \n\n                          MONICA (CONT'D)\n             He said he was in college-- \n\n                          DICK \n                    (shutting her up) \n             Monica.  They don't care what we know, they\n             care what Todd knows.  \n\n     Silence.  Richler notices the tension in the room.  He looks at\n     Weiskopf.  Finally, he speaks to Dick.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Look, I'm sure this whole thing has come as a\n             terrible shock.  I think we've done enough\n             for the day.  \n\n     He and Weiskopf stand.  Dick is almost surprised that they are\n     leaving so soon.  \n\n                          WEISKOPF \n             Thank you, Todd.  Mr. and Mrs. Bowden.  \n\n     Weiskopf nods good-bye.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Wait a minute... Agent Richler, before you \n             go--  Todd's not a suspect in this, is he?  I\n             mean he's just talking to you, right?  \n\n                          RICHLER\n             That's right.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Because Todd always thought he was helping \n             that old man.  We didn't know any of this\n             before today.  \n\n                          RICHLER \n             Mr. Bowden, you and Todd have nothing to \n             worry about.  I assure you.  Your son has \n             been a great service to us.  Thank you, Todd.\n             For now that's all we need.  Our next step is\n             to turn that house upside down.  We're\n             bringing in some special teams to look \n             through everything.  We may come up with \n             something.  We'll be in touch if we need you.  \n\n     They are almost to the door, when Richler stops.  \n\n                          RICHLER (CONT'D)\n             Oh, Todd, by the way....\n                    (casually, pulls a photo out of a\n                    folder he is carrying) \n             Have you ever seen this man before?  \n\n     He holds the photo up to Todd.  It is a picture of Archie in\n     military dress, probably a blow-up of his military ID.  Todd\n     stares at it for a moment.  His face shows no reaction.\n\n                          TODD\n             No.  \n\n                          RICHLER\n             Okay, thanks.  \n\n     He smiles.  Weiskopf opens the door and the two men leave.  \n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     From his window Todd sees Richler and Weiskopf talking by their\n     gray sedan.  \n\n                          TODD \n             You'll be back, won't you boys?  Won't you,\n             Special agent Jackoff.  You and the sheeny \n             professor. ...I know, let's show him an old\n             army picture, that'll screw him up. ...Fuck\n             you.  Fuck-You.\n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     Dick is half-way up the stairs when he hears yelling coming from\n     Todd's room.  He pauses a moment.  Most of Todd's words aren't\n     clear, but the profanity sure is...  \n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - TODD'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     After a moment, the sedan pulls away.  Todd turns away from the\n     window and we see that he is holding the barrel of the rifle in \n     one hand and the scope in the other.  \n\n     He takes a few breaths, tries to calm down.  A burst of nervous\n     laughter slips out of him.  \n\n     There is a KNOCK at the door.  Two seconds later Dick comes in.  \n\n     DICK'S POV: Todd stands in the middle of his room.  The gun\n     pieces are nowhere in sight.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Everything all right, son?  \n\n                          TODD\n             Yeah... fine.  \n\n                          DICK \n             You sure?  \n\n                          TODD\n             I'm fine, Dad.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Your mother and I feel terrible... like we...  \n\n                          TODD \n             It's not your fault.  \n\n     Dick grabs his son and pulls him close.  Todd doesn't know how\n     to respond.  For Dick, it is like hugging a phone pole.  He \n     knows something is terribly wrong.  Todd stands stiff in his\n     father's arms until he releases him.  \n\n                          DICK \n             You know we love you, don't you?  \n\n                          TODD\n             I know, Dad.  \n\n     He smiles at his father, comfortingly.  Dick is not comforted.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Look, ahh, your mother and I are going to go\n             down and talk to our lawyer.  I don't want\n             you to worry about a thing.  It's just a \n             precaution.  I don't trust these cops.  We're\n             not going to be gone long.\n\n                          TODD \n             Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.  \n\n                          DICK \n             Your old man is on top of things, all right?\n             I am going to take care of this.  \n\n                          TODD\n             I know, Dad.  \n\n     Dick kisses Todd's forehead.  He turns to leave and stops.  \n\n                          DICK \n             This afternoon, if you're up for it, we'll go\n             do something.  How 'bout it?  \n\n                          TODD\n             Sure.  \n\n     Dick tries to smile and goes out, the door, leaving Todd alone.\n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     The garage door opens and Dick backs the Porsche into the\n     street.  Monica is with him.  Todd, from the upstairs window, \n     watches them go.  \n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY\n\n     Todd is near the end of his rope, trying to hold himself\n     together.  We see him splashing water on his face in the \n     bathroom.  He gazes into the mirror, transfixed by the ghost- \n     like image reflected back at him.  Todd pounds his fist against\n     the sink.  He can stand it no longer.  He darts out of the\n     bathroom.  \n\n\n     EXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - DAY\n\n     Todd drives his mother's Honda wagon towards the entrance of the\n     hospital and for the first time witnesses the scope of\n     Dussander's discovery.  News vans are everywhere.  The \n     protesters have grown in number.  A line of cars wait for \n     admittance into the parking lot.  A policeman stands a few feet\n     away from Todd, directing cars in, turning others away.  He is\n     moving toward Todd.  Horns honk around him.  Todd sees that more\n     police officers are standing by the door of the hospital.  The\n     nearby policeman notices Todd and walks closer.  Todd doesn't\n     wait.  He pulls the car out of line and drives off.\n\n\n     INT. HONDA WAGON - DAY\n\n     Todd holds the steering wheel with a white-knuckled grip.  His \n     face is sweaty and flushed.  He rocks back and forth as he tries\n     to reassure himself...  \n\n                          TODD \n             We're okay.  We're okay.  We're o-kay.\n\n     He is almost calm when he nears his house.  But it doesn't last.\n     He sees something he can hardly believe.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             You got to be fucking kidding me.\n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     An old Vo1vo is parked on the street in front of the house.\n     Standing on the porch, sneakers and all, is Ed French.  Todd \n     pulls into the driveway and gets out.  French has a cautious air\n     about him as he walks toward Todd.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             Hello, Todd.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Mr. French, what brings you to the wild side\n             of town?  \n\n     The two of them are standing on opposites sides of the car.  \n     French pulls a folded newspaper page from his pocket.  He starts\n     to move around the car toward Todd, but Todd circles the other\n     way, keeping the car in between himself and French.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Todd... I found something troubling in the\n             morning news.  Are your parents home?  \n\n                          TODD\n             No.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I know the man in this picture is the man who\n             came to see me.  \n\n                          TODD \n             It's sort of a bad time right now.  Why don't\n             you go home?  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             I will.  But first I need a couple of things\n             explained to me.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - OUTSIDE DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     Richler is speaking to the reporters.  Cameras and lights are in\n     his face.  His words are low, serving as a backdrop, but we can \n     tell that he is telling them of the plans to relocate Dussander.\n     Weiskopf stands close by...  \n\n                          FRENCH (V.O.) \n             Todd, why don't you tell me what happened?  \n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     While Todd almost seems to be enjoying this odd dance around the\n     car, French does not.  \n\n                          TODD \n             You know, Mr. French, sometimes one thing\n             just leads to another and before you know \n             it... things get out of control.\n\n                          FRENCH \n             I'm afraid that's not much of an answer, \n             Todd.  When do you expect your parents home?  \n\n                          TODD \n             I don't know, Ed.  You want to come in and \n             wait?  I'll put on a pot of tea.  We'll talk\n             about old times.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             I think you might need some help, Todd.\n             That's why I'm here.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     Dussander is alone in the room as Richler addresses the \n     reporters outside.  His eyes open wide and his movements are the\n     liveliest they have been since he was discovered.  He reaches \n     over to his IV unit and begins to disconnect the tube from the\n     bag...\n\n                          TODD (V.O.) \n             You know?  You're right.  I do need help.  I\n             really do.  \n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     Todd becomes more animated, more threatening with every word.\n     Somehow it is as though French is now retreating from Todd as\n     they circle the car.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Let me help you, Todd.  I want to.  You're\n             too smart to do anything crazy.\n\n                          TODD \n             Can I ask you something, Ed?  You don't mind\n             if I call you Ed, now that I'm out of your\n             fucking school, do you?  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             What?  \n\n                          TODD \n             You know all this crap you see on TV about\n             forensics... hairs and fibers, that stuff?  \n             How much of it do think is true and how much\n             is just bullshit?  \n\n     French is puzzled by the question.  He has no answer.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D)\n             Oh, how would you know?  You're a fucking\n             guidance counsellor.\n\n     French stops.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Todd, this is silly.  Why don't we go inside?  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     Liquid spills onto the floor as the tube comes loose from the\n     bag.  Dussander sits back and pulls the free end of the tube up\n     to his mouth.  His lips wrap around it and his face tightens as \n     he begins to blow....\n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     Todd starts moving again.  French does the same.  \n\n                          TODD \n             Here's a little factoid for ya.  I'll bet you\n             didn't know this one.  Hairs fall out of your\n             head all the time.  But it's even worse when\n             you're nervous.  And you know what?  I've\n             been real fucking high-strung lately.  \n\n     Todd comes around the rear of the car and stops at the door to\n     the back seat.  He opens it.  \n\n                          FRENCH \n             Listen, Todd... Please.  \n\n     Todd bends down to get something from the back seat.  His voice\n     is muffled from the inside of the car.\n\n                          TODD \n             That's how it all happened, you know.  One \n             thing lead to another and before I knew it...\n\n     Todd pops back up holding the rifle, fully assembled and aimed\n     at French's chest.  \n\n                          TODD (CONT'D) \n             ...you showed up in my driveway, wearing\n             those same fucking sneakers.  \n\n                          FRENCH\n             Whoa.  To--\n\n     Todd rapid-fires.  French's chest explodes red as his lifeless\n     body sails back onto the grass.  In the front yard, a dozen\n     birds evacuate a tree in a panicked exodus.  Todd swoons back on\n     his heels, overcome by something.  But it isn't pain, rather,\n     it's a rush of pleasure.  A laugh slips out.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     Dussander takes the tube from his mouth and lets it fall to the\n     floor.  The camera moves along the tube and stops at Dussander's\n     arm, where it ends.  He lies back in his bed and waits...\n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY\n\n     Todd regains his balance.  French stares wide-eyed as Todd steps\n     up to him, the muzzle aimed at French's head.  Todd grins\n     widely.  For the first time he looks ...happy.\n\n     A single round obliterates half of French's skull.  Todd chokes\n     back a giggle like a drunk chokes back a belch.  \n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     Dussander lurches up in the bed in a spastic, contortive fit as\n     the air embolism reaches his heart.  His arm flails against the \n     IV unit, sending it crashing to the floor.  The monitors next to\n     him reflect a drastic turn in his condition.  The door flies\n     open and a pair of nurses charae in through the swarm of \n     journalists.  Richler and Weiskopf run in and the eager \n     cameramen follow.  The room is bathed in flash explosions as the\n     nurses try to subdue Dussander.\n\n\n     INT. BOWDEN HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY\n\n     Todd throws open a cabinet door above the workbench and eyes the\n     boxes and boxes of ammunition.  He lets out a beautifully wicked\n     laugh as he dumps all of the cartons into his backpack.  He\n     leaves the cabinet door open as he slips the bag over his\n     shoulder.\n\n\n     EXT. BOWDEN HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - STREET - DAY\n\n     Todd zooms out of the garage on his bike, the rifle slung over\n     one shoulder, the backpack over the other.  He zips past\n     French's body and out into the street.  In the distance, we hear\n     the faint, but rising wail of sirens.  \n\n     A front door or two slams shut as Todd passes.  Suddenly he cuts\n     up between two houses.  A man standing in his back yard sees \n     Todd and freezes.  Todd ignores him.  He steers the bike through\n     the yard and picks up the dirt path he has used so many times \n     before.\n\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - DUSSANDER'S ROOM - DAY\n\n     From above we see Dussander's eyes, wide open, motionless.  Yet \n     the expression on his face is one of odd satisfaction.  A doctor\n     pounds on his chest, barks orders.  The trauma team prepares the\n     defibrillator, but we know they are too late...\n\n\n     EXT. DIRT PATH - DAY\n\n     Todd rides fast over the dry, rocky ground.  The wind streaks\n     back his hair.  His excitement is as palpable as the grin\n     dancing across his face.  \n\n     An aerial shot follows him as he angles the bike off the trail \n     and up a steep embankment.  As the camera moves ahead of him, we\n     see the crest of the hill, and beyond it...  \n\n     The freeway, teeming with rush-hour traffic.  \n\n     BLACK.\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApt Pupil\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Brandon Boyce\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:37.266142"}
