Compelled \n               to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel \n               drive.\n\n               She stops. Silence. She is alone.\n\n               An intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut.

Her \n               hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief.\n\n               Her shoulders shudder.\n\n               Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly -- \n               a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning \n               sensation that consumes her.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Shit.\n\n               Tears come to her.

The familiar burning.\n\n               She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees. \n               The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (shaking her head)\n                         Mm-mm\n                              (meaning \"no\")\n                         Mm-mm...

Her skin is deathly white, \n               her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen.\n\n               Lazarus carefully steps toward her.

With a twist of the valve the \n               radiator moans to life.\n\n               Laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face.

LAZARUS' HOME - DAY\n\n               Snot and spittle has run down the side of Rae's face -- her \n               eyelids stick together as she tries to open them.\n\n               There is a creak, followed by another. Rae has become aware \n               that someone is slowly walking up the front porch.\n\n               The door opens. Silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a \n               white man in his 40's. His face is indistinguishable to Rae's \n               affected gaze.\n\n               Is this a dream?\n\n               He stands above her and lights a cigarette. The Zippo lighter \n               clasps shut. The man lowers it to his side where Rae can see \n               it clearly. A bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight \n               that makes Rae's eyes open wide in horror.\n\n               Her breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea. This is no dream -- \n               it's a nightmare.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Mm-mm... Mm-mm...\n\n               A massive hand slaps down over her mouth. Her crusted eyes \n               peer above the hairy knuckles. He sucks on the cigarette. A \n               red cherry blazes at the end. The man pushes the blanket off \n               of her and grips her panties.\n\n               Rae's eyes close. She knows what is next. In his clenched \n               fist, the panties are ripped off.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         NOOOOO!\n\n               Rae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and falls \n               to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat. Weakened and shaking, \n               she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen. Her \n               hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Laz's guitar on \n               the floor. She grips the steel strings with her trembling \n               fingers.\n\n               A single bass note twangs as she passes out.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

MACON DRUGS - AFTERNOON\n\n               Laz opens his truck door and stops. At the pool-hall across \n               the square, Laz sees a green Cutlass with chrome rims.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

He crosses to the back pool table as \n               Tehronne sinks the 8. Tehronne looks at his friend.\n\n                                     TEHRONNE\n                         Do you call it a game when only one \n                         man win each time?

What he sees \n               chills him to the bone.\n\n               Rae is writhing on the floor as if she is possessed -- a \n               rant of raspy words pour from her mouth.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         ...you don't... touch me... s'no... \n                         NO!

His weathered Bible lies in a coat of dust. He picks \n               it up as a wave of the burning hits Rae.\n\n               She clutches her breast and crotch, rolling from side to \n               side.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Mm-mm... mm-mm...

Her \n               eyes remain closed, her face drenched with sweat.

She struggles to breathe, she almost faints.\n\n               She finds a soldier face down. With all her strength she \n               turns him over. It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless.\n\n               An awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow.

He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her \n               balance betrays her.\n\n               Laz wraps his arms around her.

She backs away -- the chain scrapes across the floor.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         You some kind'a pervert?\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         No ma'am.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck \n                         the spirit into me...\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         In my house, you watch that lip...\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (furious, near tears)\n                         Look it, mister... you wanna have \n                         your way, you take it.

Laz falls back \n               against the side table by the couch, toppling the lamp.\n\n               EXT. LAZARUS' HOME / INT. LAZARUS' HOME - AFTERNOON\n\n               The door slams against the house as Rae rushes out in her \n               wolf shirt and panties -- the chain trailing behind her.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (screaming)\n                         HELP!\n\n               Laz watches as the coil unravels and snaps taut, yanking on \n               the old radiator.\n\n               Clank! The chain whips Rae down to the ground. Laz watches \n               as dust flies of the radiator with each tug.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         SOMEBODY!\n\n               CLANK!\n\n               The fear in Laz's face is replaced with a grin as he watches \n               his radiator hold firm.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         SOMEBODY HELP ME!\n\n               Outside, Rae bucks and screams, yanking on the chain like a \n               wild mustang. Her bare feet and legs are soiled with fresh \n               mud and grass as she claws at the ground.\n\n               Laz crosses to the radiator and pats it like a proud parent -- \n               his wedding ring clicks against the iron.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (to the radiator)\n                         Ain't gonna be moved.\n\n               He steps outside with resolve and strength.

I ain't gonna be moved on this!\n\n               Laz yanks her back, dragging her towards him. He grips the \n               taut chain with his other hand and yanks her closer.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         LET ME GO!\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         You can holla y'self hoarse.

LAZARUS'S HOME - LATER THAT AFTERNOON\n\n               Rae is screaming and grunting as Laz, standing in his kitchen, \n               tugs on the chain around the door-jam like he's drawing water \n               from a well.\n\n               Outside Rae struggles to hold onto the porch post. Laz pulls \n               hard, lifting her lower torso off the ground.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Stop it! Stop it!

Rae loses her grip and slams onto the porch.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Okay... OKAY! I'M COMIN' IN! NOW \n                         QUIT IT!\n\n               The pulling stops. Rae picks herself up. Her knees and hands \n               are scraped and bleeding. The two stare at each other.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Say we talk. Just take a seat on the \n                         sofa. I'll get us somethin' cool to \n                         drink.\n\n               Laz crosses to the kitchen. Rae sits down on the couch, \n               noticing the fallen lamp on the floor.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         You may not remember.

He crosses into the \n               front room. Rae is not there.\n\n               CRASH! Rae smashes the lamp on Laz's head. The water glasses \n               shatter as Laz falls to the floor.\n\n               Rae picks up a wooden chair and breaks it over his back. \n               Before she can do any more damage, Laz grabs her by the wrists \n               and throws her to the couch.\n\n               Rae falls to the floor. Laz stumbles on his feet as he \n               clutches his bleeding head. He loses his cool.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Wicked little bitch... gonna cut \n                         me...\n\n                                     RAE\n                         You gonna get a lot more a'that, you \n                         keep me locked up like this!\n\n               Rae freezes as she sees Laz undo his belt buckle. Her breath \n               starts to quiver as she deeply inhales and exhales.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Think I'm gonna let you do me like \n                         that...\n\n               Laz whips his belt off and wraps the buckle around his fist.\n\n               He stops in his tracks. Rae is panting and shaking. Her middle \n               finger is scratching at her own thigh.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (regaining his cool)\n                         Okay, now...

Her hands wander down to her inner \n               thighs.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         No, ma'am.

She rests the top of her head on the floor \n               and sways back and forth. Laz rushes out the front door.\n\n               As the wave hits, Rae twists and turns, wrapping the chain \n               around her. She grips the radiator with both hands and rests \n               her face against the side.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Hmmmmmm... Stop-it!... STOP-IT!\n\n               The wave is about to build in to a powerful climax. Rae gasps \n               for breath.\n\n               The door slams open. Laz drenches her with a gallon of cold \n               well water from a tin bucket. Rae inhales and freezes. Laz \n               waits and watches.\n\n               The burning is gone.\n\n               Laz kneels next to her and gently frees her bare ankle from \n               the tangled chain.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         You hungry?\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. LAZARUS' HOME - ON THE PORCH - LATER THAT DAY\n\n               They are both seated on the front porch with paper plates in \n               their laps. Laz watches with amusement as Rae tears into her \n               chicken and gobbles up the vegetables.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         I put some back ache into growin' \n                         them greens.

She takes a \n               step to her left, walking through the parallel rows of squash.\n\n               The chain gently rattles behind her. Laz has given her about \n               20 feet of slack. He holds the chain tight around his fist.\n\n               Rae grins, standing proud in her wolf shirt and panties.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         You like this?

Continues playing.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Come a day, Rose say she had to go \n                         visit her folks in Jackson. Didn't \n                         want me to come... so I stayed put.\n                              (remembers)\n                         When she come back...\n                              (hesitates)\n                         They talk about a woman havin' that \n                         glow. Couldn't see it no more. She... \n                         took it away. Cut it out.\n\n               The guitar's song turns dark. Laz slides his fingers up the \n               guitar strings, lingering on low growns.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         One night... While she sleepin'. \n                         Held a pillow in my hands. I could \n                         see myself killin' her. What evil in \n                         my heart make me wanna kill her, I \n                         don't know? It's that voice in me. \n                         Each time I think it's gone, he come \n                         howlin' back. Devil or no, I don't \n                         know. But I am a haunted man.\n\n               Fear spreads across Rae's face. Laz is talking about something \n               all too familiar.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Calls me when I'm ailing. When I \n                         can't find my home, lost in the pines. \n                         I calls it the Black Snake Moan.\n                              (he closes his eyes \n                              and sings)\n                         Mm-mm...

He sways back and forth with his eyes closed. Rae \n               hears the swell of the cicadas. Her eyes dart to the front \n               door as the familiar creek of footsteps are heard.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Sing, Lazarus.\n                              (kneels next to him \n                              in fear)\n                         Please keep singin'.\n\n               The door swings open. A white calloused hand appears around \n               Rae's mouth.\n\n               She gasps in terror, clutching Laz's leg. The white hand is \n               gone. Tears come to her. She trembles as Laz sings.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (singing)\n                         Mm-mm...

Rae raises up to her knees, facing \n               Laz. Tears have run down his dried face. He opens his eyes.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         My life is gone. Only life I was \n                         livin'. And I lost it.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         I'm here with you.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         I had love in my heart. And I gave \n                         it to one woman. And she gone now.\n                              (his lip quivers)\n                         Where am I gonna put all this love?\n\n               Rae gently touches his cheek. The wind picks up outside.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         You can give it to me.\n\n               Rae kisses Laz. He is motionless at first, allowing it to \n               happen. His hand moves from the neck of his guitar to the \n               bend in her neck.\n\n               The passion intensifies as they squeeze the guitar between \n               them.\n\n               Laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands. \n               They are so close, they are breathing into each other's \n               mouths.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         You can't start this and not finish. \n                         Not with me.\n                              (kisses him)\n                         Please...\n\n               The guitar clangs to the floor as Laz lifts Rae in his arms. \n               They kiss, ravenous for each other. He knocks up against the \n               side table, causing his Bible to fall to the floor, face up \n               and open. The wind pushes the front door open, slamming it \n               hard against the wall.\n\n               They turn together, kissing, Laz slowly spinning with Rae in \n               his arms. But Laz is soon distracted by the pages of his \n               Bible fluttering on the floor. The wind is blowing the pages, \n               turning them with an unseen hand.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Wait...

GET OFF!\n\n               It takes a considerable effort to pull Rae away. She falls \n               to the floor, dizzy and sucking in air.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         This ain't the way for me. I'm sorry.\n\n               Rae is struggling for breath. She desperately grabs at Laz.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Not gonna lie to you, Laz...\n                              (labored breath)\n                         This one's a doozy. I don't think... \n                         I don't think I can stop this.\n\n               Her eyes roll back briefly, almost losing consciousness. Laz \n               catches her and holds her tightly.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Tell me what to do.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (Barely able to speak)\n                         The... chain helps.\n\n               Laz grips the chain and wraps it around Rae.\n\n               As the burning increases. Laz holds Rae tight across his \n               lap, his back up against the radiator.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         I seen a man die.

The wave is \n               hitting her hard. Laz holds her face up to him.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (like a little girl)\n                         Oh, Laz... he hurt me.

Laz holds her.\n\n               Rae's open mouth quivers as the sensation peaks. Her shoulders \n               slump, her chest vibrates.

But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard \n               behind her. She stops and turns toward the truck. The sound \n               is gone.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Nothin'.\n\n               They go inside.\n\n               Ronnie's hand appears from under the blue tarp in the back \n               of Laz's truck. He pulls himself out and looks around.\n\n               INT. BOJO'S - NIGHT\n\n               Laz and Rae stand like strangers by the door. The place is \n               wall to wall -- people at the bar, people playing pool.\n\n               Laz sees the culprit of this show. R.L. is gabbing with Bojo, \n               a beer in his hand.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Get'chu at that table up yonder.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         By myself?\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         You can handle it.\n\n               As Rae makes her way through the crowd of people, Laz marches \n               over to R.L.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         The hell is this shit?\n\n                                     R.L.\n                         What?

Ya \n                         both called everybody, didn't ya?\n\n               Bojo turns away to another customer. R.L. grins as he removes \n               a flask. He offers it to Laz. Laz snaps it away.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         There you go, preacher man. Get me \n                         drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo \n                         ass.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                         I just know how you get. Good to \n                         know, them butterflies still in ya \n                         gut.\n\n               Laz and R.L. look over at Rae seated alone at a small table \n               near the stage.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                         Heard about this morning.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         We ain't here to talk about that \n                         shit.\n\n               Laz surprises R.L. by walking away and up onto the stage.\n\n               Rae watches as Laz, shakes hands with some of the band \n               members. A few whistles from the crowd.\n\n               Laz sits down at a chair off to the right of a short mic \n               stand.\n\n               He plugs in.\n\n               Rae watches curiously as Laz tunes his guitar -- moans of \n               electric distortion.\n\n               R.L. sits next to her.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                         You in for it, now. He gonna nail it \n                         to the wall tonight. I done pissed \n                         him off.\n\n               The drummer kicks in. Laz tears into the strings. The entire \n               place begins to undulate and bounce as Laz returns to the \n               blues.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (singing)\n                         I don't know, but I been around, \n                         tell me them women shake 'em on down.\n\n               Cheers. Rae watches in awe. She's never seen anything like \n               it. She is surrounded by couples dancing so close they might \n               as well be naked. But there is also a great sense of safety \n               as Laz controls the room with his music.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (singing)\n                         Yes, I'm goin' Georgia line. \n                         See if them women sweet like mine.\n\n               HERSHEL, a black man in his 30's, asks Rae to dance.\n\n                                     HERSHEL\n                         You wanna cut it up, baby?\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (shrugging)\n                         Well...\n\n               Rae looks up at Laz. Laz smiles and nods. Rae takes the man's \n               hand and moves out onto the dance floor. R.L. can't be seated \n               anymore. He stands and stomps his foot.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                              (shouting at Laz)\n                         Yeah, you know you home, old man. \n                         You just walked through the door.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (singing)\n                         I don't know, but I been told, them \n                         Georgia women sweet jelly roll.\n\n               Rae allows Laz's voice and guitar to take hold of her. Her \n               face gets wet with sweat as she moves, making love to the \n               current in the air.\n\n               Men are dancing all around her, but now she is in control. \n               She turns to a young man and shakes, then an old man.\n\n               She is free, herself, and above all, safe.\n\n               Laz smiles, unaware of Ronnie watching from the window behind \n               him. There is rage and confusion in his face as he watches \n               Rae surrounded by dancing limbs.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. LAZARUS' HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Both Laz and Rae are drinking water from the sink in tall \n               glasses like they've been stranded in a desert.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Are you drunk?\n                              (Laz shrugs)\n                         Keep drinkin' water and you won't \n                         get a headache in the mornin'.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Yeah, gal I been here before.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (smiling)\n                         I guess you have.\n\n               INT. LAZARUS' HOME - THE BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Laz is taking off his shoes, getting ready to crash for the \n               night. He sits down on the side of his bed and takes off his \n               shirt, leaving his T-shirt on.\n\n               Rae is standing in his doorway.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Laz?

But you a grown \n                         girl. You can handle it. I got to.\n\n               Rae understands. She crosses to Laz and kisses him on the \n               cheek.\n\n               Rae then walks down the hall to her couch in the front room.\n\n               Laz turns off the light.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK\n\n               Rae enters the dark bathroom and shuts the door behind her. \n               Her hair is shorter, a shaggy bob, bleached platinum blond.\n\n               ARTY, always behind the door, attempts to enter, but Rae \n               pushes the door closed and locks it.\n\n                                     ARTY\n                         Baby, where you goin'?\n\n                                     RAE\n                         I'm gonna pee.

Cuz \n                         there won't be no more question in \n                         her mind. She with a real man now. A \n                         real KILLER!\n\n               A flood of tears are streaming down Ronnie's face. The gun \n               is shaking furiously in his hand.\n\n                                     RONNIE\n                         Don't... don't say that to me...\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                              (getting fed up)\n                         Son, I'm grown.

So let's have it. \n                         End me or get out of my face!\n\n               Ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma \n               attack. Laz barks at him one last time.\n\n                                     LAZARUS\n                         Go'on.

The gun lowers in his grasp. A low sob is \n               heard as he falls to his knees.\n\n               Laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         Ronnie?\n\n               Rae inches closer to Ronnie as he kneels over and weeps. She \n               gently touches his shoulder. He turns his anguished face to \n               her and tries to speak.\n\n                                     RONNIE\n                         I can't stop... I can't stop... being \n                         scared. What am I gonna do...\n\n               Ronnie hides his face in his hands. Rae throws her arms around \n               him and holds him tight.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         I got you, baby... I got you...\n\n               Laz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen. He slams \n               the gun on the sink, opens a drawer and removes the wall \n               phone.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (seeing Laz plug the \n                              phone in)\n                         What are you doing?\n                              (Laz dials a number)\n                         You gonna call the cops?

LAZARUS' HOME - NIGHT\n\n               R.L. crosses from the kitchen. He hands a glass of water to \n               Rae seated on the couch. He hands another to Ronnie seated \n               next to her. R.L. sits before them as Laz lingers in the \n               doorway.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                              (to Ronnie)\n                         I imagine there's a lot of good \n                         between you two.

Starts in my head. Then \n                         moves to my stomach. Then it goes \n                         lower. I can stop it sometimes but \n                         mostly I just jump on and ride it \n                         out... then everything'll go back to \n                         normal, you know.

When I can \n                         do that for him... it's like I'm \n                         givin' somethin' of myself that I \n                         haven't givin' nobody else.\n\n                                     R.L.\n                         Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him \n                         how you feel.\n\n               Rae turns to Ronnie. Her nose is running as she wipes away \n               her tears.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         I think...

But... that \n                         don't mean what I feel ain't true. \n                         It don't mean I can't love. And I \n                         know, how I been is... is... REALLY \n                         BAD! So if you want to quit on me... \n                         I understand.

My only sunshine. \n                         You make me happy, when times are \n                         gray.\n\n               Ronnie slowly turns and looks at Rae, his head still resting \n               on the steering wheel. The panting has slowed. Color starts \n               returning to his cheeks.\n\n                                     RAE\n                              (singing)\n                         You'll never know dear, how much I \n                         love you. \n                         Please don't take, my sunshine away.\n\n               The anxiety is gone. Ronnie takes a breath and looks at Rae, \n               humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him.\n\n                                     RAE\n                         See. We're okay.\n\n               Rae is smiling.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Snake Moan\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Craig Brewer\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:58.376375"}
