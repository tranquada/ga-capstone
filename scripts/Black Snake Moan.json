She tries to ignore it and the tension it brings.\n\n               She turns to see that Ronnie is sweating. Another truck is \n               on his side sandwiching them in. An attack is coming over \n               Ronnie.\n\n               His breath is short. His chest tightens.

The two trucks zoom ahead as Ronnie breaks to the \n               side. Dust flies as the Chevy skids to a stop on the side of \n               the road.\n\n               Trucks zip by shaking the car, as Ronnie tries to get control \n               of his breathing.\n\n               Rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he \n               struggles for breath.
