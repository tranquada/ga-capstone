And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...\r\n          .. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve\r\n          this painful puzzle.

Drops the rifle, looks down at\r\n          his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.\r\n          The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket.

Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and\r\n          trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means \"Don't\r\n          be an idiot.\" Jake glances over --\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          110.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         JAKE\r\n</b>          Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.\r\n\r\n<b>          (BARK, BARK)\r\n</b>          Go on, GET.\r\n          He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.\r\n          Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his\r\n          chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...\r\n          But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.\r\n          TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap\r\n          between them.\r\n          Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best\r\n          effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:\r\n\r\n<b>                         JAKE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Abilene happens to be on my way.\r\n          He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO\r\n          THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms\r\n          around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:\r\n\r\n<b>                         JAKE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Stop smiling, Goddammit.\r\n          He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye\r\n          look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:\r\n          The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the\r\n          canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF\r\n          DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:\r\n          ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The\r\n          THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...\r\n\r\n<b>          THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.\r\n</b>          Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a\r\n          nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI\r\n          As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and\r\n          Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...\r\n          Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.\r\n\r\n<b>          FADE OUT.\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Cowboys-&amp;-Aliens.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Alex Kurtzman\" title=\"Scripts by Alex Kurtzman\">Alex Kurtzman</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Roberto Orci\" title=\"Scripts by Roberto Orci\">Roberto Orci</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Damon Lindelof\" title=\"Scripts by Damon Lindelof\">Damon Lindelof</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Cowboys &amp; Aliens Script.html#comments\" title=\"Cowboys &amp; Aliens comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:02:44.390908"}
