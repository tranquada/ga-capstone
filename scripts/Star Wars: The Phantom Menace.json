The taxation of trade routes to\noutlaying star systems is in dispute.\nHoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships, the\ngreedy Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of\nNaboo.\nWhile the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of\nevents, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched two Jedi Knights,\nthe guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy, to settle the\nconflict.....\n\nPAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great\nspeed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe beautiful green planet of\nNaboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.\n\n<b>INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT\n</b>\n\nIn the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one\nof the battleships.\n\nQUI-GON : (off screen voice) Captain.\n\nThe Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.\n\nCAPTAIN : Yes, sir?\nQUI-GON : (V.O) Tell them we wish to board at once.\nCAPTAIN : Yes, sir.\n\nThe CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade\nviceroy, waits for a reply.\n\nCAPTAIN : (cont'd) With all due respect for the Trade Federation, the\nAmbassodors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.\nNUTE : Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you know, our blockade is perfectly\nlegal, and we'd be happy to recieve the Ambassador...Happy to.\n\nThe screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship\nlooms ever closer.\n\n<b>EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)\n</b>\nThe small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation\nbattleship.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE\n</b>\nA PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay. Two WORKER\nDROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.\n\nPK-4 : They must be important if the Viceroy sent one of those useless\nprotocol gearheads to greet them.\n\nThe door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay.\nTwo darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.\n\nTC-14 : I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.\n\nThey move off down the hallway.\n\nEG-9 : A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?\nPR-4 : I'm not made to think.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM\n</b>\nA door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the\nformal conference room by TC-14.\n\nTC-14 : I hope you honoured sirs with the most comfortable here. My master\nwill be with you shortly.\n\nThe droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He backs out the\ndoor and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window\nat the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white\nhair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is\ntwenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. Several\nexotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the door.\n\nOBI-WAN : I have a bad feeling about this.\nQUI-GON : I don't sense anything.\nOBI-WAN : It's not about the mission, Master, it's\nsomethging...elsewhere...elusive.\nQUI-GON : Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration\nhere and now where it belongs.\nOBI-WAN : Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...\nQUI-GON : .....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the\nliving Force, my young Padawan.\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with\nthe chancellor's demands?\nQUI-GON : These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be\nshort.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nNUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.\n\nNUTE : (shaken) What?!? What did you say?\nTC-14 : The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.\nDOFINE : I knew it! They were sent to force a settlement, eh. Blind me,\nwe're done for!\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY\n</b>\nA hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference\nroom hallway.\n\nNUTE : They must be dead by now. Blast, what's left of them.\n\nThe hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the\ndoor. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their\nweapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the\ntray of drinks.\n\nTC14 : Oh, excuse me, so sorry.\n\nThe PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing laser swords\nfly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several BATTLE DROIDS before they\ncan fire.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the\nviewscreen.\n\nOWO-1 : Not sure exactly what...\n\nOWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives NUTE a worried\nlook.\n\nNUTE : What in blazes is going on down there?\nRUNE : Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?\nNUTE : Well, not exactly, but I don't...(panicked) Seal off the bridge.\nRUNE : That won't be enough, sir.\n\nThe doors to the bridge SLAM shut.\n\nNUTE : I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!\nRUNE : We will not survive this.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\n</b>\nQUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and\nmetal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS\ncrashing into the wall.\n\nQUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nThe CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door.\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.\n\nNUTE : Close the blast doors!!!\n\nThe huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then\na third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs\nthe door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the\ncenter of the blast door.\n\nRUNE : ...They're still coming through!\n\nOn the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.\n\nNUTE : Impossible!! This is impossible!!\nRUNE : Where are those destroyer droids?!\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE\n</b>\nTen ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just\nbefore they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their\nbattle configuration. QUI-GON can't see them but senses their presence.\n\nQUI-GON : Destroyer droids!\nOBI-WAN : Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.\n\nThe WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three hallways,\nblasting away with their laser guns. They stop firing and stand in a\nsemi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be\nseen.\n\nP-59 : Switch to bio...There they are!\n\nThe Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the\ndoorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with\ntheir laser swords.\n\nOBI-WAN : They have shield generators!\nQUI-GON : It's a standoff! Let's go!\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nNUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL\nDROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.\n\nRUNE : We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer\ndroids.\nTEY HOW : Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY\n</b>\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are\ncareful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing\ncraft.\n\nQUI-GON : Battle droids.\nOBI-WAN : It's an invisible army.\nQUI-GON : It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the\nNaboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate\nships and meet down on the planet.\nOBI-WAN : You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were\nshort.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nTEY HOW recieves a transmission.\n\nTEY HOW : Sir, a transmission from the planet.\nRUNE : It's Queen Amidala herself.\nNUTE : At last we're getting results.\n\nOn the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her\nelaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING\nCOUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.\n\nNUTE : (cont'd) Again you come before me, Your highness. The Federation is\npleased.\nAMIDALA : You will not be pleased when you hear what I have to say,\nViceroy...Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.\n\nNUTE smirks at RUNE.\n\nNUTE : I was not aware of such a failure.\nAMIDALA : I have word that the Senate is finally voting on this blockade of\nyours.\nNUTE : I take it you know the outcome. I wonder why they bother to vote.\nAMIDALA : Enough of this pretense, Viceroy! I'm aware the Chancellor's\nAmbassadors are with you now, and that you have beencommanded to reach a\nsettlement.\nNUTE : I know nothing about any Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.\n\nAMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.\n\nAMIDALA : Beware, Viceroy....the Federation is going too far this time.\nNUTE : Your Highness, we would never do anything without the approval of\nthe Senate. You assume too much.\nAMIDALA : We will see.\n\nThe QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.\n\nRUNE : She's right, the Senate will never....\nNUTE : It's too late now.\nRUNE : Do you think she suspects an attack?\nNUTE : I don't know, but we must move quickly to disrupt all communications\ndown there.\n\n<b>INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM\n</b>\nThe QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a\nhologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.\n\nPALPATINE : ...How could that be true? I have assurances from the\nChancellor...his Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be\nthe...get...negotiate...\n\nThe hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.\n\nAMIDALA : Senator Palpatine?!? (turns to Panaka) What's happening?\n\nCAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT\n\nCAPT. PANAKA : Check the transmission generators...\nBIBBLE : A malfunction?\nCAPT. PANAKA : It could be the Federation jamming us. Your Highness.\nBIBBLE : A communications disruption can only mean one thing. Invasion.\nAMIDALA : Don't jump to conclusions, Governor. The Federation would not\ndare go that far.\nCAPT. PANAKA : The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be\nfinished.\nAMIDALA : We must continue to rely on negotiation.\nBIBBLE : Negotiation? We've lost all communications!...and where atre the\nChancellors Ambassadors? How can we negotiate? We must prepare to defend\nourselves.\nCAPT. PANAKA : This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security\nvolunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.\nAMIDALA : I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.\n\n<b>EXT. SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)\n</b>\nSix landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.\n\n<b>EXT. NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nThree landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the\nperpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation\nwarships land in the eerie swamp.\nOBI-WAN's head emerges from the mud of a shallow lake. For in the\nbackground, the activities of the invasion force can be seen in the mist.\nOBI-WAN takes several deep breaths, then dissapears again under the muddy\nswamp. Troop Transports (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft.\n\n<b>EXT. NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)\n</b>\nThe droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain.\nOOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the\nrolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.\n\nRUNE : ...and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotton onto one\nof your landing craft.\nOOM-9 : If they are down here, sir, we'll find them. We are moving out of\nthe swamp and are marching on the cities. We are meeting no resistance.\nNUTE : Excellent.\n\n<b>EXT. NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nQUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the\nmonstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist. Animals begin to run\npast him in a panic.\nAn odd, frog-like Gungan, JAR JAR INKS, squats holding a clam he has\nretrieved from the murky swamp. The shell pops open. JAR JAR's greta tongue\nsnaps out and grabs the clam, swallowing it in one gulp.\nJAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the\nwind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a\ncharging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam\nshell in one hand.\n\nJAR JAR : Oh, noooooooooo!\n\nJAR JAR drops the shell and grabs onto QUI-GON as he passes. The JEDI is\ncaught by surprise.\n\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Hey, help me! Help me!!\nQUI-GON : Let go!\n\nThe machine is about tp crush them as QUI-GON drags JAR JAR behind him.\nJust as the transport is about to hit them, QUI-GON drops, and JAR JAR goes\nsplat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.\nQUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the\nwar machine dissapear into the mist. JAR JAR grabs QUI-GON and hugs him.\n\nJAR JAR : Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!\n\nThe frog-like creature kisses the JEDI.\n\nQUI-GON : Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!\nJAR JAR : I spake.\nQUI-GON : The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta\nhere!\n\nQUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.\n\nJAR JAR : No...no! Mesa stay...Mesa yous humble servaunt.\nQUI-GON : That wont be necessary.\nJAR JAR : Oh boot tis! Tis demunded byda guds. Tis a live debett, tis. Mesa\nculled Jaja Binkss.\n\nIn the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing\n<b>OBI-WAN.\n</b>\nQUI-GON : I have no time for this now...\nJAR JAR : Say what?\n\nThe two STAPS barrell down on OBI-WAN.\n\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Oh, nooooo! Weesa ganna....\n\nQUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.\n\nQUI-GON : Stay down!\n\nHis head pops up.\n\nJAR JAR : ...dieeee!\n\nThe two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts\nback, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to\ncatch his breath.\n\nOBI-WAN : Sorry, Master, the water fried my weapon.\n\nOBI-WAN pulls out his burnt laser sword handle. QUI-GON inspects it, as JAR\nJAR pulls himself out of the mud.\n\nQUI-GON : You forgot to turn your power off again, didn't you?\n\nOBI-WAN nods sheeplishly.\n\nQUI-GON : (cont'd) It won't take long to recharge, but this is a lesson I\nhope you've learned, my young Padawan.\nOBI-WAN : Yes, Master.\nJAR JAR : Yousa sav-ed my again, hey?\nOBI-WAN : What's this?\nQUI-GON : A local. Let's go, before more of those droids show up.\nJAR JAR : Mure? Mure did you spake??!?\n\nOBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.\n\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Ex-squeeze me, but da moto grande safe place would be\nOtoh Gunga. Tis where I grew up...Tis safe city.\n\nThey all stop.\n\nQUI-GON : A city! (JAR JAR nods his head) Can you take us there?\nJAR JAR : Ahhh, will...on second taut...no, not willy.\nQUI-GON : No??!\nJAR JAR : Iss embarrissing, boot... My afrai my've bean banished. My\nforgoten der Bosses would do terrible tings to my. Terrible tings if my\ngoen back dare.\n\nA PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.\n\nQUI-GON : You hear that?\n\nJAR JAR shakes his head yes.\n\nQUI-GON : (cont'd) That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading\nthis way...\nOBI-WAN : When they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little\npieces, then blast us into oblivion!\nJAR JAR : Oh! Yousa point is well seen. Dis way! Hurry!\n\nJAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.\n\n<b>EXT. NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT\n</b>\nQUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR\ntries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.\n\nQUI-GON : Much farther?\nJAR JAR : Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?\n\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that\nturn into breathing masks.\n\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) My warning yous. Gungans no liken outlaunders. Don't\nexpict a wern welcome.\nOBI-WAN : Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.\n\nJAR JAR jumps, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the\nwater.\nBreath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him.\n\n<b>EXT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER\n</b>\nQUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the\nwater. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh\nGunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.\nThey approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically\nthrough one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and\nQUI-GON follow.\n\n<b>INT. OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE\n</b>\nGUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI. Four GUARDS\narmed with long electro-poles ride two-legged KAADUS into the square. The\nGUARDS, led by CAPTAIN TARPALS, point their lethal poles at the dripping\ntrio.\n\nJAR JAR : Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!\nCAPT. TARPALS : Noah gain, Jar Jar. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big\ndudu this time.\n\nCAPT. TARPALS gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps\nand moves off, followed by the two JEDI.\n\nJAR JAR : How wude.\n\n<b>INT. OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM\n</b>\nThe Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming\naround outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with\nGUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS\nNASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.\n\nBOSS NASS : Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new\nweesong!\nQUI-GON : That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.\nBOSS NASS : Wesa no like da Naboo! Un dey no like uss-ens.

I hope the punishment will not be\ntoo severe.\nBOSS NASS : Pounded unto death.\nJAR JAR : (grimacing) Oooooh...Ouch!\n\nOBI-WAN looks concerned. QUI-GON is thinking.\n\nQUI-GON : We need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. I have\nsaved Jar Jar Binks' life. He owes me what you call a \"life.debt.\"\nBOSS NASS : Binks.

The sub\nflies into the mouth of the creature.\n\nJAR JAR : Oooops.\nOBI-WAN : Give me the controls.\n\nOBI-WAN takes over the controls and the OPEE SEA KILLER instantly releases\nthe sub from its mouth.\n\nJAR JAR : Wesa free!\n\nAs the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the\nhapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The\nlights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the\ngloom.\n\nQUI-GON : There's always a bigger fish.\n\n<b>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE\n</b>\nNUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.\n\nNUTE : The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Good. I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. By the\ntime this incident comes up for a vote, they will have no choice but to\naccept your control of the system.\nNUTE : The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.\nDARTH SIDIOUS : Queen Amidala is yound and naive.

JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.\n\nOBI-WAN : You overdid it.\n\nThe COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub as it shoots out of the\ntunnel and into the waiting jaws of the SANDO AQUA MONSTER.\n\nOBI-WAN (cont'd) This is not good!\n\nJAR JAR regains consciousness.\nJAR JAR : Wesa dead yet?? Oie Boie!\n\nJAR JAR's eyes bulge, and he faints again. The sub narrowly avoids the\ndeadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so\nlucky.

THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)\n</b>\nAs the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport\ncarrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.\n\nNUTE : Ah, victory!\n\n<b>INT. NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)\n</b>\nThe little sub continue to propel itself toward the surface, which is\nbrightly lit.\n\nJAR JAR : Wesa dude it!\n\n<b>EXT. THEED - ESTUARY - DAY\n</b>\nParadise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD\nRUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.\nThe current in the estuary begins to pull the sub backward into a fast\nmoving river. OBI-WAN switches off the two remaining bubble canopies.\nQUI-GON stands up to look around. JAR JAR lets out a sigh of relief.\n\nJAR JAR : Wesa safe now.\nQUI-GON : Get this thing started.\nJAR JAR : Dissen berry good. Hey?\nOBI-WAN : What is it?\n\nJAR JAR looks back to where they're drifting. He sees they are headed for a\nhuge waterfall.\n\nJAR JAR : What!!?? Oie boie!\n\nOBI-WAN tries to start the engine. The long props behind the sub slowly\nbegin to rotate. OBI-WAN struggles until finally, a few feet short of the\nwaterfall, the sub starts and is able to generate enough power to stop\ndrifting backward in the powerful current. The sub slowly moves forward. In\nthe background, QUI-GON takes a cable out of his belt. The engine coughs\nand dies. They start drifting backward again. JAR JAR panics.\n\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Iyiiyi, wesa die'n here, hey!\n\nQUI-GON shoots the thin cable, and it wraps itself around a railing on the\nshore. The sub pulls the cable taut, and the little craft hangs\nprecariously over the edge of the waterfall.\n\nQUI-GON : Come on...\n\nOBI-WAN climbs out of the sub and pulls himself along the cable. QUI-GON\nstarts in after him.\n\nQUI-GON : (cont'd) Come on, Jar Jar.\nJAR JAR : No! Too scary!\nOBI-WAN : Get up here!\nJAR JAR : No a mighty no!\n\nJAR JAR looks back and sees he is hanging over the waterfall.\n\nJAR JAR : (cont'd) Oie boie...mesa comen. Mesa comen!\n\nJAR JAR starts to climb out of the sub. OBI-WAN is on shore and helps to\npull QUI-GON out of the water.\n\nOBI-WAN : That was close.\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : (O.S) Drop your weapons!\n\nThe TWO JEDI turn around to see a BATTLE DROID standing in front of them.\nJAR JAR climbs up on shore between the JEDI.\n\nBATTLE DROID 3B3 : I said drop your weapons\n\nQUI-GON ignites his laser sword, and in a brief flash, the DROID is cut\ndown by the JEDI. A stray laser bolt hits the cable and the sub breaks\nlose, crashing down the waterfall.\nThe JEDI move on. JAR JAR reluctantly follows and looks back at the mess.\n\nJAR JAR : Whoa!!!\n\n<b>EXT. THEED - PALACE - DAY\n</b>\nThe waterfalls of Theed sparkle in the noonday sun.\n\n<b>INT. THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nQUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE,\nPADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by TWENTY DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and\nFOUR NABOO GUARDS are also held at gunpoint. NUTE and RUNE stand in the\nmiddle of the room.\n\nBIBBLE : ...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?\nNUTE : The Naboo and the Federation will forge a treaty that will\nlegitimize our occupation here. I've been assured it will be ratified by\nthe Senate.\nAMIDALA : I will not co-operate.\nNUTE : Now, now, your Highness. You are not going to like what we have in\nstore for your people. In time, their suffering will persuade you to see\nour point of view. Commander. (OOM-9 steps forward) Process them.\nOOM-9 : Yes, sir!

The plaza\nis filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the\ndetention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak\nacross on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an\nattack to rescue the QUEEN.\n\nFOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are\nalso cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the\nDROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to\nQUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.\n\nJAR JAR : Yousa guys bombad!\n\nQUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this.\nThey move between two buildings.\n\nQUI-GON : Your Highness, we are the Ambassadors, for the Supreme\nChancellor.\nBIBBLE : Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.\nQUI-GON : The negotiations never took place. Your Highness, we must make\ncontact with the republic.\n\nCAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.\n\nCAPT. PANAKA : They've knocked out all our communications.\nQUI-GON : Do you have transports?\nCAPT.

They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE\nDROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.\n\nCAPT. PANAKA : There are too many of them.\nQUI-GON : That won't be a problem. (to Amidala) Your Highness, under the\ncircumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.\nAMIDALA : Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.\nQUI-GON : They will kill you if you stay.\nBIBBLE : They wouldn't dare.\nCAPT. PANAKA : They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of\ntheirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.\nQUI-GON : The situation here is not what it seems. There is something else\nbehind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move\nhere. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.\nBIBBLE : Please, Your Highness, reconsider. Our only hope is for the Senate\nto side with us... Senator Palpatine will need your help.\nCAPT. PANAKA : Getting past their blockade is impossible, Your Highness.\nAny attempt to escape will be dangerous.\nBIBBLE : Your Highness, I will stay here and do what I can...They will have\nto retain the Council of Governors in order to maintain control. But you\nmust leave...\n\nThe QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.\n\nAMIDALA : Either choice presents a great risk...to all of us...\nPADME : We are brave, Your Highness.\nQUI-GON : If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.\nAMIDALA : Then, I will plead our case before the Senate. (to Bibble) Be\ncareful, Governor.\n\n<b>INT. CENTRAL HANGER - DAY\n</b>\nThe door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN\nPANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE),\nfollowed\nby QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and\nSACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.\n\nCAPT. PANAKA : We need to free those pilots.\n\nCAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a\ncorner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.\n\nOBI-WAN : I'll take care of that. OBI-WAN heads toward the group of\ncaptured pilots.\n\nQUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP\napproach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.\n\nGUARD DROID : Where are you going?\nQUI-GON : I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking those\npeople to Coruscant.\nDROID GUARD : You're under arrest!\n\nThe DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire,\nthey are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid. OBI-WAN attacks the\nGUARDS around the PILOTS. QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS\nrush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC\nOLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. The OTHER\nPILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLR. After everyone has made it onto the\nship, QUI-GONjumps on board. ALARMS sound. MORE DROIDS rush into the hanger\nand fire as the ship takes off.\n\n<b>EXT.

JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five\nshort, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). The all look alike, except for\nthier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.\n\nJAR JAR : Ello, boyos. (no response) Disa wanna longo trip...hey?\n\nJAR JAR taps a bright red R-2 UNIT on the head, and its head pops up a bit.\nHe lets out a gasp as he lifts the head.\n\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Tis opens?...Oooops! Many springs and things come flying\nout.\n\nJAR JAR quickly closes it again, very embarrassed.\n\nJAR JAR : (Cont'd) Yoi! Just yoken!\nRIC OLIE : Powers back! That little droid did it. He bypassed the main\npower drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.\n\nThe lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The\nNaboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.\n\nRIC OLIE : There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive\nis leaking.\nQUI-GON : We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.\n\nQUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.\n\nOBI-WAN : Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The\nTrade Federation has no presence there.\nCAPT. PANAKA : How can you be sure?\nQUI-GON : It's controlled by the Hutts...\nCAPT. PANAKA : The Hutts??\nOBI-WAN : It's risky...but there's no alternative.\nCAPT. PANAKA : You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are\ngangsters... If they discovered her...\nQUI-GON : ...It would be no different than if we landed on a system\ncontrolled by the Federation...except the Hutts aren't looking for her,\nwhich gives us an advantage.\n\nCPATAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.\n\n<b>EXT.

There we will\nbe able to make needed repairs, then travel on to Coruscant.\nCAPTAIN PANAKA : Your Highness, Tatooine is very dangerous. It's controlled\nby an alliance of gangs called the Hutts. I do not agree with the Jedi on\nthis.\nQUI-GON : You must trust my judgement, Your Highness.\n\nAMIDALA and PADME exchange looks. PADME moves next to the DROID.\n\n<b>INT.

PADME is a\nlittle embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile.\nFinally, he gets the courage to speak.\n\nANAKIN : Are you an angel?\nPADME : What?\nANAKIN : An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They\nlive on the Moons of Iego I thimk. They are the most beautiful creatures in\nthe universe.

JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs\nhanging on a wire. He looks around to see if anyone is looknig, then sticks\nout his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth.\nUnfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly\nappears.\n\nVENDOR : Hey, that will be seven truguts!!\n\nJAR JAR opens his mouth in surprise, and the frog snaps away, ricochets\naround the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR\nmoves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the\nhapless Gungan.\n\nSEBULBA : (subtitled) Chuba!! (You!!) JAR JAR : Who, mesa?? SEBULBA :\n(subtitled) Ni chuba na?? (Is this yours??)\n\nSEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly. SEVERAL OTHER\nCREATURES start to gather. SEBULBA shoves JAR JAR to the ground. The Gungan\ndesperately tries to scramble to safety.\n\nJAR JAR : (to himself) Why mesa always da one??\nANAKIN : (V.O) Because you're afraid.\n\nJAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him.

How\nmight I serve you?\nPADME : He's perfect.\nANAKIN : When the storm is over, you can see my racer. I'm building a\nPodracer!\n\nPADME smiles at his enthusiasm.

ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nQUI-GON, ANAKIN, SHMI, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a makeshift\ntable, having dinner as the wind howls outside.\nJAR JAR slurps his soup rather loudly. Everyone looks at him. He turns a\nlittle brighter red.\n\nSHMI : All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.\nANAKIN : I've been working on a scanner to try and locate them, but no\nluck.\nSHMI : Any attempt to escape...\nANAKIN : ...and they blow you up...poof!\n\nPADME and JAR JAR are horrified.\n\nJAR JAR : How wude.\nPADME : I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The\nRepublic's anti-slavery laws...\nSHMI : The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.\n\nAn awkward silence. ANAKIN attempts to end the embarrassment.\n\nANAKIN : Have you ever seen a Podrace?\n\nPADME shakes her head no. She notices the concern of SHMI. JAR JAR snatches\nsome food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue.\nQUI-GON gives him a dirty look.\n\nQUI-GON : They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.\nANAKIN : I'm the only human who can do it.\n\nSHMI looks askance at her son.\n\nANAKIN : (Cont'd) Mom, what? I'm not bragging. It's true. Watto says he's\nnever heard of a human doing it.\nQUI-GON : You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.\n\nANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl\nwith his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and\nforefinger. JAR JAR is startled.\n\nQUI-GON : (Cont'd) Don't do that again.\n\nJAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of\nthe tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.\n\nANAKIN : I...I was wondering...something...\nQUI-GON : What?\nANAKIN : Well, ahhh...you're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?\nQUI-GON : What makes you think that?\nANAKIN : I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.\n\nQUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.\n\nQUI-GON : Perhaps I killed a Jedi and stole it from him.\nANAKIN : I don't think so... No one can kill a Jedi Knight.\nQUI-GON : I wish that were so...\nANAKIN. I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here and freed all the\nslaves...have you come to free us?\nQUI-GON : No, I'm afraid not...\nANAKIN : I think you have...why else would you be here?\n\nQUI-GON thinks for a moment.\n\nQUI-GON : I can see there's no fooling you...(leans forward) You mustn't\nlet anyone know about us...we're on our way to Coruscant, the central\nsystem in the Republic, on a very important mission, and it must be kept\nsecret.\nANAKIN : Coruscant...wow...how did you end up here in the outer rim?\nPADME : Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair\nit.\nANAKIN : I can help! I can fix anything!\nQUI-GON : I believe you can, but our first job is to aquire the parts we\nneed...\nJAR JAR : Wit no-nutten mula to trade.\nPADME : These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.\nSHMI : Gambling.

It's the fastest ever...There's a big race\ntomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod. It's all but finished...\nSHMI : Anakin, settle down. Watto won't let you...\nANAKIN : Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him\nthink it's your's, and you could get him to let me pilot it for you.\n\nQUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.\n\nSHMI : I don't want you to race, Annie...It's awful. I die every time Watto\nmakes you do it.\n\nANAKIN : But Mom, I love it...and they need help...they're in trouble. The\nprize money would more than pay for the parts they need. JAR JAR : Wesa ina\npitty bad goo.\nGUI-GON : Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who\nmight be able to help us?\n\nSHMI shakes her head no.\n\nANAKIN : We have to help them, Mom...you said that the biggest problem in\nthe universe is no one helps each other...\nSHMI : Anakin, don't...\n\nJAR JAR belches. There is silence for a moment as they eat.\n\nPADME : I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We will\nfind another way...\nSHMI : No, Annie's right, there is no other way...

JAR JAR sits on a box in front of Watto's parts\nshop, watching all the activity with growing nervousness. ARTOO is standing\nnext to him. PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.\n\nPADME : Are you sure about this?

Not on Republic credits, I think. (he laughs)\nQUI-GON : My ship will be the entry fee.\n\nQUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and\na hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of\nWATTO. He studies it.\n\nWATTO : Not bad...not bad...a Nubian.\nQUI-GON : It's in good order, except for the parts we need.\nWATTO : ...but what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last\nrace. It will take some time to fix it.\n\nANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.\n\nANAKIN : Ahhhh....it wasn't my fault really...Sebulba flashed me with his\nvent ports. I actually saved the Pod...mostly.\nWATTO : (laughing) That you did. The boy is good, no doubts there.\nQUI-GON : I have...acquired a Pod in a game of chance. \"The fastest ever\nbuilt.\"\nWATTO : I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you\nsupply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings\nfifty-fifty, I think.\nQUI-GON : Fifty-fifty!?! If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you\nfront the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus\nthe cost of the parts I need...If we lose, you keep my ship.\n\nWATTO thinks about this.

He gives without any thought of\nreward.\nSHMI : He knows nothing of greed. He has...\nQUI-GON : He has special powers.\nSHMI : Yes...\nQUI-GON : He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to\nhave such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.\nSHMI : He deserves better than a slave's life.\nQUI-GON : The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who\nwas his father?\nSHMI : There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him\nbirth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?\nQUI-GON : I'm afraid not.

Trust your instincts. (he smiles) May the\nForce be with you.\n\nQUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS flip switches,\nand powerful energy binders shoot between the engines. ANAKIN flips a\nswitch, and his engine starts. The incredible ROAR of high-powered engines\nigniting echoes throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a\ndroid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine. The crowd is tense.\n\n<b>EXT.

Little Skywalker has stalled.\n\nPADME and JAR JAR are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON puts his arm\naround a very worried SHMI to comfort her. Finally, Anakin's engines\nignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one\nquadra-Pod racer still trying to get started.

SEBULBA\ndrives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock\nformation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.\nANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.\nOne of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him\non one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side\nansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off,\nthen guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast\nthat he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.\nFour TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the\nPods racing in the canyon below them.

He is being challenged by\nanother racer, XELBREE.\nSEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side\nvent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the\nalien's engine.\nThe blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly\nveers away.\nANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a\ndune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump.\nOne of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the sand, and the\nwhole thing EXPLODES.\n\n<b>EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY\n</b>\nQUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for\nany sign of the racers. JAR JAR is still annoying FANTA for information.\nThe crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is laughing with his friends, confident in\nAnakin's defeat.\nThe quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around the corner. The\nDRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and the four engines go off in all\ndirections, EXPLODING in a spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground\nas SEBULBA enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.\nKITSTER strains to see as ARTOO beeps excitedly. The announcer continues.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S)\n</b>B ; There goes Quadinaros' power couplings.\nA : Sebulba! Ka pa me cheespa wata! (Here comes Sebulba in record time.)\n\nQUI-GON, PADME, SHMI, and JAR JAR yell for joy as ANAKIN passes. JAR JAR is\nvery nervous and pounds on the back of his alien neighbor, FANTA. JAR JAR :\nWhat gooie-on?\nFANTA : Bug off.\n\nLap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands\nand YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance.

The crowd goes wild.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B : It looks like Skywalker is moving up through the field. He's in...\nA : Steeth pa nagoola! (Sixth place, not bad.)\n\nANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is\nunbearable.\nODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4 stands in front of\nthe engine and is sucked in, causing the engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out\nthe back of the engine, very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze,\nthen EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>A : Ody Mandrell! Coona wa wunda dunko! (Ody Mandrell into the pits for\nsome attention.)\nODY : Droids!\n\nTERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a small part off\nhis Pod, sending it into Terter's engine, causing him to veer into ANAKIN,\nand unhooks one of the main straps on Anakin's engines that links the Pod\nto his engines.\nANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips about wildly.\nAs the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs for it.\nFinally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to the Pod.\nSEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust, and the racer\ncrashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER, HABBA, flie into the cloud of\ndust and crashes into OBITOKI. ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the\ncloud of smoke. He hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B :At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely\nfollowed by Skywalker...\n\nANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the\nrough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes\nthrough the arena. The lights in the tower indicate that this is the third\nand last lap. WATTO begins to worry.\nSEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines.\nANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off\ncourse.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B : Skywalker is forced onto the service ramp!\nA : Oh noah!\n\nOn a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.\n\n<b>FODE BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B : Amazing... a controlled thrust and he's back on course! What a move!\n\nSEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and\npushing him through the turns.\nSEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time\nkeeping control. One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake\nloose. ANAKIN sees it and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is\ntrying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.\nANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes,\nSEBULBA is able to block.\nFinally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries\nto go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race sid by side down the final\nstretch of the track.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B : He's catching Sebulba.\nA : Inkabunga. (Incredible!)\n\nSEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN\nover and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering\nrods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.\n\n<b>FODE/BEED : - (O.S.)\n</b>B : That little human being is out of his mind.\nA : Punda tah punda! (They're neck and neck!)\nB : They're side by side!\nA : Bongo du bongu! (Shoulder to shoulder!)\n\nAs they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering\nrods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is\ntremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts\nspinning.\nThe release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue. One engine\nEXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids through the fire-balls, blackened,\nbut unhurt. He slides to a smoking stop, gets out of his racer, and throws\nwhat's left of a shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants\nare on fire, and he struggles to put them out. ANAKIN flies through the\nEXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING. PADME and JAR JAR jump up and down\nwith excitment, PADME screaming for joy. ARTOO and KITSTER whistle\nhysterically. QUI-GON and SHMI smile. ANAKIN races over the finish line,\nthe winner.\n\n<b>INT.

Too warm for my taste. Space is\ncold.\nANAKIN : You seem sad.\nPADME : The Queen is...worried. Her people are suffering...dying.

There is no interest in the common good...no civility,\nonly politics...its disgusting. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is\nlittle chance the Senate will act on the invasion.\nAMIDALA : Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.\nPALPATINE : If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real\npower...he is mired down by baseless accusations of corruption. A\nmanufactured scandal surrounds him. The bureaucrats are in charge now.\nAMIDALA : What options do we have?\nPALPATINE : Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger\nSupreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, enforces\nthe laws, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence\nin Chancellor Valorum.\nAMIDALA : He has been our strongest supporter. Is there any other way?\nPALPATINE : Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the\ncourts...\nAMIDALA : There's no time for that. The courts take even longer to decide\nthings than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator...more and more each\nday. We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.\nPALPATINE : To be realistic, Your Highness, I'd say we're going to have to\naccept Federation control for the time being.\nAMIDALA : There is something I cannot do.\n\n<b>EXT.

SENATOR PALPATINE,\nQUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo\ncongressional box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans\nover to the QUEEN.\n\nPALPATINE : If the Federation moves to defer the motion...Your Majesty,\nIbeg of you to ask for a resolution to end this congressional session.\nAMIDALA : I wish I had your confidence in this, Senator.\nPALPATINE : You must force a new election for Supreme Chancellor...I\npromise you there are many who will support us...it is our best chance...\nYour Majesty, our only, chance.\nAMIDALA : You truely believe Chancellor Valorum will not bring our motion\nto a vote?\nPALAPATINE : He is distracted...he is afraid. He will be of no help.\nVALORUM : The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of\nNaboo.\n\nThe Naboo congressional box floats into the center.\n\nPALPATINE : Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has\noccured on our peaceful system of Naboo. We have become caugt in a dispute\nyou're all well aware of, which began right here with the taxation of trade\nroutes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppresion of the\nTrade Federation.\n\nA second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with\nFederation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.\n\nLOTT DOD : This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!\nVALORUM : The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade\nFederation at this time. Please return to your station.\n\nLOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.\n\nPALPATINE : To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, the recently\nelected ruler of Naboo, to speak on our behalf.\n\nQUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.\n\nAMIDALA : Honorable representatives of the Republic, distinguished\ndelegates, and Your Honor Supreme Chancellor Valorum, I come to you under\nthe gravest of circumstances. The Naboo system has been invaded by force.\nInvaded...against all the laws of the Republic by the Droid Armies of the\nTrade...\nLOTT DOD : I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a\ncommision be sent to Naboo to assertain the truth.\nVALORUM : Overruled.\nLOTT DOD : Your Honor, you cannot allow us to be condemned without\nreasonable observation. It's against all the rules of procedure.\n\nA third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS\nMOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.\n\nAKS MOE : The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate\nfrom the Trade Federation. A commision must be appointed...that is the law.\nVALORUM : The point...\n\nVALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA.\nPALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.\n\nPALPATINE : Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on\nthe payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor\nValorum's strength will dissapear.\nVALORUM : The point is conceded...Section 523A take precedence here. Queen\nAmidala of the Naboo, will you defer your motion to allow a commission to\nexplore the validity of your accusations?\n\nQUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.\n\nAMIDALA : (angrily) I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve\nthis attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people\nsuffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body\nis not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a\n\"vote of no confidence\"...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.\nVALORUM : What?...No!\n\nThis causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur cresendos into a\nroar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands\nspeechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.\n\nMAS AMEDDA : Order! We shall have order...\n\nThings settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.\nPRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.\n\nBAIL ORGANA : Alderaan seconds the motion for a vote of no confidence in\nChancellor Valorum.\nMAD AMEDDA : The motion has been seconded by Bail Organa of Alderaan.\n\nMAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers something to him.\n\nBAIL ORGANA : There must be no delays. The motion is on the floor and must\nbe voted upon in this session.\nLOTT DOD : The Trade Federation moves the motion be sent to the procedures\ncommittee for study.\n\nThe assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.\n\nASSEMBLY : Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!\n\nPALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.\n\nPALPATINE : You see, Your Majaesty, the tide is with us...Valorum will be\nvoted out, I assure you, and they will elect in a new Chancellor, a strong\nChancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...\nMAS AMEDDA : Thew Supreme Chancellor requests a recess.

A few hundred police and guards\nhave formed an underground movement. I brought as many of the keaders as I\ncould. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much\nstronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.\nPADME : The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw theDroid Army away\nfrom the cities. We can enter the city using the secret passages on the\nwaterfall side.

We will send\nwhat pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship which is orbiting\nthe planet. If we can get past their rayshields, we can sever communication\nand their droids will be helpless.\nQUI-GON : A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons\non your fighters may not penetrate the shields on the control ship.\nOBI-WAN : And there's an even bigger danger.

He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH\nMAUL grin evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the\nendless shaft.\nThe SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment,\nOBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to hi, throwing\nDARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH\ndown.
