If you \n<br/>paid for this copy of it, you got screwed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The opening credits roll over shots of the woods.  At a cemetery, people are gathered for a funeral.  A grave has \n<br/>been dug, and a small, plain coffin, rests near it.  A man leans on the coffin, weeping a prayer.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August Nicholson:  Who'll pinch me to wake me up?  Who will laugh at me when I fall?  Whose breath will I listen for, \n<br/>so that I may sleep?  Whose hand will I hold, so that I may walk?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>A small, plain headstone, reads \"Here Lies Daniel Nicholson, Beloved son of August Nicholson, June 17, 1890, October 3, \n<br/>1897.\"  He was just seven years old.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward Walker (off-screen):  We may question ourselves, at moments such as these.  Did we make the right decision to \n<br/>settle here?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>A banquet has been laid on polished wooden tables, outdoors.  The attendees are all dressed somberly.  Many women wear \n<br/>bonnets or hats.  Some of the men are bearded, and some are not.  Some have long hair, others, short hair.  All the \n<br/>women wear their hair tied back in some way.  The dress confirms that it is the late 1800's.  The surroundings reveal \n<br/>it to be a small village in a shallow valley, surrounded by forests.  Many houses are made of stone, some of wood.  The \n<br/>banquet includes bread, corn, greens, potatoes... a bounty from the recent harvest.  Edward Walker, unofficial town \n<br/>leader, stands, making a speech before the feast.  His hair is reddish, but going gray, and he wears a beard.  \n<br/>August takes his hand.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward Walker:  We are grateful for the time we have been given.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He sits, and the villagers begin to eat.  From the woods, a moaning sound, sorrowful.  The villagers quiet, and are \n<br/>still.  Noah Percy begins to laugh and clap and stands up.  He is perhaps twenty-five, but has the mind of a small \n<br/>child.  A young man seated next to him calms him down, and gets him to sit.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Two young girls use brushes to scrub the dishes in an outdoor trough, while an older sister uses a green hand-pump to \n<br/>get water from the underground well, so the dishes can be rinsed.  The younger girls giggle and splash each other.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A woman in a gray skirt and a blue untucked blouse leads a flock of sheep into their barn.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Men and women work side-by-side in a glass greenhouse, cultivating lettuce, rhubarb, and other foods for the winter.  \n<br/>The ladies wear simple print dresses, with some petticoats underneath, and back-buttoned aprons over their dresses.  \n<br/>The men wear pants, shirts, vests, and many wear hats.  This is a simple village of working people.  Fancy clothes \n<br/>are worn only at weddings and other celebrations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Two sisters sweep the front porch of their simple home.  They wear plain boots, not fancy shoes.  They swirl their \n<br/>brooms around, light-hearted.  The older sister spots something at the edge of the porch and puts her broom down.  It \n<br/>is a red flower.  Making haste, they pluck the flower, take it some yards from their home, and bury it.  They return \n<br/>to their chores, but are subdued.  The color of the flower, red, has spooked them, for it is the bad color.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At night, a bearded young man in a yellow cloak watches the woods from a watchtower, one of two, at the edge of the \n<br/>village.  There is a bell in the tower, which can be rung as a warning.  There are yellow penants and burning torches \n<br/>all around the edge of the forest.  A low, moaning, rumbling sound comes from the trees.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At a creek in the woods, a reflection off the water shows a swaying, red-cloaked figure walking ponderously by.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>It is morning.  Edward Walker, the school-teacher, approaches a group of children outside the schoolhouse.  They are \n<br/>gathered in a circle around something.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  What manner of spectacle has attracted your attention so splendidly?  I ought to carry it in my pocket to \n<br/>help me teach.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He stands at the edge of the group and looks down.  Flies are buzzing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Who came upon this?  Philip, did you move this?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Philip:  No, Mr. Walker.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The flies buzz louder and louder.  We see what they are looking at.  It is a small animal, probably a fox.  It has \n<br/>been killed and skinned, but the meat is still on its bones.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Inside the class, a girl in a light blue dress and pigtails speaks.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Girl:  I inspected it carefully.  Its head was twisted back, and much of its fur removed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I see.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Boy:  It was murdered.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  But who is the culprit?  Who has done this heinous act?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The girl who spoke before hesitates, but she decides to voice what is in all their minds.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Girl:  Those We Don't Speak Of killed it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  There it is.  Why would such a notion come into your mind?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Boy:  They're meat-eaters.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward nods at him.  A different girl speaks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Girl:  They have large claws.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Children...  Those We Don't Speak Of, have not breached our borders in many years.  We do NOT go into THEIR \n<br/>woods, they do NOT come into OUR valley.  It is a truce.  We do not threaten them.  Why would they do this?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At a meeting of the Council of Elders, Vivian Percy is speaking.  She is there, with her husband, Robert, August \n<br/>Nicholson, Victor, Edward and Tabitha Walker, Alice Hunt, Mrs. Clack, three other men, and one other woman.  The women \n<br/>are knitting, since their hands are not needed for the meeting, and they smile and giggle.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  And we ought not to.... overlook The Flight of the Birds.  We didn't have it last year, and I, for one, \n<br/>missed it desperately.  And I know your wife missed the children, dressed in feathers and such.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Tabitha:  I am fond of it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She looks hopefully at her husband.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I do not have a say in this matter.  August Nicholson is chair of today's meeting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>A door opens at the end of the meeting hall, and all turn to see who has come in.  It is a man with his hat in his \n<br/>hands, respectful.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Man:  There is a young man who has requested a word with the elders.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  Well, do have him come forward.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The young man is Lucius Hunt, only son of the widow Alice Hunt.  She jumps a bit when she sees him, but smiles.  He \n<br/>wears denim work-pants, a gray shirt, and a brown jacket.  His hair is a bit curly, but short, and there is a scar on \n<br/>his lip.  He is clearly nervous and sways from one foot to the other.  He holds a note, which he reads aloud.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  Hello, Lucius.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  My mother is unaware of the reason for my visit today.  She did not give her consent, or consult me in any \n<br/>form.  The passing of little Daniel Nicholson, from illness, and other events, have weighed on my thoughts.  I ask \n<br/>permission to cross into the forbidden woods and travel to the nearest town.  I will gather medicines, and I will \n<br/>return.  With regards to Those We Don't Speak Of, I am certain they will let me pass.  Creatures can sense emotion \n<br/>and fear.  They will see I am pure of intention, and not afraid.  The end.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>His voice has been shaky throughout.  It is clear that such a long speech from him is an unheard-of, thing, and that \n<br/>he is normally so quiet that people ask him to speak up.  The elders stare at him.  The wind moans past the watchtower.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Alice (off-screen):  What goes on in that head of yours?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Inside their house, all is simple.  The beams of the loft are visible.  The floor is plain wood.  Alice stands in an \n<br/>ankle-length nightgown, in the doorway of her bedroom.  An oil-lamp and some candles are lit.  There is no electricity, \n<br/>running water, or flush toilets in this village, although such things are available in other parts of the world.  Lucius \n<br/>sits on the stairs, tying his boot-laces.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Say something, Lucius.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Finton Coin is in the tower, and I've promised to sit with him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Hmm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the watchtower, we see Finton Coin, a broad-faced, light-haired young man with Grecian features, wearing a yellow \n<br/>cloak.  Lucius sits on the floor near a lamp.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Do you ever think of the towns, Finton?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  The towns?  What for?  They're wicked places where wicked people live.  That's all.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He pauses for a few moments.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Thank you Lucius.  You're a good friend.  I do hope no one saw you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the orchard, several women stand, staring at a spectacle.  It is another skinned fox.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>There is a brief meeting in the meeting hall.  Alice stands at the front, ahead of the elders, and speaks to the \n<br/>villagers' concerns.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  What we SEEM to have amongst us, is a predator of some type, most likely a coyote, or a wolf.  Its manner of... \n<br/>of killing and removing the fur, but leaving the flesh torn, may be a sign that this animal suffers from madness.  And \n<br/>for the next fortnight we should be vigilant for sightings of this coyote.  Keep careful watch over our little ones, \n<br/>as they play on the hills.  As for the other notion...  We do not believe our boundary has been breached.  Those We \n<br/>Don't Speak Of are much...  LARGER creatures than coyotes.  And we would know, if they had been here.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The villagers murmur.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Outside, villagers stride away, back to their work.  Edward walks with his eldest daughter, Kitty.  She is beautiful, \n<br/>with red hair and fair skin, very slender and willowy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Ahhh, it's frightful, this business of the coyote, is it not, Papa?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Do not feel worried, Kitty.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  You are not troubled?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I am certain it will all end soon.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty (slyly):  Can we speak on other matters, then?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It would be a relief.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty (giggly):  I'm in love!  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They stand behind a house, possibly their own.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  I want your permission to marry, Papa!  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward is incredulous that his daughter would come to him and ask to marry, without her supposed-fiance present.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  There's a proper manner in which these things are supposed to happen, such as the boy would normally be \n<br/>standing next to you, in a moment such as this!  Where is the BOY in all this, Kitty?!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  I haven't spoken to him as of yet.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  The young man is unaware of your intentions?!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  He has a... quiet way.  I was going to talk with him, Papa, but not without your blessings.  I WON'T talk with \n<br/>him without your blessings, Papa.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Kitty!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  It's Lucius Hunt.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward pauses for a moment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Lucius.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  You think badly of him?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  No.  No, I have been thinking about him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  He's not LIKE the other boys, Papa.  He- he- he doesn't joke, or, or bounce about.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  No, he certainly does not.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  I have your blessings, then?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward sighs and can't help a smile.  Kitty jumps into his arms, joyful.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Look, do me one favor first.  Do NOT tell anyone else of your burstings until you have spoken with the young \n<br/>man.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Lucius is in the workshop, sharpening a tool.  Kitty approaches him, wearing a pretty yellow dress.  Her voice is \n<br/>slightly coy at the begining, but as she goes on, she becomes more wild.  It is clear, however, that she has rehearsed \n<br/>her speech.  She can't seem to help smiling and giggling, and she's probably very nervous.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Good afternoon, Lucius.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius stands up and turns to face her, wary, leaning back slightly.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  I wanted to, to... to tell you something.  I love you, Lucius.  I love you like the day is long!  I love you \n<br/>more than the sun and the moon together!  And if you feel the same way, then we should not hide it any longer.  It's \n<br/>a gift, love is.  We should be thankful!  We should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs!  Thank you!  \n<br/>Thank you!  Thank you!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She stops waving her arms about and smooths her skirt, smiling at him.  He looks at her strangely, almost expressionless.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Kitty lays on her bed, sobbing and screaming.  Her younger sister, Ivy, sits at her side, stroking her shoulder and \n<br/>singing a lullaby.  She has reddish hair, too, but wears it comparatively short, about shoulder-length, barely any \n<br/>longer than some of the boys in the village.  She wears a pretty blue denim dress.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Shhh.  Shhh.  Baby, sleep, gently sleep, life is long is long and love is deep.  Time will be sweet for thee.  \n<br/>All the world to see.  Time to look about and know, how the shadows come and go.  How the breeze stirs the trees, how \n<br/>the blossoms grow.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>We see their parents, and the four youngest of the six walker daughters, standing about at the entrance to the room.  \n<br/>It is clear that that is Kitty and Ivy's space, that they are close together in age (perhaps twenty-one and nineteen \n<br/>respectively), while their younger sisters are all between about three and ten or so.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Lucius brings firewood to August.  The oil lamp is burning dimly. \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  I often wondered if yu and my son bonded because neither of you were fond of speaking.  You're very kind.  \n<br/>You must pardon my manners, I haven't slept in many nights.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Some of the boys are at a place called \"The Stump,\" where they are playing a game.  Sort of like a test of manhood, \n<br/>they stand on the stump with their back to the woods at night, and see how long they can stay without getting scared.  \n<br/>Tonight it it Jamison's turn.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop Crane:  You are doing capital, Jamison!  Just a few more moments, huh?  Gather your bravery.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The other boys press in close.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  Do not jostle about so!  You'll ruin my shirt.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Jamison whimpers, and there is a moaning from the woods.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Jamison (whispering):  They made a sound when I made a sound!  And they mimic before they attack!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  Have courage, man.  That's a wives' tale.  It isn't true.  Do not falter!  Steel yourself.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At August's house, he is still speaking to Lucius, who is loading his wood-box.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  You know, like a dog can smell you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Pardon me, Mr. Nicholson?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  You may run from sorrow, as we have.  Sorrow will find you.  It can smell you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He looks at the space under the stairs.  There is a strange box there, made of wood, but stained dark black, and \n<br/>with a lock for its lid.  Lucius looks at it strangely.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Jamison breathes heavily, as the woods rustle.  There is the sound of footsteps, and a strange growl that you or I \n<br/>might associate with a weed-whacker.  Jamison hops off the stump and rushes toward the boys, and they run back to the \n<br/>village, panting and chuckling.  They arrive in the safe area of the village and slow down.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  I didn't know you could run so fast!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Jamison:  We're still for running and staying- hey!  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop pulls Jamison's hat from his head and pushes him further towards home.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>It is daytime, a view of the village from the woods.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty (off-screen):  Noah ought to be punished.  He whacked little Joseph with a stick again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah and some boys are fighting.  Noah laughs and hits them as they say \"ow.\"  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Children:  No more hitting!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Girl:  Why don't they grab it?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy sits in a pretty blue dress on a bench outside a building.  Her head is turned to the side and she is listening.  \n<br/>She hears distant shouting.  It is clear once she stands up that she is blind.  She takes a lovely wooden cane and \n<br/>swings it back and forth, using this method to guide herself toward the sounds of the fight.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy (off-screen; forceful):  Noah Percy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The fighting slows a bit.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Stop your fussing, right this moment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The kids murmur and laugh.  He disentangles himself, and jumps up, following her away.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>--\n<br/></b>\n<br/>They stand at the door of the \"Quiet Room,\" a place children are sent when they misbehave.  There is a lamp, several \n<br/>chairs, a coat-rack, and not much else.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  You're in trouble, you know.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  No hitting.  No hitting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I'm to place you in the quiet room.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Um, I'll cry quarts.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What if we strike a deal?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Yeah, capital idea.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  It would be prudent to keep our deal a secret, can you do that?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah (whispers):  Can I keep a secret?  (Normal voice) Like a church mouse.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  You needent go to the quiet room if you take an oath to never strike any person again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  No hitting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  No, no hitting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  No hitting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  No hitting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They shake hands.  Ivy leans slightly and taps her cheek, and Noah kisses it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The deal is struck.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She closes the door of the quiet room and goes down the steps to the ground.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  We ought not to return right away, hmm?  What shall we do with our stolen time?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Hmm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Hmmm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Hmmm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Hmmm.  Shall we have a foot race?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Yes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (excited):  Up the hill to the resting rock!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah (grinning):  No cheating.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (offended):  What a deeply scandalous thing to say.  I insist you take that back.  Is that the school bell?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah turns to look at the school and Ivy takes off running the other direction.  She knows her way around very well.  \n<br/>Noah turns back, looks at her, looks down and smiles, then runs after her.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Arrhhhh!  Ivy, you cheated!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I know!  I'm sorry!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They laugh and run all the way to the resting rock.  Ivy is very fast, but no match for Noah's long legs, and he barely \n<br/>beats her there.  Lucius hunt is sitting there, eating a muffin, which he shares with Noah.  Ivy sits down, catching \n<br/>her breath.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  My sister cried a lot.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius seems somewhat surprised that she knows he is there, given that she is blind.  She moves her head and eyes like \n<br/>a sighted person, but only because she did not lose her sight until several years into her life.  Noah runs off \n<br/>somewhere.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  You wonder how I recognized you?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She nodds and leans on her cane.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Some people - just a handful, mind you - give off the tiniest color.  It's faint, like a haze.  It's the only \n<br/>thing I ever see in the darkness.  Papa has it, too.  Do you wonder what your color is?  Well, that I won't tell you.  \n<br/>It's not ladylike to speak of such things.  You shouldn't even have asked.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She is making a joke for herself, and smiles at it.  It is clear that she is very strange, running like a boy, wearing \n<br/>her hair short, making jokes to herself, and her strangeness seems directly tied-in with the fact that she is blind.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  You run like a boy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Thank you.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She pauses a moment, shyly, but then continues.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I know why you deny my sister.  When I was younger...  You used to hold my arm when I walked.  Then suddenly \n<br/>you stopped.  One day, I even tripped in your presense, and almost fell.  I was faking, of course.  But still, you did \n<br/>not hold me.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She whispers, almost sensually.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Sometimes we don't do things we want to do, so that others won't know we want to do them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah returns with something in his hands.  He shows it to Lucius, motioning him to be quiet.  He sits next to Ivy and \n<br/>lifts her hand, placing a frog in it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The frog ribbets.  She yelps and laughs, tossing the frog back at him.  He takes a twig of berries from his pocket, \n<br/>loosening feathers in the process.  The berries, he places in Ivy's hands.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What's this?  Oh, berries.  What a splendid present.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Be cautious.  You are holding the bad color.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy goes still, and cups a hand over the berries.  The fun, sunshiny atmosphere is spoiled by rich, thick fear.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  This color attracts Those We Don't Speak Of, we must bury it.  You ought not to pick that color berry anymore.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius (whispering):  He picked it from his pocket.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What's wrong?  Your breathing has changed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  I've never set eyes on these before.  You did not pick that now.  Where did you find this?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah takes his hand and leads him around the side of the rock.  He is mentally retarded, but he knows that something \n<br/>has changed this afternoon.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At the meeting house, Lucius reads another note to the elders.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Today at Resting Rock, Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker berries of the bad color.  When asked where he found these \n<br/>berries, for they were not like others I have seen, he pointed to the drawing upon resting rock.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>We see Lucius, Ivy, and Noah staring at the side of the rock (although Ivy does not see it).  There is a drawing of a \n<br/>strange, reddish-colored creature, with skeletons all around it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius (off-screen):  It is my belief that Noah Percy has entered the woods, and has done so on many occasions.  It is \n<br/>also my belief that, because of his innocence, those creatures who reside in the woods did not harm him.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Back in the meeting house, he continues to read.  The circle is in a slightly different order today, more mixed up, and \n<br/>facing a different direction.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  This strengthens my feeling that they will let me pass if they sense I am not a threat.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Alice (off-screen, later in the day):  We shall speak of the town, just this once, and we shall never speak of it again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She sits, knitting yarn that is wound around Lucius's hands.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Your father left for the market on a Tuesday, at a quarter past nine in the morning.  He was found, robbed and \n<br/>naked, in the filthy river, two days later.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius begins to shake, and tears stream down his face.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Why'd you tell me this blackness?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  So you will know the nature of what you desire.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  I do not desire it.  (Angry) My intentions are true to my word. I think of NOTHING but the people of this \n<br/>village.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Forgive me.  I am but scared for my only son's life.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  I am not the one with secrets.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  What is your meaning?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  There are secrets of every corner of this village.  Do you not feel it?  Do you not see it?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He points at the black box in the corner of the living room.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  That is for my own well-being, so the evil things from my past are kept close and not forgotten.  Forgetting \n<br/>would be to let them be born again in another form.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius (standing):  Then let us open it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice (final):  No.  Perhaps we should speak with Edward Walker together.  He may be able-\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  He hides, too.  He hides his feelings for you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Oh!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Exasperated and startled, she turns and walks to her bedroom.  He follows her.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Sometimes, we don't do things, yet others know we want to do things, so we don't do them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Realizing he bungled that statement badly, he hangs his head a bit and makes a sort of \"oh, darn!\" motion with his \n<br/>hand.  Alice returns to her bedroom door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  What nonsense are you saying?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  You needent worry.  Nothing will happen to me.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  You remind me of a colt sometimes.  \n<br/>\n<br/>She pauses a moment.\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  What makes you think he has feelings for me?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius (whispering):  He never touches you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Lucius and some other boys walk around the perimeter of the village, painting yellow marks on tall poles.  They wear \n<br/>cloaks of yellow wool, the safe color.  Lucius sets down his paint bucket and pushes his hood back, then slowly, \n<br/>purposefully, he walks into the woods.  He does not go far, just to a bush where there are red berries.  He plucks a \n<br/>branch of them.  He is very solemn.  There is a creaking noise, a crack, and a growl, then some rustling.  Lucius \n<br/>sees movement out of the corner of his eyes.  He turns and leaves the woods slowly.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>It is night.  Ivy is crouched, and she stands.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  There's no escape!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She turns and perceives Lucius by his \"color,\" as she calls the haze she sees around him when he is near her.  She is \n<br/>surprised.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Oh, hellO!  I was just playing a game with Noah.  The rascal must have gone to hide in my house again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She crouches to retrieve her cane, then stands.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (loudly):  Houses are agaist the rules!  (whispering) He knows that.  (normal) Are you all right?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She looks at Lucius with some concern, for he is more solemn than usual.  He walks her to her front porch.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  We're tending to the children tonight, Kitty and I.  I should be with her.  Be well.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She steps on to the porch, then turns, steps back down, and looks at him, hands perched on her cane.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I heard my parents speaking of you.  I know of your request to go to the towns.  I think it is noble, but I do \n<br/>not think it is right.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Are you not angry you have no sight?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She smiles and leans a bit towards him, whispering.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I see the world, Lucius Hunt.  Just not as you see it.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  What of Noah, then?  What if there are medicines for Noah that could help him be still and to learn?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  May we stop speaking of this?  It is putting knots in my stomach.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She steps back on to the porch, and turns to talk to him from there.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (whispering):  Kitty is to be married.  She's found love... again.  With Christop Crane.  You think it an odd \n<br/>choice, right?  You know, he won't sit back in his chair for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts.  But he does have \n<br/>a gentlemanly way about him.  And he does care for my sister, deeply.  I think Kitty is blessed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She pauses, nervous, but continues.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I am blessed as well.  My older sister is now spoken for.  I am now free to receive intrest from anyone... who \n<br/>might have interest.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She raises her tone at the end, almost like a question, and very hopeful-sounding.  Lucius' face is still solemn, but \n<br/>there is something almost like a smile about his mouth.  Children are laughing in the house.  She turns and walks to \n<br/>the door, waving her cane in front of her, and goes inside.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  I'm going to get you!  Oh!  I got you!  I got you.  Can you fetch a blanket for me?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Have you seen Noah?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy walks to a closet, and opens it.  Inside, Noah is hiding.  She does not know that he is there, and he laughs \n<br/>silently as she takes a blanket and closes the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Finton Coin is in the watchtower again, wearing his yellow cloak.  There is a lamp lit, sitting on the edge of the \n<br/>hatch.  There is a bump, and the lamp wiggles.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Lucius?  Lucius?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He crawls to the hatch and opens it, peering down.  There is a flash of red as a creature walks by, spikey needles \n<br/>sticking out the back.  Finton drops the hatch on his head, lets it fall into place, and latches it.  He sits \n<br/>whimpering in pain for a moment, then gets up and rings a warning bell over and over again, a steady clanging.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>All around the village, people hurry into their homes, exclaiming in fright.  Lucius marches steadily through them, \n<br/>helping people inside, but he his making his way towards one place, the Walker home.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Kitty, Ivy, and their four younger sisters are sitting on a sofa in their living room, when they hear the bells.  Noah \n<br/>runs through the door, happy and excited, clapping and waving his arms.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  They're coming.  They're coming!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Close the door.  Noah, close the door, okay?  Close the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty bustles around, putting the edge of the door in Noah's hands, and getting her littlest sisters down into the \n<br/>celler, where they can lock the hatch and keep safe from the creatures.  She does a good job of maintaining a calm \n<br/>demeanor.  Noah keeps clapping and shouting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Noah, come on inside!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Come on inside!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Outside, the last villagers are getting into their homes, shouting.  Lucius helps a woman bolt her shutters, then \n<br/>quickly dashes around the corner as a creature comes up to the door.  The creature wears a red, hooded robe with wide \n<br/>sleeves, almost monk-like.  There are brown spines growing in a bunch out of a hump on its back.  It has long claws.  \n<br/>The face is a snout sticking out of the hood.  It makes a strange growling noise, almost a vooooomph.  It scratches \n<br/>the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy stands at the front door of her house, waiting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  They're coming.  Come on in!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Let's close the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty manages to get everyone except Ivy inside the celler.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Lucius is outside, walking.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  They're coming!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty is getting desperate.  The longer the door is open, the more danger they are in.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  He's inside safe somewhere!  Please, close the door!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy is shaking, badly frightened, but determined and sure that Lucius will come to her.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  He'll come back to make sure we're safe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Ivy!  Ivy, please.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy turns back to the door and slowly raises her arm, her hand outstretched, waiting.  There is a scratching and \n<br/>growling at the side of the house.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty (whispering):  Please.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (trembling):  No.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty (whispering):  Don't let them in.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy stands, shaking, tears in her eyes, waiting for Lucius.  A creature comes up from the side, growling.  Just as the \n<br/>creature reaches for Ivy's hand, it is firmly clasped in Lucius's, as they dash into the house.  Everything slows down \n<br/>as they bolt the door, hands clasped, and run into the celler.  Noah continues to invite the creatures in.  This is a \n<br/>game to him.  The girls are all in various states of crying and silent prayer.  There is a thumping, and the creatures \n<br/>enter the house, growling.  Ivy looks down to see her hand clasped in Lucius's.  He hasn't let go.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In every home in the village, families tremble in their cellers, fearing the inevitible bump-thump, and growl, as the \n<br/>creatures enter their homes.  They cover their ears and lower their heads, praying, waiting.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The next morning, the breeze is high, blowing autumn leaves off the trees.  There are red slashes on the doors of every \n<br/>building in the village.  In the meeting house, Edward is talking, as we look at the red slashes everywhere.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (off-screen):  By the markings we find this morning on our homes...  I feel they were warning us.  They acted as \n<br/>if threatened.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August (off-screen):  Creatures have never attacked us without reason.  Does anyone here know of a reason why these \n<br/>events may have occured?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>A woman approaches the elders, who sit in a line at the front of the meeting house.  She hands a note to Vivian Percy, \n<br/>Noah's mother.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Who has written this note?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>No one answers.  She stands, clears her throat, and reads it aloud.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Please read so that all may hear.  I have brought this burden upon us.  On the day before last, I crossed \n<br/>the forbidden line into Covington Woods...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The villagers gasp aloud, and murmur.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  ... and was witnessed there by Those We Don't Speak Of.  I am deeply sorry.  I have shamed myself and my \n<br/>family.  I pray that my actions will cause no further pains.  With deepest sorrow...... Lucius Hunt.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She sits.  The crowd murmurs.  The elders take each others hands.  Everyone turns to look at Lucius in the back, as \n<br/>Edward walks back to talk to him.  Many stand up.  Noah follows Edward, giggling, and has to be led back by one of \n<br/>the men.  Edward walks right up to Lucius, who has tears in his eyes, and does not raise them from the floor.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (kindly):  Do not fret.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward crouches, and Lucius slowly looks into his eyes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  You are fearless in a way that I shall never know.  Lucius shakes badly, but manages the tiny beginnings of \n<br/>a smile.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Outside, tables are set up for a banquet.  It is Kitty's wedding day.  She sits next to her father, wearing a filmy \n<br/>white gown and veil, holding his hand.  Her husband-to-be is next to her, followed by Ivy, and Noah.  At least \n<br/>ninety-five people live in this village, probably more, and all have turned out for the wedding.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We are grateful... for the time we have been given.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>There are quiet cheers, and the crowd begins to talk and pass food around.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Two young men in yellow cloaks, their hoods drawn about their faces, bear a litter between them.  On this litter, \n<br/>covered by a yellow flowered cloth and white and yellow daisies, is a large hunk of lamb, almost half of one of the \n<br/>animals.  They set their burden down, uncover it, lift it, and toss it onto a rock at the edge of the forest, \n<br/>something like a sacrificial offering.  They leave the litter, turn and go.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy sits on the ground in a pink dress so pale it looks almost white.  Next to her is Mrs. clack, wearing a creamy dress, \n<br/>almost yellow, and a knitted shawl around her shoulders.  Both have flowers in their hair.  Mrs. Clack smokes a pipe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  I had an elder sister.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (surprised):  Mrs. Clack, you've been keeping secrets!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Both chuckle a bit.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  Oh, Kitty reminds me of her, so!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What manner of person was she?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  Saucy.  And we fought endlessly.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy nods.  They both laugh.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  May I ask her name?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>There is a pause.  Mrs. Clack does not answer.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (serious):  Why did she not come to Covington Woods?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  My sister did not live past her twenty-third birthday.  A group of men took her life in an alley by our \n<br/>home.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They are both sad, but August Nicholson comes out of the greenhouse and asks everyone to follow him inside.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>It has been prepared as a place to have a party, to sing and dance and eat.  There is music playing.  Ivy approaches her \n<br/>sister shakily.  She seems to want to be on better footing with her, lest she die as young as Mrs. Clack's sister.  \n<br/>She hugs her tightly.  Both have tears in their eyes.  Christop backs away a bit.  Kitty has deep bags under her eyes.  \n<br/>It appears she has not slept much recently.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  She's not going to squeeze my shirt like that, is she?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty looks at him with reproach, and then both smile, to put on a good face for their neighbors.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A line of people have formed to congratulate Edward and Tabitha.  Victor leaves the line, and Alice Hunt enters it, \n<br/>facing Edward.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Many blessings on this most joyous of days.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It was a rare and lovely ceremony, was it not?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Glorious.  I saw your hand move to your eyes on more than one occasion.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (sheepish):  It must have been dust of some matter.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She holds out her hand, but he does not take it.  She balls it into a fist, smiles, and moves on.  When she turns back, \n<br/>Edward is clasping Mrs. Percy's hand and arm and talking with her.  She gives a startled smile, but seems pleased.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The young people, and some of the older ones, are dancing in rings around each other.  Kitty grabs Ivy and pulls her \n<br/>in to dance, weaving her in and out.  Everyone is laughing and enjoying themselves.  A more complicated dance begins, \n<br/>with several circles of people, and people ducking in and out.  A woman plays a complicated tune on the piano.  Ivy, \n<br/>with her sensitive hearing, hears what others cannot:  Two children screaming for Mr. Walker outside.  Eventually the \n<br/>rest of the villagers hear it, too.  Ivy holds out her arm and makes her way for the end of the greenhouse.  Everything \n<br/>is in confusion, but Lucius's arm reaches up and he grabs Ivy's hand, leading her the rest of the way.  Everyone \n<br/>gathers around Mr. Walker, and two young boys, about seven and nine years old.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (gravely; gently):  Speak up.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Older boy:  They're in the village.  They left more warnings.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>There is shock all around.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Younger boy:  They wish us to leave.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (despairing):  That cannot be.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Older boy:  One saw us.  It ran off into the darkness.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  You are certain?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They nod.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Can you boys stay close to Ivy, here?  She'll tell you some funny stories and have you laughing soon.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy reaches out her hands to the boys, smiling reassuringly, but as soon as they have turned to face Mr. Walker, her \n<br/>face becomes serious, and she clutches them in her arms.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We will go together.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>They set out in a double line, some carrying lanterns.  As they reach the houses, people branch off to enter their \n<br/>homes.  They slow down.  On the ground are many, many animal corpses, skinned and broken like the first.  Some are \n<br/>strung up in doorways.  It is horrific.  Christop ushers his new wife away from them, breaking their terrible, \n<br/>hypnotic spell.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward and Alice stand outside the barn.  Alice is what we would call \"freaked out.\"  Edward is calmer, but still \n<br/>concerned.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice (whispering):  Livestock has been taken, and skinned.  The hides and feathers are missing.  There are marks on \n<br/>the door where it was opened.  The marks are high.  Coyotes cannot reach that height.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward holds up his hand where the marks are on the barn door.  They are man-height.  Only a creature could have \n<br/>done this.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Two men stand guard at each watchtower.  The party decorations are dangling askew.  The candle-lanterns are still lit.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the middle of the night, Ivy lays in bed with her eyes open.  She is unused to sleeping in Kitty's bed.  Suddenly \n<br/>she sits up in bed, gasping.  She walks out on the porch, using memory and touch to guide her to where Lucius is \n<br/>sitting.  She sits down next to him.  They are perhaps four inches apart.  They speak in low voices, so as not to \n<br/>wake Ivy's family.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The elders are going to have an inquiry tomorrow.  Each member of the village is to be questioned in the meeting \n<br/>hall.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  To see how the border was breached?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Yes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>There is a pause.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius.  It is cold outside.  You ought to go in.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Why are you on this porch?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  It is not safe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  There are other porches.  Do you find me too much of a tomboy?  I do long to do boy things.  Like that game the \n<br/>boys play at the stump.  They put their backs to the woods, and see how long they can wait before getting scared.  \n<br/>That's so exciting.  I understand you hold the record.  It will never be broken, they say.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  It's just children's games.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  How is it you are brave when all the rest of us shake in our boots?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  I do not worry about what will happen, only what needs to be done.  How did you know I was here?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I saw you out the window.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius is stunned.  He looks at her strangely.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  No... I won't tell you your color.  Stop asking.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She pauses, and then ventures something VERY daring, never betraying how much she is risking by what she says.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  When we are married, will you dance with me?  I find dancing very agreeable.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius is stunned again.  Ivy has just proposed marriage to him, or rather, she has stated that it is inevitable.  He is \n<br/>shocked into honesty.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Why can you not say what is in your head?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Why can you not stop saying what is in yours?  Why must you lead, when I want to lead?  If I want to dance, I \n<br/>will ask you to dance.  If I want to speak, I will open my mouth and speak.  Everyone is forever plaguing me to speak \n<br/>further.  Why?  What... good is it to tell you you are in my every thought from the time I wake?  What good can come \n<br/>from my saying I-- I sometimes cannot think clearly, or- or do my work properly?  What gain can rise from my telling \n<br/>you... the only time I feel fear as others do, is when I think of you in harm?  That is why I am on this porch, Ivy \n<br/>Walker.  I fear for your safety above all others.  And yes...  I will dance with you on our wedding night.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He has been shaking and she has been calm, but now she starts to shake and tears fall from her cheeks.  He takes her \n<br/>face in his hand, and they gently kiss.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Beatrice (off-screen):  I had been to the storage shed twice to fetch food prior to the wedding ceremony.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice (off-screen):  And the livestock was untouched at that time?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Beatrice (off-screen):  Yes, Mrs. Hunt.  All was as it should be.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Beatrice stands inside the meeting house, facing the elders.  She is young and pretty.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  Thank you, Beatrice.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Beatrice looks like she wants to say more, but she turns and starts to walk away.  Then she turns back.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Beatrice:  I beg your pardon.  Is it true... about Lucius and Ivy?  There are whispers all over the village.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice leans out to look at her and smiles.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  We were informed early this morning of their intentions.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Beatrice:  It is amazing to witness which two people love chooses to unite.  It follows no rules.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>This touches Alice deeply.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At the Walker home, Ivy, and the newly-married Kitty, sit on the bed that used to be Kitty's.  Ivy seems somewhat \n<br/>nervous.  She knows that Kitty is not over her love of Lucius.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Kitty... I wanted to speak with you first.  I would not want you to feel pain, in any fashion.  You are my \n<br/>cherished one.  If you were to feel badly about Lucius, I would not have it.  One love to sacrifice another love is \n<br/>not right.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  There is nothing you could do that would sacrifice my love for you.  You are my cherished one as well.  God \n<br/>bless you and your life together.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>It is obviously hard for her to say this, and she seems like she doesn't entirely believe her own words.  She takes \n<br/>Ivy's hand and wipes the tears from her face.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>There is a knock on the door of Lucius's workshop.  Lucius is reading a letter as he unlatches the door.  Noah stands \n<br/>outside on a lower step.  His eyes are bright red from crying, and he is crying still.  His hair is tangled and he is \n<br/>unkempt.  Something has upset him greatly.  This startles Lucius, who immediately thinks of his Ivy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  What's happened?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah steps inside.  He tries to say something, but his mouth won't make the words.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  Is this about Ivy and myself?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He turns and walks to his desk, and starts to speak.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius:  I know you are very fond of her.  And I know she is fond of you.  There are different types of love.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>As he turns toward Noah, he stops, startled, and looks down.  Noah's hand is clutched against Lucius's belly.  He \n<br/>pulls a bloody knife out of Lucius's belly.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Ohhhh....\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Lucius falls to the floor, groaning for God and for Ivy.  Noah can't seem to make up his mind about what to do.  He \n<br/>puts down the knife, then takes it up again and stabs Lucius several more times.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mr. and Mrs. Percy are getting ready for a meeting.  There is a thump as Noah sits down on the porch.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Noah?  You'll be late for the meeting hall.  Would you like your father to walk you there?  Noah?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They exit and look at him.  He looks normal, until they come closer and he turns from his seat in the rocking chair, \n<br/>and they see blood all over his hands and clothes.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Oh, the bad... the bad color.  Oh.  Bad color.  Bad color!  Bad color!  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He drools and taps at himself, distraught.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Noah:  Mama!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A man bursts into te inquiries at the meeting hall and strides toward the elders.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Man:  I beg your pardon.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  What is it?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Man:  There's been an accident.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy and Kitty are smiling and chuckling as they leave the Walker home.  They pause when they see two young women \n<br/>dashing up to them.  One gasps for breath as she speaks to them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Girl:  Noah Percy was found with quarts of blood upon his clothes and hands.  The blood was not his own and he will \n<br/>not speak as to whose it is.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  God in heaven!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy runs off.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kitty:  Ivy!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The villagers run about, checking into each others homes, asking if anyone is injured.  Ivy has her cane.  Her shawl \n<br/>slips from her shoulders, her heart beats in her ears, as she whispers the numbers of the steps to Lucius's workshop.  \n<br/>She reaches the steps, drops her cane, and scrambles up the steps and in the door.  She knocks.  No answer.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Lucius?  Lucius Hunt?!  (stern) You answer me right this moment!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She runs into something soft, and crouches down.  She begins to shake as she feels him there.  A man runs up the steps \n<br/>and sees her.  He shouts for Mr. Walker, who runs inside the workshop.  Ivy clutches at Lucius, running her hands \n<br/>through his hair frantically, eyes wide.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Papa... I cannot see his color.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Ivy.  Come away.  COme away.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She shrieks as he drags her gently off of Lucius and hands her to another man.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Take her!!!  Take her!!!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack stands in front of the medical building, her shawl clutched around her shoulders.  Many of the villagers \n<br/>stand there, waiting for news of Lucius.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  He has suffered a great deal.  He may pass at any time.  Please give him all your prayers and good \n<br/>thoughts.  He will hear them.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy stands off to one side, blood smeared across the front of her blouse, her face expressionless.  Many of the vilagers \n<br/>look at her, and give her her distance.  She sways back and forth on her cane.  She begins to shake.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Inside the quiet room, Noah sits in his long underwear and trousers.  The bloody clothes have been taken from him for \n<br/>cleaning.  The door unlocks.  Mr. Percy lets a stern-faced Ivy inside.  She hands her cane to him, and walks straight \n<br/>forward to Noah, grasping him so she knows where he is.  Then she slaps him, again and again and again.  Mr. Percy \n<br/>grabs her and leads her out of the quiet room.  Noah begins to shriek in rage and confusion.  Ivy has told him not \n<br/>to hit, and yet here she is, hitting him.  Mr. Percy shuts and locks the door from the outside, and Noah shouts and \n<br/>bangs about.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy sits in her living room facing her father, shaky but firm, as usual.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I am in love.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I know.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  He is in love with me.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I know.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  If he dies... all that is life to me will die with him.  I ask permission... to travel through Covington Woods... \n<br/>and go to the towns... to retrieve medicines... that may save... Lucius Hunt.  You are my father.  I will listen to \n<br/>you in all things.  I will trust your decision.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Outside the medical building, Victor is speaking with Edward and Tabitha.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Victor (off-screen):  I've done what I can to close the wounds.  There's an infection.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  What can be done to mend him?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Victor:  We can only pray.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  If there were no limitations, what could be done?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Victor:  Hmmm?  What are you asking me?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Is there anything at all that can be done to mend the boy?  Please, Victor, would you be so kind as to answer \n<br/>my question.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Victor is stunned.  He says nothing for a moment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Victor:  If the infection is contained, he may still survive.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Tabitha takes Edward out behind the gardens of winter vegetables.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Tabitha:  I must speak up.  You have a restless spirit.  I know the thing that is in your head.  You're thinking of \n<br/>going to the towns.  Tell me I'm wrong.  You have made an oath, Edward, as all have, never to go back.  It is a \n<br/>painful bargain, but no good can come without sacrifice.  These are your words I'm saying.  You cannot break the oath.  \n<br/>It is sacred.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It is a crime, what has happened to Lucius.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Tabitha:  YOU have taken the oath, you and the rest of the elders, are you listening to me?  YOU.... have taken the oath.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>All at once, her peculiar emphasis of the word \"you\" hits him, and he almost smiles.  She looks relieved that he has \n<br/>gotten the message.  They both cry, and hug.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward approaches Ivy, who sits in a rocking chair on their front porch.  She has a shawl around her shoulders, for \n<br/>the day is chill.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  The moment I heard my daughter's vision had finally failed her, and that she would forever be blind, I was \n<br/>sitting in that very chair.  I was so ashamed.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward and Ivy walk along the edge of a pasture, toward the very edge of the village.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  What do you know about your grandfather?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy is unsure, but she answers as best she can.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  He was the wealthiest man in the towns?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  That he was, he had a gift for that.  If he was given one dollar, in less than a fortnight, he would have \n<br/>turned it into five.  You do not know of money.  It is not part of our life here.  Money can be a wicked thing.  It \n<br/>can turn men's hearts black.  Good men's hearts.  My father could not see this, for all his gifts.  He was a poor \n<br/>judge of a man's character.  Your grandfather WAS a good man, Ivy.  He had a laugh that could be heard three houses \n<br/>away.  He used to hold my hand as I hold yours.  He taught me strength, and showed me love, and told me to lead when \n<br/>others would only follow.  Your grandfather, James Walker, died in his sleep.  A man put a gun to his head and shot \n<br/>him while he dreamed.  I tell you this so you will understand some of the reasons for my actions, and the actions of \n<br/>others.  You are a strong one, Ivy.  You lead when others would only follow.  You see light, when there is only \n<br/>darkness.  I trust you.  I trust you among all others.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Thank you, father.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>They stop walking.  Ivy has tears on her face.  Edward holds her by her shoulders.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Ivy, do you know where you are?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (uncomfortable):  At the old shed that is not to be used.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward smiles at his daughter's sense of direction and goes to open the padlock on the door.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Yeah.  Ivy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Yes, Father?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Do your very best not to scream.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy is full of trepidation.  That sounded very ominous, especially coming from her father.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the Walker home, Ivy is shoving her yellow safe cloak into a large sack, along with various other items, including a \n<br/>gold pocket watch.  She wears a pretty blue gingham dress.  Her hair is disheveled.  Edward paces outside her room.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the medical building, Edward guards the door as Ivy says goodbye to Lucius.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I am leaving, to fetch you medicines.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The elders are gathered behind a building in town.  August is the last to join them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  I had a difficult time getting away.  What is it?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward takes a moment, and he sighs before he speaks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Ivy... has asked... to go to the towns... for medicines.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The elders are shocked.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy sits on resting rock in her safe cloak, waiting.  There are footsteps as two young men approach her, one bearing a \n<br/>bundle and a torch, and both wearing safe cloaks.  She stands to meet them, holding her cane.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy, Christop, and Finton approach the edge of the woods.  Ivy holds up a small sack bulging with rocks, and then sets \n<br/>her head, and leads the two men into the woods, swinging her cane back and forth to guide her.  They follow with \n<br/>trepidation, not at all comfortable with being in the woods.  Finton grabs her shoulder to stop her.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Christop.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She turns.  Christop has stopped, and is not moving further.  Ivy wants him to stay, and not to be afraid, but she is \n<br/>shaking badly herself.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Christop... you needent be scared.  We have the magic rocks.  They will keep us safe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  Why have we not heard of these rocks before?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Christop, please, do not leave us.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  There is nothing to fear.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  Then why do you wear the cloak of the safe color?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  We will light torches.  It will be safe.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop:  It is forbidden.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Christop...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Christop turns and leaves.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy and Finton stretch a tarp between some trees.  It is raining hard.  They sit underneath the tarp, waiting for \n<br/>the rain to stop.  There are noises from around them in the woods.  The rain freezes on the branches.  The forest \n<br/>is bare.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Ivy...  There's something in these woods.  It turns my stomach to rot.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He takes her hand and puts it on the bag of magic rocks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  You will be safe.  They will not harm you, because you cannot see.  They will take pity on you, the way they \n<br/>took pity on Noah, when... when he ventured into the woods.  They will kill me, Ivy.  I cannot stay.  You're better \n<br/>in these woods than most boys.  Anyone would say so.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  It is MY burden, Finton.  You may go.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finton:  Come with me?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>It is obvious now that he finds Ivy attractive.  She says nothing, so he turns and slowly leaves.  The rain has \n<br/>stopped.  When he is gone, she turns the bag over and dumps the rocks on the ground.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward (off-screen; a memory):  Do your very best not to scream.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>A door opens, and Edward leads Ivy into the old shed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  There is an odd smell.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It is ahead of you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What is it?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I cannot explain in words.  It is just a few steps.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She steps carefully forward with her hand out, and touches something, long and spiky.  She brings her fingers down to \n<br/>the bottom.  It is part of one of the creatures.  She gasps loudly and steps back.  Edward holds her.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Those We Don't Speak Of!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Do not be frightened.  It is only... farce.  Do not be frightened.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She slowly begins to calm.  There are three \"creatures\" hanging from the ceiling of the shed.  They have boar-like \n<br/>masks inside their robes, and clawed hands.  They are costumes.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward and Ivy sit outside the shed, leaning against its stone wall.  Edward is trying to explain to her, in terms she \n<br/>will understand, why things are as they are.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  There did exist rumors of creatures in these woods.  It is one of the history books I used to teach in the \n<br/>towns.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The screams?  From the woods?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We created those sounds.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The Ceremony of Meat?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We remove it ourselves.  An elder is always assigned.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy is beginning to get angry.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The drills... they are farce, too?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We did not want anyone to go to the towns, Ivy.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What about the animals.... the skinned ones?  Are the elders responsible for that, too?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I BELIEVE ONE of the elders is responsible.  It will not happen again.  There is no one in this village who \n<br/>has not lost someone irreplaceable, who has nt felt loss so deeply that they questioned the very merit of living at all.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>This strikes a chord with Ivy; it is exactly what she is going through.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It is a darkness I wished... you would never know.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He is distraught.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Forgive us our silly lies, Ivy.  They were not meant to harm.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward holds her.  She seems to come to a decision.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I am... sad for you, Papa.  For all the elders.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward places a gold pocket-watch into her hands, and hands her a folded sheet of paper.  He speaks urgently to her.  \n<br/>There are tears in her eyes, and they spill down her cheeks as he speaks to her of what she must do.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  On this paper has been written a tool of medicine.  It is common in the towns.  You will go... with two \n<br/>escorts.  Follow the sounds of a stream.  A half-day's journey will bring you to a hidden road.  At this hidden road, \n<br/>the two escorts will wait as you continue.  You alone will follow the road... and leave Covington Woods.  You are to \n<br/>tell no one in the towns where we are... and return with haste.  I cannot come with you.  You gave your heart to \n<br/>this boy.  He is in need.  Are you ready to take this burden, which by right, is yours and yours alone?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward approaches the home of Alice Hunt.  She is boiling strips of cloth to use as bandages.  He comes in.  She looks \n<br/>at him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  I am making fresh clothes for Lucius.  He needs them.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  Alice, I've sent for help.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice turns to him, hopeful.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I've sent Ivy to the towns.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  You cannot...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  It is all that I can give you.  It is all that I can give you.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  I accept.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He has stepped closer to her.  She makes to kiss him, but he turns his face.  She makes to put her head on his shoulder, \n<br/>but he leaves.  He understands the feeling that exists between them, but at the same time, without words, he is telling \n<br/>her that the feeling cannot be given voice or motion.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Back with the elders behind the building.  They are still in shock from this news.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  What have you done?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  He is the victim of a crime.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  We have agreed NEVER to go back, NEVER.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  What was the purpose of our leaving?  Let us not forget it was out of hope of something good and right.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Robert Percy:  You should not have made this decision without us.  You have gone too far.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  I'm guilty, Robert!  I made a decion of the heart!  I cannot look into another's eyes and see the same look I \n<br/>see in August's without justification!  It is too painful, I cannot bear it!  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  You have jeopardized everything we've made.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (reproachful):  Who do you think will continue this place, this life?  Do you plan to live forever?  It is in \n<br/>them that our future lies!  It is in Ivy and Lucius that this... this way of life will continue.  Yes, I have risked.  I \n<br/>hope I am always able to risk everything for the just and right cause!  If we did not make this decision, we could never \n<br/>again call ourselves innocent.  And that, in the end, is what we have protected here!  Innocence!  That, I'm not ready \n<br/>to give up.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  Let her go.  If it ends, it ends.  We can move towards hope, it's what's beautiful about this place.  We must \n<br/>not run from heartache.  You know, my brother was slain in the towns.  The rest of my family died here.  Heartache is \n<br/>a part of life.  We know that now.  Ivy's running toward hope, let her run.  If this place is worthy, she'll be \n<br/>successful in her quest.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack:  How could you have sent HER?  She's blind.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  She's more capable than most in this village... and she is led by love.  The world moves for love.  It kneels \n<br/>before it in awe.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy sits under the tarp in the dark, her hands over her ears.  Shakily, she sings the lullabye she sang to Kitty after \n<br/>Lucius refused her marriage proposal.  All around her, the forest is creaking and groaning.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  ... all the world to see.  Time look about and know.  How the shadows come and go.  How the breeze stirs the \n<br/>trees.  How the blossoms grow.  Sleep, baby, sleep.  Sleep gently sleep...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Daylight.  Ivy walks through the now-muddy forest, swinging her cane back and forth, her cloak smeared brown at the \n<br/>bottom, and smudges all over.  She walks forward to a ledge, and feeling no way beyond it, she turns to go back.  The \n<br/>ground gives way.  She shrieks, but manages to hold the edge.  The mud is too slippery to hold it for long.  She slips \n<br/>further into the hole, but she has caught her hands in some roots.  She whimpers, but manages to swing her bundle and \n<br/>cane up onto solid ground, and then she hauls herself, grunting, out of the hole.  It is very deep.  She is covered \n<br/>in mud.  Gasping, she makes her way around the hole, to a strange stumps sticking out of the ground.  The mud is all \n<br/>over her cloak.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (off-screen):  There did exist rumors of creatures in these woods.  It is in one of the history books I used \n<br/>to teach in the towns.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Grunting, crying, she tries to wipe the mud from her cloak and arms, but it is everywhere.  She cannot get it off.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Later in the day, she has let her cloak dry, and much of the mud has caked and fallen off, though there is still some.  \n<br/>She swings her cane back and forth, checking for obstacles.  There is a crack.  She taps her cane again.  It is \n<br/>broken.  She pulls it apart and drops it.  There is a rustling from the woods around her.  She searches with her hands \n<br/>for a rock, and tosses it in the direction of the sound.  The rustling comes from another direction now, louder and \n<br/>louder.  She stumbles off in a random direction, panting and whimpering, whacking branches away from her face, but \n<br/>the sound is getting closer.  She s crying now.  She stops in a small clearing.  There are red berries all around her, \n<br/>and bits of snow on the ground.  She cannot see them.  There is a growl.  She turns slowly around.  One of the \n<br/>creatures stands just at the edge of the clearing.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  It is not real.  It is not real.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She backs up and reaches a tree, and edges her way around it, facing away from the creature.  She listens around the \n<br/>edge she came from.  The creature is close, only three or four feet away.  She starts walking away, as quietly as she \n<br/>can, hoping the creature hasn't spotted her.  She gets some distance away, and then there's a crack and a roar.  It \n<br/>HAS spotted her.  She stares for some moments in the direction of the creature.  Neither move.  Then it lunges for \n<br/>her, charging.  She screams.  It slashes at her, knocking her down, but not doing any damage.  It pauses, then turns.  \n<br/>She has stood up.  It roars again, and chases her.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She keeps running, but she is losing strength.  She slows to a fast walk, not hearing the creature around her.  \n<br/>Suddenly she bumps into something.  It is the stump she felt before, when she crawled out of the hole.  She feels it \n<br/>to be sure, then gets an idea.  She drops her pack, puts her hood up, and stands just by the edge of the hole with \n<br/>her arms up.  The creature comes charging at her, roaring.  She jumps out of the way just in time.  It falls into the \n<br/>hole without a sound.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>At the quiet room, Noah's parents have brought him lunch on a tray.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Noah?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She drops the tray in shock and puts her hands to her face.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivan:  Oh my God, what is this?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Robert:  What is this?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Where is HE?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The floor of the quiet room has been pried up in one specific spot.  There are feathers underneath, and animal bones, \n<br/>and skins.  There is a bloody piece of a safe-cloak.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Robert:  He found one of the suits we kept under the floorboards.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  The animals!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>At the window, the mesh screen and wooden shutters have been pried off.  Noah has escaped.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>In the hole in the ground, Noah lays whimpering in a creature-suit, modified with feathers, skins, and bones \n<br/>everywhere.  He is bleeding, badly injured.  He whimpers and groans and cries, and finally, with the side of his face \n<br/>twitching, he dies.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy strides up to the edge of the hole, with a sturdy, pointed stick in her hands.  She holds it threateningly, but \n<br/>there are no sounds from the hole.  She lowers it.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The elders gather around Lucius in the sick-room.  He is pale, and his skin is mottled.  His mouth hangs open with his \n<br/>breathing.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  His will to live is very strong.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy strides through the forest, using the stick as a cane, tapping it against trees and ground.  Suddenly the texture \n<br/>changes.  There are rocks underfoot.  She goes back and forth to check and be sure, then drops her sack and pulls the \n<br/>watch and list out of it.  She takes off her cloak, and starts jogging down the road, using the stick to check and make \n<br/>sure she is still on the stone path.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward (off-screen; memory):  A half day's journey will bring you to a hidden road.  You alone will follow the road, and \n<br/>leave Covington woods.  You are to tell no one in the towns where we are, and return with haste.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>A fire burns in the Walker home.  Edward and Tabitha hold hands, standing by the door.  They seem to come to a decision.  \n<br/>Tabitha locks the door, and she and Edward walk into another part of the house.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy is still jogging down the road, checking every few feet to make sure she is on the right path.  She yelps, as she \n<br/>slams into an ivy-covered obstacle that flexes back and forth.  She drops the cane and checks down the sides of this \n<br/>wall to see if there is another point to get up it from.  There isn't.  She steadies herself, and grunts as she jumps \n<br/>onto the wall and climbs up.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Edward sets the locked black box down on a table, takes a key from his pocket, and opens it, reverently.  He takes a \n<br/>bundle of some kind out and hands it to Tabitha, and then a piece of a newspaper that reads, 'Billionaire Walker Shot \n<br/>to Death.'\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Mrs. Clack (voice-over):  My sister did not live past her 23rd birthday.  A group of men raped and killed her.  They \n<br/>stuffed her in a dumpster, three blocks rom our apartment.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Now we see some of the contents of the box.  There are books, papers, oil certificates, and photographs.  Edward pulls \n<br/>one particular photograph out, and holds it up to look at it.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>August:  My brother worked in an emergency room downtown.  A drug addict came in with a wound to his ribs.  My brother \n<br/>tried to dress the wound.  He pulled a gun from his jacket, then he shot my brother through his left eye.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>We see the photo now.  It is a shot of most of the elders, and the year appears to be 1980, maybe a little earlier.  \n<br/>Alice Hunt is there, holding baby Lucius in her arms.  Edward and Tabitha are there, Tabitha pregnant with Kitty.  \n<br/>Mrs. Clack and Victor stand in the background, shyly.  Robert and Vivian Percy are there.  Little Noah is not with them, \n<br/>though he probably is older than Lucius.  And August Nicholson and his wife stand off to the side.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Alice:  My husband, Michael, left for the supermarket at a quarter past nine in the morning.  He was found with no \n<br/>money and no clothes, in the East River, three days later.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  My father was shot by a business partner, who then hanged himself in my father's closet.  They had argued \n<br/>over money.  I am a professor.  I teach American History at the University of Pennsylvania.  I have an idea that I \n<br/>would like to talk to you about.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>There is a siren.  We see a view from the inside of a vehicle.  Ivy has just managed the climb to to top of the wall, \n<br/>and has dropped down on the other side.  The driver of the vehicle talks through a walkie-talkie.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  Mile 27.  There's a girl.  I'm gonna check it out.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He drives up to her, whooping his siren a few times.  She looks about in confusion.  The side of the truck reads \n<br/>Walker Wildlife Preserve.  The driver gets out and approaches, her, tidying his brown uniform.  He looks about \n<br/>twenty-two or twenty-three.  We only see him.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver (stern):  You're not allowed to go in there.  Please return to your vehicle.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (shaky):  What was that noise?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver (confused):  What are you doing out here?  How- how'd you get here?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Are you from the towns?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  Uh...  Where are you from?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Finally, we see Ivy.  There is some dirt on the edges of her sleeves and the bottom of her dress.  She clasps her \n<br/>bruised and bleeding hands together in front of her.  Her eyes are held low.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  The woods.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  You came from the woods?  In there?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Will you help me?  I need to find a doctor of medicine.  I must find these things, we must make haste.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She takes the list out of the waist of her dress.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  Listen, ma'am.  I'm just supposed to...\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He trails off.  Ivy looks very sad, but she holds the paper out to him in her hands.  He sighs and takes it from her, \n<br/>and looks at it.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver (concerned):  Is someone hurt?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy (near tears):  Please, sir, we must make haste.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  Well you... you live in there?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I do, sir.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Walkie-talkie:  Breaker.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The driver picks up his radio and brings it to his face, about to check in.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  What is your name?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Driver:  Kevin.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Kevin.  You have kindness in your voice.  I did not expect that.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin pauses a moment, but then he seems to come to a decision.  It is the right one.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  We have guard shacks every ten miles around the perimeter of the preserve.  We keep medical supplies in there \n<br/>in case of animal bites or related injuries.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy is hopeful, almost stunned.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  You can find the things written on the paper?  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin nods, but she does not see it.  He may not yet have realized that she is blind.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  You have to wait here.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Please, sir.  Please... take this as payment.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She holds out her father's pocket-watch to the young man.  He kind of smiles, wary, and looks around.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  Wait... wait you're not... you're not trickin' me are you?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I do not understand.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  What's your name?\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  Ivy.  Ivy Elizabeth Walker.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Inside the guard shack, the man on the walkie-talkie sits reading a newspaper.  It is full of horrible stories about \n<br/>murdered chldren, people dying in combat, and serial killers.  There are bad stories on the radio, too.  Kevin drives \n<br/>up.  The man looks at Kevin as he comes in.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Man:  What's with the girl?  I tried calling you back on the walkie, you didn't answer.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  OH, it was just some teenagers.  They were lost.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Man:  Can I give you some advice?  Don't get into conversations.  You start talkin', you start gettin' into how some \n<br/>estate is payin' all of us, and no one's allowed to go in there and disturb the animal sanctuary.  People's interest \n<br/>gets piqued.  It's a really easy gig, Kevin.  Maintain and protect the border.  A few years ago, it got out in the \n<br/>papers that some government guys had been paid off to keep plane routes from flying over this place.  That was a very \n<br/>stresful time for me.  Don't cause me any troubles.  Do not get into conversations.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>The man goes back to his newspaper.  Kevin walks over to the side table and munches on some snacks, all the while \n<br/>putting the items on Ivy's list in his pocket, including antibiotics.  He walks to the door, then as an afterthought, \n<br/>he turns back to his boss.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Kevin:  Hey, Jay, where's the maintenance ladder?  I n-need to fix a sign.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Jay:  It's in the back.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>Ivy makes her way back through the forest, using her stick as a guide.  She is near the stream she was told to follow.  \n<br/>The forest is quiet now.  No creatures live here.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>There is a beeping from Kevin's jeep.  The door is open, and a ladder is propped on the side.  The watch is hanging \n<br/>from his rearview mirror.  He sits there, in the middle of the road, stunned.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The elders have gathered in the sick room, keeping vigil over his frail body.  The villagers dash about outside, \n<br/>excited.  A boy runs up to the door to deliver a message.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Boy:  Ivy has returned with medicines from the towns.  She was attacked by a creature and killed it.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>He dashes off.  Vivian begins to sob over her lost son.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Vivian:  Noah.  Oh, God.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Edward:  We will find him.  We will give him... a proper burial.  We will tell the others... he was killed by the \n<br/>creatures.  Your son has made our stories real.  Noah has given us a chance to continue this place.  If that is \n<br/>something... we still wish for.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>One by one, the elders stand.  Robert stands, too, and then Vivian.  There son's sacrifice will not be in vain.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy, cloak gone, makes her way inside, and hands the sack with medicines to August.  She is led to Lucius, and takes \n<br/>his hand, crying.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>Ivy:  I'm back, Lucius.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>She smiles.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>---\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>End credits roll.  \n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Village, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=M.
