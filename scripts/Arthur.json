MANHATTAN - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top\r\n          broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in\r\n          Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.\r\n                         \r\n          The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.\r\n                         \r\n          A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S\r\n          BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the\r\n          wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.\r\n                         \r\n          BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.\r\n                         \r\n          We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches\r\n          and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.\r\n                         \r\n          Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.\r\n                         \r\n          The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New\r\n          York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's\r\n          steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of\r\n          the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze\r\n          testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.\r\n                         \r\n          The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER\r\n          COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.\r\n                         \r\n          A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROOKIE COP\r\n           Cooool.\r\n                         \r\n          An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a\r\n          FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window.

Okay, okay.\r\n                         \r\n          Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze\r\n          bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman\r\n          utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip\r\n          flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red\r\n          stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.\r\n                         \r\n                          OLDER COP 1\r\n           Okay, explain everything.\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n           Well.

I didn't mean for it\r\n           to get to this! I planned to just\r\n           be your friend but then I started\r\n           to fall for you and I thought `I\r\n           can't marry Susan, I might fall for\r\n           Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to\r\n           marry Susan or I'll be poor so I\r\n           won't fall for Naomi' But then I\r\n           did fall for you! Because you're\r\n           brainy and funny and gorgeous and\r\n           too smart to do walking tours.\r\n           You're too smart, Snart. Smart\r\n           Snart.

Then she said `Noooo, if\r\n           you don't marry Susan, I'll make\r\n           you pay all the inheritance money\r\n           back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.\r\n           Okay she didn't laugh but she might\r\n           as well have, the evil cow.

ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          It's a few weeks later. The place is very, very messy. The\r\n          place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of\r\n          paint.\r\n                         \r\n          SPLOTCH! A big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant\r\n          teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered.\r\n                         \r\n          Arthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army\r\n          paintball tank. He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint\r\n          at the teddy. The tank turret rotates. He shoots walls,\r\n          possessions, furniture. He stops.\r\n           96.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n           Would Frog ever get up again? Or\r\n           would he just sit in his tank,\r\n           crying and soiling himself until he\r\n           died of dehydration because he\r\n           didn't even have the energy to eat\r\n           a wet sandwich.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks down at an ashes urn.\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n           Hobson!

Angrily he spins the\r\n          turret through 360 degrees, firing paint.\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n           Arrrrgghhh!\r\n                         \r\n          Marty comes in - and is hit hard by paint.\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)\r\n           Sorry.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARTY\r\n           How's the tea?\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n           Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.\r\n                         \r\n                          MARTY\r\n           Want to talk about the Cubs game?\r\n                         \r\n                          ARTHUR\r\n           Nahhh.
