INT. GLOBE NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DUSK - N.Y.\n</b>\nA row of newspaper delivery trucks is lined up against the\nlong loading bay, waiting for the edition.  In the foreground\na large clock establishes the time as 8:10 PM. A rumbling\nnoise warns the men to take their positions; a few seconds\nlater the bales of newspapers come sliding the spiral chutes\nonto the moving belts from which they are manhandled onto\nthe trucks.  Much noise and shouting.\n\nThe front truck moves out to the city street.  As it does\nCAMERA EMPHASIZES the big poster on its side.  The design\nfeatures a large pair of spectacles with heavy rims - a\ntrademark of Hunsecker's. (It will later be seen as the\nmasthead of the gossip column.)\n\n<b>                     \"GO WITH THE GLOBE\"\n</b>\n                            Read\n\n<b>                       J.J.

Some shots\nare of the vehicle moving through very heavy traffic (taken\nfrom a camera car).  Others are from the inside of the\ntruck; as it slows down, the delivery man tosses the heavy\nbundle of papers onto the sidewalk.  CAMERA following the\ntruck, holds it in foreground against the blazing electric\nsigns of Broadway and Times Square.\n\n<b>EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe southeast corner of the intersection of Broadway and\n46th Street, CAMERA, fairly high, shoots north towards the\nimpressive vista of electric signs, silhouetted against the\ndarkening sky.  Very heavy traffic and crowded sidewalks.\nCAMERA descends towards the Orange Juice stand on the\ncorner, passing the booth which sells souvenir hats.  It\nmoves through the congestion of chattering passersby,\nsteadily approaching a smartly dressed young man, who stands\nat the counter of the Orange Juice stand.  Oblivious of the\nhub-bub around him, SIDNEY FALCO is concerned only with his\nprivate problems.\n\nHe turns sharply as a newspaper truck pulls up at the curb\nbehind him; this is what he has been waiting for...\n\n<b>CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe news truck delivery man tosses a bundle out onto the\nsidewalk besides a newsstand.\n\n<b>DETAIL\n</b>\nThe bundle of newspapers.  It hits the sidewalk with a smack.\nCAMERA PULLS BACK as Sidney Falco crosses the sidewalk.  The\nowner of the newsstand, IGGY, comes to pick up the bundle;\nhe is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor;\nSidney snaps his fingers with impatience.  Iggy wears\nspectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to\ngrope for the cord that binds the papers.\n\n<b>                         IGGY\n</b>            Aw Lady, if I looked like you, I'd--\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            C'mon...C'mon...\n\n<b>                         IGGY\n</b>                   (recognizing Sidney's voice)\n            Keep ya sweatshirt on, Sidney.\n\nMajestically taking his time, Iggy lifts the bundle to his\nstand and cuts the cord.\n\n<b>                         IGGY\n</b>            Hey, Fresh, the Globe just came\n            in -- Hey, Sidney, want an item for\n            Hunsecker's column?  Two rolls get\n            fresh with a baker!  Hey, hot, hot,\n            hot -- etc.\n\nAnnoyed, Sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and\nreturns briskly to the orange juice stand.\n\n<b>ORANGE JUICE STAND - NIGHT\n</b>\nSidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by\nnewcomers.  Rudely, he recovers his half-consumed glass of\norange juice and sandwich.  He takes them further down the\ncounter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the\npaper.  CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM, picks up further snatches of\noverheard dialogue. (See dialogue attached at the end of the\nscene) We move close enough to see Sidney's hands open the\npaper expertly at HUNSECKER'S column - identifiable by the\npicture of the spectacled eyes.  Over scene there is a\nbabble of offstage dialogue.\n\n<b>CLOSE UP OF SIDNEY\n</b>\nHis face is sullen as his eyes run rapidly down the column.\nHe is reacting to a not unexpected disappointment.\n\n<b>EXT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - BROADWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nCAMERA SHOOTS WEST on 46th Street, as Sidney comes down the\nside street from the newsstand in background.  Irritably, he\njerks open the door of a shabby entrance.  As the glass door\ncloses, Sidney is seen striding up the stairs.\n\n<b>FIRST FLOOR - OUTSIDE SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nBeside the top of the stairs is the door to Sidney's office.\nOn it there is a cheaply printed cardboard sign which reads:\n\n<b>SIDNEY FALCO\n</b>\nPublicity\n\nFrom inside comes the sound of desultory typing.  Sidney\ncomes up the stairs two at a time and turns into the door.\n\n<b>INT. SIDNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nSALLY is on the phone as Sidney strides in.\n\n<b>                         SALLY\n</b>            Just a minute, Mr. Weldon.

No, I\n            asked Hunsecker to withhold the\n            item, until he could give it a\n            fine, fat paragraph.  The column\n            was running over and I didn't want\n            you kissed off with just a line...\n\n<b>INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nRobard is a stolid, secure man, balding and with a moustache.\nHe has a morose sense of humor.  He is speaking from a\ntelephone on a little desk at the end of the bar.  In\nbackground, the Club is open, but there are few customers as\nyet.  Some recorded jazz is being played while the musicians\nare still arriving, strolling past in background, depositing\ntheir overcoats and music cases in the little closet assigned\nto them.\n\n<b>                         ROBARD\n</b>                   (in answer to Sidney)\n            Of course.\n                   (he listens to\n                   protest from Sidney)\n            What is this, Sidney, a kissing\n            game?  You're a liar - that's a\n            publicity man's nature.  I wouldn't\n            hire you if you wasn't a liar.

But\n            also in the sense that you are a\n            personal liar, too, because you\n            don't do the work I pay you for.\n                   (new protests on the\n                   other end of the line)\n            Oh, stop it, Sidney.

As the dissolve clears, a clatter of polite\napplause greets the end of a previous number.  CAMERA is on\nthe bandstand, moving smoothly through the group of five\nmusicians as the rhythm of a new number is set up: first the\nleader (a guitarist) snaps his fingers, giving the tempo\nto...the bass, who \"walks\" with the beat, bringing in...the\ndrums, which start a quiet, insistent wire-brush background\nfor...the cello and the flute, whose introductory phrases,\nset the stage for...\n\n<b>STEVE DALLAS\n</b>\n...the guitar, the leader again.  It comes in after this\nshort preamble with the first statement of melody. (The tune\nhas a faint echo of significance because it is one of the\nthemes of the film, already heard as a phrase in the\nbackground score of the title music.) CAMERA lingers a\nmoment on the guitarist, STEVE DALLAS.  He is a youth of\npleasant, intelligent appearance.  He plays with the intent\nair of the contemporary jazz musician who takes his work\nvery seriously indeed and affects a much greater interest in\nthe music and his fellow musicians than in the listening\naudience.\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nA close shot.  Sidney has just entered the club, strolling\ninto the vestibule near the entrance.  He wears an expression\nof oddly unsuitable antagonism, as he looks forward...\n\n<b>DALLAS\n</b>\nSeen in long shot from Sidney's viewpoint.  CAMERA moves to\ninclude Sidney in foreground again.  He turns as he is\naccosted by RITA, the cigarette girl of the club.

Sidney\ncomes up behind him.  We see Sidney's eyes flick from\nD'Angelo towards the bandstand and back again.  Then, as he\ntakes the stool next to D'Angelo, he assumes a different\nmanner, a sulky resentment.

He turns away\nfrom D'Angelo as she whispers to him.  As she departs,\nSidney turns back.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            If you knew Hunsecker as well as I\n            did, you might understand why it's\n            my business.  Maybe you're walking\n            around blind, Frank, without a cane.\n\nSidney gets off his stool.  Casually, but to effect, he adds:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            ...and in case you didn't know it,\n            Susie Hunsecker's out there on the\n            back step right now.\n\nHe turns away, glancing towards Steve on the bandstand\nbehind him.\n\n<b>D'ANGELO\n</b>\nHe looks disturbed.\n\n<b>INT./EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD\n</b>\nFrom D'Angelo's point of view.  CAMERA LOOKS UP at Steve.\nThe Quintet is now reaching the end of the number, a driving\nrhythm of considerable excitement.  A waiter passes in f.g.\nand the CAMERA CRANES BACK through the curtained doorway to\nthe backstage part of the club.  This movement is continued\nas we see some other employees, including Jerry Wiggins, the\nintermission pianist, who is waiting in the corridor near\nthe fire-exit.  As he steps out of the door to discard a\ncigarette, CAMERA AGAIN CONTINUES ITS MOVEMENT, CRANING BACK\nAND DOWNWARD into the little courtyard.  Here, it discovers\nthe figure of a young woman who is waiting in the shadow\nnear the steps of the fire-escape, listening to the music.\n\n<b>CLOSER ANGLE\n</b>\nThis is SUSAN HUNSECKER.  She wears an expensive mink coat.\nIt is oddly in contrast with her personality; the face is\nsensitive and intelligent, but childlike and tragic.  A girl\nin adolescence already burdened with problems beyond her\ncapacity.  Over scene, the music continues.  Susan shifts\nher position, knowing that the session will soon be at an\nend and that the musicians will be coming backstage.\n\n<b>INT. ELYSIAN ROOM\n</b>\nSteve is playing the last bars of the number; the whole\ngroup now in unison.\n\n<b>QUINTET\n</b>\nThe music comes sharply, dramatically to its finish.  There\nis some applause.  The boys relax.  Steve reaches for the\nmicrophone and in the characteristically casual manner of\nthe \"cool\" musician, announces the end of the set, thanking\nthe audience, identifying the quintet by name and introducing\nthe intermission pianist.  During this, Carson, Chico and\nPaul wander off the bandstand behind him.\n\n<b>EXT. BACKSTAGE AND COURTYARD\n</b>\nChico, Paul and Carson come through to the corridor backstage.\nAs they do so, Chico, glancing out of the open door sees\nSusan in the courtyard.  He goes out onto the fire-escape;\nPaul following behind.\n\n<b>                         CHICO\n</b>            Hi!  Susie...\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>            Hello, Chico.

Paul remains with\nSusan.  There is a momentary silence; Paul is embarrassed\nbecause Susan is.  Susan makes an effort at conversation,\nshe nods towards the club.\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>            Full house...?\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>            Packin' 'em in.\n\n<b>INT. CLUB\n</b>\nSteve has been trapped by a young woman in spectacles, a\nmuch-too-earnest devotee of progressive jazz.\n\n<b>                         DEVOTEE\n</b>            I'm terribly interested in jazz --\n            serious jazz.  You studied with\n            Milhaud, didn't you?  This is such\n            an interesting fusion of the\n            traditional, classical form with\n            the new progressive style, I just\n            wanted to ask you how you came to\n            form the group...-\n\n<b>CHICO\n</b>\nHe comes through the curtains of the doorway, pausing as he\nsees that Steve is involved with the Intellectual Young Woman.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nSteve glancing at Chico over the shoulder of the Intellectual\nYoung Woman.  Seeing that Chico has something to say to him,\nhe wriggles out of the young woman's clutches by passing the\nbuck to the unfortunate to Fred Katz, who is descending from\nthe bandstand behind him.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>            Well, we just sort of got together.\n                   (turning to introduce Fred)\n            Maybe if you ask Mr. Katz...He\n            writes the stuff, you know.\n\n<b>                         FRED\n</b>                   (blankly)\n            Huh?\n\n<b>RESUME CHICO\n</b>\nSteve joins Chico and they go through the curtains into the\ncorridor outside.\n\n<b>CORRIDOR\n</b>\nChico, smiling, explains:\n\n<b>                         CHICO\n</b>            Don't waste your time there, man.\n            You've got something better waiting\n            outside...\n                   (as Steve looks at him)\n            Susie's out there.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>\nHis reaction betrays some emotion. (Over scene the\nintermission pianist has begun to play a Blues number.)\nSteve moves a quick step towards the door to the courtyard,\nthen hesitates - almost as if he was afraid to go out.  He\nmeets Chico's eye again.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>            What did she say...?\n\n<b>CHICO\n</b>\nHe is amused, but sympathetic.\n\n<b>                         CHICO\n</b>            You proposed to her, not me.\n                   (slapping him on the back)\n            Go get your answer...\n\n<b>COURTYARD\n</b>\nSusan, waiting at the foot of the iron steps, turns as Steve\ncomes out on the fire escape above.  Steve comes quickly\ndown the steps towards her, slowing down when he gets a few\npaces away from her.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nShe looks up at Steve.\n\n<b>STEVE\n</b>\nA CLOSE SHOT.  In his expression we read his mute inquiry...\n\n<b>RESUME SUSAN\n</b>\nQuite deliberately, with her eyes moistened by love and\naffection...she nods.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nGreat relief and happiness can be seen in the boy's face.\nAfter a moment, he moves to her and she to him.  They\nembrace swiftly, hold each other close and then kiss with\npassion.  Presently, when the kiss is over, Susan speaks\nsoftly.\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (in a whisper)\n            Steve...I'll...I'll try to make a\n            good wife.\n\nSteve is still too choked with relief to speak.  For answer,\nhe clasps her more tightly to him.  The beam of light which\nfalls on the iron stairs behind them, narrows and then is\nextinguished...\n\n<b>CORRIDOR\n</b>\nPaul has closed the door.  Turning, he shares a look with\nthe grinning Chico and Fred Katz who has managed to escape\nfrom the young woman.  Before there is time for either of\nthem to make a remark, Sidney comes through the curtains\nfrom the Club.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Hi, Fellows.  Where's the Chief?\n\nSidney's manner is very friendly.  But it is immediately\napparent from the reaction of the other three boys that none\nof them likes Sidney.

When he is out of sight or the group\nin the courtyard, his manner swiftly changes.  It's obvious\nnow that his indignation was assumed; now he looks back\ntowards the courtyard and there is shrewdness in his eyes;\nhe is assessing Steve's temper.  But, presently, seeing\nD'Angelo and the boys returning, he moves back to the\ncurtains into the Club.\n\n<b>COURTYARD\n</b>\nAs D'Angelo and the other boys go inside, Steve turns back\nto Susan.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>                   (fondly)\n            Just so you don't leave me in a\n            minor key.\n\n<b>INT. CLUB\n</b>\nRita has succeeded in recapturing Sidney near the entrance\nto the club.  Sidney, alert and interested, listens to her\nwhile keeping his eye on the bandstand in b.g. where the\nintermission pianist is finishing his performance and the\nquintet are returning, ready to mount the bandstand again.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Don't tell me you started a polka\n            with Leo Bartha?\n\n<b>                         RITA\n</b>                   (shaking her head)\n            No.  That's what I mean - I'm being\n            fired for what I didn't do.\n\nSidney is amused.

Susan has come back into the club\nwith Steve and seems to be taking leave of him.  She starts\nto walk through the club on her way out.\n\n<b>RESUME SIDNEY AND RITA\n</b>\nSidney, with half his attention on Susan and Steve, listens\nto Rita's rueful protest.\n\n<b>                         RITA\n</b>                   (rapidly)\n            He was furious and, by the time I\n            could have put on a Tropical Island\n            mood, I was out on the street!...\n                   (dolefully)\n            That night Mr. Van Cleve calls me\n            into his office here.

I told him I still\n            have Sonny at military academy, but\n            Van Cleve's made of ice...\n\nAware that Sidney is moving to leave her so that he can\ncatch Susan, Rita detains him with an appeal:\n\n<b>                         RITA\n</b>                   (tentative)\n            Do you think you could do something,\n            Sidney?\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (a quick nod)\n            That's what I'm thinking, Rita.\n            Maybe...\n\nRita is anxious to cement the offer.  Delicately, she asks:\n\n<b>                         RITA\n</b>            Do you still keep your key under\n            the mat?\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (eyeing her)\n            Can you be there by two-thirty?\n\nShe drops her eyes, nods.  Sidney pats her arm and is gone.\nShe looks after him.\n\n<b>SIDNEY AND SUSAN\n</b>\nSidney overtakes Susan at the front entrance in time to open\nthe door for her.  He has now reverted to another mood in\nwhich he appears to be sulking over the insult delivered to\nhim by Steve.  He goes out ahead of her.\n\n<b>BANDSTAND\n</b>\nThe quintet are resuming their positions on the stand.\nSteve lingers a moment, his guitar already in his hand while\nhe talks to D'Angelo.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>            Frank, I don't want any secrets\n            from you.

(The Sage.)\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nWhile D'Angelo watches him, the boy continues.  CAMERA\ntracks slowly back through the club as the chatter and\nbabble of the customers begins to diminish in appreciation\nof the quiet melancholy of the music.\n\n<b>OUTSIDE THE ELYSIAN ROOM\n</b>\nSusan is standing beside the poster which features Steve,\nlistening to the music from inside the club.  Sidney comes\nto join her.  He is now pretending to be hurt.\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>            You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so\n            touchy...\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (gruffly)\n            I wasn't looking for a brawl.

Sidney moves forward to\nescort her to the taxi.\n\n<b>LONGER SHOT\n</b>\nThey cross the sidewalk and get into the cab.  It starts off\nand CAMERA PANS with it.\n\n<b>INSIDE CAB\n</b>\nSusan is relaxed, content but thoughtful.  Sidney flicks her\na quick, anxious look.  Finally, gloomily:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Feels like a Monday night, don't\n            it...?\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (softly)\n            Not to me.  Sometimes, the world\n            feels like a cage.

Susan drops her eyes,\nbecoming absorbed in her own problems.  Cautiously, Sidney\nlets the momentary silence continue.  Then:\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (thoughtfully)\n            Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (glibly)\n            Frankly, yes, to my surprise.

Then Susan nods.  She is not looking at Sidney and\ncannot see the watchfulness in his face.

Sidney\nmaneuvers his way between the parked cars towards the\nentrance and the CAMERA DESCENDS to SHOOT ALONG the courtyard\ntowards the entrance.  We see the figure of Jimmy Weldon and\nhis girl friend coming out of the Club.\n\n<b>CLOSER ANGLE - NIGHT\n</b>\nJimmy Weldon is coming out of the Club accompanied by a\ngirl; he is slightly tight.  As he steps through the outer\ndoors, Weldon again spies Sidney on the sidewalk; he steps\nto one side of the entrance way.\n\nSidney slips through the congestion, but just as he tries to\nenter the Club, Weldon's hand shoots out, neatly ambushing\nhim, pulling him aside into the narrow courtyard.  Sidney is\ninstantly resentful of this manhandling, but has to adjust\nhimself, assuming a quick smile for the benefit of Weldon.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Jimmy!

TWENTY ONE CLUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nSidney, entering the Club, threads his way through the\ncrowded foyer, coming up to CAMERA near the foot of the\nstaircase.

He pauses.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Shooting through the doorway into\nthe restaurant, we can see the group at the table.\n(Hunsecker's back is turned to us.) CAMERA PULLS BACK to\ninclude Sidney in foreground.  He decides not to go into\nrestaurant and turns away out of shot.\n\n<b>INT.

He hears the connection\nmade, speaks at once.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (to phone)\n            J.J.?  It's me --\n\nWe are close enough to the instrument to hear the sound of a\nvoice on the other end.  Though the words are not\ndistinguishable, it is quite clear that the speaker is not\ntalking to the phone.  Sidney seems to relax, as if this is\nsomething that happens often.  He waits, studying his\nmanicured fingertips...\n\nPresently Sidney hears the voice on the other end become\nclearer.  It asks: \"Yes?\" CAMERA moves closer as Sidney says:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            J.J., it's Sidney.  Can you come\n            outside for one minute?\n\nHunsecker's voice, filtered through the sound of the\ntelephone, is sharp and tiny; but the words are now very\nclear.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)\n</b>            Can I come out?

Sidney, more\nslowly, also hangs up.  Brooding, he comes out of the booth.\n\n<b>INT. TWENTY ONE CLUB - LOUNGE\n</b>\nSidney comes out of the door to the phone booths, walks\nthrough the lounge to the hallway.  He turns towards the\ndining room.\n\n<b>INT. HALLWAY\n</b>\nSidney comes to the door into the dining room, CAMERA\ntracking with him.  Here he pauses, looking towards...\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  Hunsecker is seated at a table\nwhich is cleverly his habitual position.  We see him only in\nsemi-back view, a broad and powerful back.  He is listening\nto a man who has paused at his table, stooping over Hunsecker\nto whisper in his ear.  As the columnist listens, his hands\nplay with an omni-present pad and pencil which lie on the\ndinner table amongst an assortment of envelopes, mimeographed\nsheets and a telephone.  Beyond Hunsecker and the man\ntalking to him are the SENATOR, the AGENT, and an attractive,\nif fatuous GIRL.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            I'll check it in the morning, Low -\n            thanks.\n\nThe man leaves; Hunsecker is scribbling a note on the pad.\nMeanwhile the Senator whispers something to the girl, who\ngiggles softly.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nSidney comes across to the table, nervous but deliberate.\nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Hunsecker in foreground.\nSidney, without accosting him, stands a few feet from the\ncolumnist's elbow and deliberately lights a cigarette.\nHunsecker, barely turning his head, sees him.  We have heard\nof Hunsecker as a monster, but he is evidently in a mild\nphase of his metabolism, for he seems gentle, sad and quiet,\nas he turns his gaze casually to the Senator, totally\nignoring the young man who stands behind him.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (softly)\n            Harvey, I often wish I were dead\n            and wore a hearing aid...with a\n            simple flick of a switch I could\n            shut out the greedy murmur of\n            little men...\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nA close shot.  Sidney shows no reaction to this insult.

J.J. turns - but\nnot to Sidney.  He raises his hand in a small gesture which\nsummons a passing Captain, who steps into picture at Sidney's\nelbow.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Mac!  I don't want this man at my\n            table...\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (quickly but quietly interrupting)\n            I have a message from your sister.\n\nThe Captain is already there.  But now Hunsecker's eyes have\nswitched to Sidney's face.  For the briefest of moments,\nnothing happens.  Then Hunsecker, seeming to relax and\nignoring the Captain whom he has summoned, turns back to\ncasual conversation with the Senator as if nothing had\nhappened.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Forgive me, Harvey.  We were\n            interrupted before -\n\nIn foreground, Sidney turns to the Captain with a carved\nsmile, indicating that Hunsecker's change of topic is to be\ninterpreted as sanction for Sidney to remain.  The Captain,\nnot entirely convinced, retreats.  Sidney finds himself a\nchair, places it and takes a seat which is near enough to\nthe table to establish his presence.  During this:\n\n<b>                         SENATOR\n</b>                   (who is mildly\n                   surprised and faintly embarrassed)\n            Err...the Supreme Court story, I\n            was telling you - Justice Black.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (nodding)\n            Yes, the Justice, that's right.\n            But I think you had it in the column.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (smoothly, casually)\n            Last July, the lead item...\n\nSidney's interjection is quietly well-mannered.  Hunsecker\ntotally ignores it.  The other members of the party are a\nlittle astonished at the interplay.  The girl, in particular,\nis fascinated; she clearly admires Sidney's looks.  The\nSenator, noting this, glances at Sidney, accepting the point:\n\n<b>                         SENATOR\n</b>                   (laughing)\n            And I believe that's precisely\n            where I read it, too.

It's the charming\n            street urchin's face.  It's part of\n            his \"helpless\" act - he throws\n            himself on your mercy.  I skip the\n            pleading nervous bit that sometimes\n            blends over into bluster.  The\n            moist grateful eye is a favorite\n            face with him - it frequently ties\n            in with the act of boyish candor:\n            he's talking straight from the\n            heart, get it?  He's got about\n            half-a-dozen faces for the ladies,\n            but the real cut one to me is the\n            quick dependable chap - nothing he\n            won't do for you in a pinch.

He sits\nwith his agent, (AL EVANS) a small, worried, bespectacled\nman, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself.

In background, beyond, Steve and\nD'Angelo are walking up the aisle to the exit.  CAMERA\nTRACKS CLOSE on Sidney and Hunsecker.  Hunsecker's face is\nrigid.  Sidney, close at his elbow, whispers:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (softly)\n            You did it, J.J., you did it good...\n\nSidney is full of confidence.  But Hunsecker barely hears\nhim (Hunsecker has been hurt very deeply by the boy's\nattack; in particular, by the appalling fear that what Steve\nhas said is the kind of thing which Susan may also secretly\nbelieve.)\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nSusan is still standing in the wings.  Mary is with her,\nobviously sympathetic.  The girl is drying her eyes with\nKleenex, and Mary glances at her employer with a look of\nreproach.  Hunsecker walks round the table, obviously trying\nto approach Susan; seeing this, Susan turns away and moves\nfurther from him.  Hunsecker stops.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nThere is some emotion in his face as he looks towards the\ngirl.  More gently, he moves forward past CAMERA...\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nSensing the approach of Hunsecker behind her, she moves away\nagain; she is still crying, but is trying to recover.\nPresently Hunsecker approaches her again.  He speaks very\ngently, soothingly, comforting...\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (softly)\n            You in a mood, Susie, to run over\n            to Milgrim's later and buy a few\n            new frocks?\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (a small voice)\n            No.  I'm going home.\n\nHunsecker again tries to come nearer to her.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Want Sidney to drive you over?\n\nIgnoring the shake of her head, he calls to Sidney.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Drive Susie home.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nAgain we see some emotion in his face as he studies the girl.\nHis eyes flick towards the stage behind him where Sidney\nstands watching.  He moves gently forward and then speaks in\na quiet voice which reveals how desperately he needs her\nreassurance:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Susie...I...I'd have to take it\n            very much amiss if you ever saw\n            that boy again.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nAfter a pause, she turns towards him; she looks him straight\nin the face.\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (levelly)\n            I'll never see him again.\n\n<b>RESUME HUNSECKER\n</b>\nHe seems to take this as a gesture of forgiveness from her.\nNow he touches her.  His need for her is apparent; he tries\nto reach her, tries to find an excuse to embrace her.  She\nsubmits to this very passively.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nA VERY CLOSE SHOT.  We see the effort with which she is\ncontrolling herself.\n\n<b>RESUME TWO SHOT\n</b>\nSatisfied with this crumb of affection from his sister,\nHunsecker lets her go.  Susan moves away, still avoiding his\neyes.  Then she goes off towards the steps down into the\nauditorium.  Sidney looks at Hunsecker, then after Susan and\nfollows her.\n\n<b>RESUME HUNSECKER\n</b>\nHe goes back to Mary and the script.  He instructs her:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Call Van Cleve.  Tell him he was\n            right.  Tell him I said the Dallas\n            boys are not worthy of his club.\n\nPoring over the typewritten pages, he senses Mary's eyes on\nhim.  He speaks to her quietly without raising his head and\nthere is still an undertone of feeling in his voice:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (without looking up)\n            Mary...for Susie's own good...don't\n            give her misplaced sympathy...\n\nMary says nothing.  Hunsecker gathers his papers and with a\nvisible effort to resume his public personality turns\ntowards the machinery of the television broadcast in\nbackground.\n\n<b>INT. TV THEATRE FOYER\n</b>\nSusan crosses towards the doors out onto the street.  Sidney\ncomes behind her, watchful as he overtakes her near the\ndoors.  He goes past her to open the door for her.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            I'll get you a cab...\n\nSusan stops dead.\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>                   (coldly)\n            Get away from me.\n\nShe goes out into the street.  Beyond, we see a crushing cab.\nHesitating, Sidney adds:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            J.J. asked me to drive you over\n            and -\n\nBut Susan has already moved out of shot, hurrying across the\nsidewalk to hail the taxi.\n\n<b>RESUME SIDNEY\n</b>\nUncertain what to do, whether to follow her or not, he moves\nafter her.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nShe has already opened the door of the taxi.  She turns to\nsee Sidney come up behind her.  As he enters SHOT, she\nrepeats:\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>            I told you to leave!  I don't know\n            if Steve'll ever talk to me again\n            and I'm ready to blame it all on you!\n\nShe starts to get into the cab...\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nAlert, he moves to detain her (anxious to know exactly the\nextent of her suspicion.)\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Susie...!\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nAs Sidney steps up, he grasps at the door of the taxi,\ntrying to hold it open, but Susan pulls it shut, catching\nhis fingers in the door.  Sidney steps back in pain...\n\n<b>TAXI\n</b>\nIt drives off down Sixth Avenue.\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nNursing the injury to his hand, he looks after the\ndisappearing taxi.  As he recovers from the pain, his\nexpression slowly changes to one of thoughtful appraisal.\n(Susan's suspicions maybe of less importance than some other\nconsiderations.)\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.

The coat appears to have some significance\nfor him; Sidney is under tension.\n\nA waiter, carrying a carton of beer cans, comes out of the\ndoorway just behind Sidney, moving between him and the\novercoat.  Thus interrupted, Sidney turns away.\n\n<b>INT. ROBARD'S CLUB - NIGHT\n</b>\nRobard is standing at the bar, surrounded by a group of his\ncronies.

He takes his own coat and, as he thrusts his arm\ninto the sleeve, contrives neatly to slip some unseen object\ninto the pocket of Steve's overcoat; CAMERA notes the\ngesture, but only very briefly.

Once\nmore his face goes tense. (He asks himself, does this\ndevelopment - which he himself anticipated - change the\nsituation?) He turns away, moving out of shot.\n\n<b>ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\nCAMERA moves with Sidney as he walks towards the doorway.\nThere he hesitates again; he looks back into the club.\n\n<b>DALLAS\n</b>\nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  A LONG SHOT of Steve on the\nbandstand.  CAMERA PANS deliberately towards the coatrack in\nf.g.  A group of newly arrived musicians walk into the shot,\nsetting down their instrument cases and starting to hang up\ntheir coats. (Clearly, Sidney could not now return to the\ncoat rack - even if he decided that he did want to undo his\nhandiwork.)\n\n<b>RESUME SIDNEY\n</b>\nCAMERA, shooting out across the square, frames Sidney in f.g.\nFacing the inevitable, Sidney turns away, walks across the\nsidewalk.

He\nremains in this position, waiting for the elevator, but now\n(believing himself to be alone) he leans his head against\nthe wall and begins to weep, quietly.

Sidney moves closer to her.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            But what are you going to do?\n\nThere are some tears of pity in Susan's eyes.  Once more she\nmoves away from Sidney.  Sidney senses that her compassion\nfor Hunsecker might easily lead her once again to slip back\ninto the trap.  He insists:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (with emphasis)\n            You don't owe your brother a cup of\n            water!\n\nAnother pause.  Sidney again repeats:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            What are you going to do?\n\nShe moves away from Sidney, CAMERA following her.  After a\nmoment, she answers:\n\n<b>                         SUSAN\n</b>            Go to Steve.\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nSidney is moved, having done his solitary act of chivalry.\nTo hide his feelings, he is harsh:\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>                   (sharply)\n            For Pete's sake, straighten out the\n            seams of your stockings - comb your\n            hair - don't be so helpless all the\n            time!\n\nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Susan.  From the other room, we\nhear the telephone ring.  Sidney turns and goes quickly out.\nAfter a moment, Susan looks back at the door through which\nSidney has disappeared.\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nHunsecker is framed in foreground, speaking into the\ntelephone.  Sidney is in background, outside the door of\nSusan's bedroom.  Hunsecker is fully aware of Sidney's\npresence, as he says:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (to phone)\n            No, he's admitted that, Harry.  My\n            kid sister's a witness.\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nA CLOSE SHOT.  He watches Hunsecker with a curious detachment.\nProducing a cigarette, he lights it and then looks up\ntowards Hunsecker.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)\n</b>                   (over scene)\n            No, he admits he planted the stuff\n            on the Dallas boy...\n\n<b>RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY\n</b>\nHunsecker framed in foreground, Sidney beyond.  Hunsecker\nhas at the same time been tapping a cigarette on the desk.\nSidney walks across to Hunsecker, offers the lighted match.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER - REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nAs he accepts the light he continues speaking to the phone:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Yeah...jealousy.\n\n<b>RESUME HUNSECKER AND SIDNEY\n</b>\nSidney turns on his heel, walking out of the apartment.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            ...He's been trying to make my\n            sister behind my back.\n\n<b>CAFE ON BROADWAY\n</b>\nKello is in a phone booth.\n\n<b>                         KELLO\n</b>                   (to phone)\n            Oh, that's serious, J.J.  Real\n            reprehensible...\n\nKello leans out of the booth into the cafe signaling through\nthe window to the street outside where the squad car pulls\nahead to a position ready for him outside the door.\n\n<b>                         KELLO\n</b>                   (to phone)\n            Don't worry, I'll get there.  I'm\n            on Broadway now.\n\nKello hangs up.  Hurries out.  We see him get into the squad\ncar which rapidly accelerates.\n\n<b>INT. HUNSECKER'S LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nHunsecker has hung up.  He stares at the telephone for a\nmoment.  Then he moves towards Susan's door, CAMERA TRACKING\nwith him.  He comes to the threshold, looks at Susan who is\nstanding in much the same position in which Sidney left her.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nUnaware that her brother is watching her, she picks up the\nfur coat on the bed. (She is about to start packing her\nbelongings.) She turns as she hears Hunsecker speak.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (over scene)\n            That's a pretty coat.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nSHOOTING ACROSS Susan, towards Hunsecker.

I'll see you\n            for breakfast around eleven.\n\nWithout waiting for a response, Hunsecker goes out, closing\nthe door.  Susan stares at it for a moment.  Then she moves\nto get a small suitcase which she lays on the bed.\n\n<b>TERRACE\n</b>\nHunsecker opens the windows onto the terrace, comes out and\nlooks over the parapet, (looking to see how far Sidney has\ngot, hoping to see Kello's squad car.)\n\n<b>RESUME SUSAN\n</b>\nShe completes her simple packing, closing the suitcase.\nWith a gesture that is obviously automatic, she starts to\nput on the fur coat; then she halts, realizing what she is\ndoing.  She pauses; CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  Now, deliberately\nshe throws the coat back on the bed.  CAMERA PANS down with\nthe gesture.  She looks down at the coat, the discarded\nsymbol of her dependence upon her brother.  CAMERA PULLS\nBACK again as she takes a quick look round, then goes to\ntake a duffle coat from the wardrobe.  She throws this over\nher arm, picks up the suitcase, goes to the door.\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nSusan comes out of the door.  She moves with a sober\ndetermination, expecting to find Hunsecker in the room.\nCAMERA TRACKS with her.  But then she realizes that Hunsecker\nhas gone out on the terrace.  She takes a step or two\ntowards him, then pauses.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nFrom Susan's viewpoint, SHOOTING through the big glass\nwindows.  Hunsecker is at the parapet.  He is impatiently\nlooking down into Broadway.\n\n<b>SUSAN\n</b>\nA CLOSE UP.  She now realizes that there is no point in\nsaying goodbye to him: she has already told him that she is\nleaving and, if she becomes involved in further argument\nwith him, it can do no good.  Yet there is some emotion on\nher face as she takes a last look at her brother; she turns\naway.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nFraming him in foreground at the parapet.  Susan can be seen\nthrough the windows before she disappears to the door.\nHunsecker reacts as he catches sight of a vehicle on Broadway\nbelow...\n\n<b>EXT. BROADWAY\n</b>\nThe squad car comes down Broadway at speed.\n\n<b>EXT. DUFFY'S SQUARE\n</b>\nSidney is walking across the square.  The squad car appears\nin foreground; it pauses hardly at all as Kello slips out of\nit, and starts to move after Sidney.  Then the car\naccelerates round Duffy Square to cut Sidney off on the\nother side.\n\n<b>SIDNEY\n</b>\nSidney comes up towards CAMERA.  Seeing something ahead, he\nhalts...\n\n<b>SQUAD CAR\n</b>\nFrom Sidney's viewpoint.  The car breaks to a stop.  It's\ndoor opens and a detective gets out slowly.  It is Phil.\n\n<b>RESUME SIDNEY\n</b>\nSidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond.\nSidney knows what this means.  He starts to speak before he\nturns to look over his shoulder.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            Hello, Harry...\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nKello, moving silently up behind Sidney, slows down, amused\nat Sidney's prescience.\n\n<b>                         KELLO\n</b>            Hi!\n                   (coming to join Sidney)\n            I just been on the phone to J.J.\n\nKello's manner is almost affectionate.  He shakes his head,\nadmonishing Sidney.\n\n<b>                         KELLO\n</b>                   (mildly)\n            You been a bad boy, Sidney.  J.J.'s\n            going to write about you in his\n            column tomorrow.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nSHOOTING ACROSS Kello onto Sidney.  Sidney's smile is tired.\n\n<b>                         SIDNEY\n</b>            I thought he would.\n\n<b>                         KELLO\n</b>            Yeah...\n                   (then)\n            And another thing - he's gonna say\n            you 'resisted arrest'...\n                   (as Sidney nods)\n            You know J.J....!\n\nSidney turns away to look back towards Phil.  Then, taking\nKello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop\nviciously across the mouth.\n\n<b>KELLO\n</b>\nKello's head jerks back.  Recovering at once, he guffaws,\nlurches into CAMERA with a sudden vicious movement.  There\nis a sharp guttural cry over scene.\n\n<b>LONGER ANGLE\n</b>\nPhil runs forward towards the figures of Sidney and Kello\nseen beyond him.  In doing so, he blocks the view so that we\ndo not clearly see the violence with which Kello strikes\nSidney down.  Phil, in foreground, is seen to relax.  When\nhe moves aside, clearing the view, Sidney is writhing on the\nground at Kello's feet.\n\n<b>CLOSER ANGLE\n</b>\nKello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief.  He signals to\nPhil to help lift the body at his feet.  Phil enters shot\nand they raise Sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out\nof shot.\n\n<b>LONG SHOT\n</b>\nThe cops carry the figure of Sidney Falco across Duffy\nSquare; they bundle him into the police car.  The pigeons in\nthe square, circle.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER'S TERRACE\n</b>\nCAMERA LOOKS down towards Duffy Square in the distance.  The\npolice car can be seen moving off, circling the square and\ndisappearing southward on Broadway.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to\ninclude Hunsecker in foreground.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nA CLOSE SHOT, SHOOTING sharply upward at Hunsecker.  He\nlooks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly\ninsane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he\nturns back, dismissing Sidney from his thoughts.\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nCAMERA SHOOTS towards the closed door of Susan's room.\nHunsecker walks into the shot, stops before the door.  He\nbegins to take off his tie and unbutton his shirt, clearly\npreparing to go to bed.  As an after-thought, he comes back\nto the door, addresses it:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (gently)\n            Susie?\n                   (getting no answer)\n            Are you in bed...?\n\nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER.  It is at a low level, still emphasizing\nthe man's dignity.  He strolls for a few paces.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            I don't have to tell you, of\n            course, that I cleared your\n            boyfriend's name; I didn't let you\n            down...\n\nCAMERA has now moved so that we are shooting past Hunsecker\nonto Susan's door.  He gets no answer except silence.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nA CLOSE SHOT, REVERSE ANGLE.  We now see in his face a\nflicker of fear.  With what is clearly an effort, he\nreassumes a confident manner.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            ...I was saving this news for\n            breakfast, but I think I'll jump\n            the gun!  I'M GONNA GIVE YOU AND\n<b>            DALLAS THE BIGGEST WEDDING THIS\n</b><b>            TOWN HAS EVER SEEN!\n</b>\nStill no answer from inside the bedroom.  Hunsecker's forced\nexpression remains unnaturally fixed upon his face.  He\ncalls out:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>            Susie...?\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM\n</b>\nThe room is quite empty.  CAMERA SHOOTS across the bed\ntowards the door in background.  Susan's discarded fur coat\nlies on the bed.  And the doors of the wardrobe are open.\nHunsecker's voice can be heard continuing over scene:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)\n</b>                   (outside)\n            I'm getting the Mayor to perform\n            the ceremony and - NO, I think I'll\n            fly the Governor down from Albany...\n                   (a pause)\n            Do you hear...?\n\nA pause.  Then, very tentatively, the bedroom door is opened.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)\n</b>                   (outside)\n            Are you listening?...\n\nNow he opens the door and comes in.\n\n<b>HUNSECKER\n</b>\nA BIG CLOSE UP.  The sight of the empty room freezes his\nface for a moment.  His eyes look round.\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM\n</b>\nFrom Hunsecker's viewpoint.  A PANNING SHOT, from the open\ndoor of the cupboard to the fur coat.  CAMERA PULLS BACK to\ninclude Hunsecker.  He steps to the bed, picks up the coat.\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE\n</b>\nThere is a dazed, incredulous look on his face.  But, as he\nglances over his shoulder, CAMERA ZOOMS PAST him towards a\nlittle door in the wall behind him: It is ajar, showing a\ncouple of inches of light.\n\n<b>RESUME HUNSECKER\n</b>\nOnce again Hunsecker reassures himself that Susan must be\nbehind the door.  But his voice is even more false as he\ndeclares:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (a note of anger\n                   appearing in his voice)\n            Susie!...You won't threaten\n            me!...Nobody walks out on J.J.\n            Hunsecker!\nCAMERA NOW MOVES CLOSER and closer to Hunsecker.  The ANGLE\nis a weird one, tilting grotesquely upward.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            You need me - you all need me!...\n\nHunsecker, his fists clenching fiercely at the fur coat,\nwalks towards the door.  CAMERA PANS with him.  He stands a\nfew inches from the narrow opening.  He seems about to push\nthe door open further, but is afraid to do so.\n\n<b>INT. BATHROOM\n</b>\nCAMERA SHOOTS ACROSS the bathtub, showing enough of the tiny\nroom to make it clear that it, too, is completely empty.\nThrough the slit in the door, we can see only a glimpse of\nthe movement of Hunsecker outside.  Hunsecker's voice\ncontinues:\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER (O.S.)\n</b>            \"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall\n            not want\".\n                   (a sneering laugh)\n            That's bunk in a book!  I'm the\n            Shepherd of millions of little men\n            and women!...\n\n<b>INT. BEDROOM\n</b>\nA DOWNWARD ANGLE, SHOOTING past Hunsecker to the door.  As\nHunsecker retreats from the door, he is still clutching the\nfur coat.  He stands alone in the middle of the room and his\ngestures are a little wild.  CAMERA rises higher to shoot\ndown at Hunsecker, alone in the little room.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            ...I don't ask them to get on their\n            knees, but they come to me for\n            advice and guidance!  Who are you\n            to reject me!\n\nWith an increasingly eccentric manner, Hunsecker strides out\nof the bedroom door into the living room again.\n\n<b>INT. LIVING ROOM\n</b>\nA similar ANGLE, SHOOTING down on Hunsecker as he comes out\nof the bedroom.  But as he starts to roam the vast room,\nCAMERA rises higher still, pulling backwards and upwards to\na LONG SHOT which holds the entirety of the big room in all\nits ugliness.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            What makes YOU fit to sit in\n            judgment on a man like me.  Only a\n            great person understands another\n            great person, and that leaves you\n            out!\n\nHunsecker is now addressing the whole of the apartment, no\nlonger pretending even to himself, that the girl is still\nlistening.  He moves off towards the windows to the terrace\nwhere the curtains are now blowing in the morning wind.  He\ngoes out towards the terrace, his voice becoming more\ndistant - a man shouting empty nonsense, addressing no one.\n\n<b>                         HUNSECKER\n</b>                   (continuing)\n            - That leaves you ALL out!  You're\n            pigmies!  You're all sick, weak\n            midgets!  I'm proud to be alone!...\n\n<b>EXT. BROADWAY\n</b>\nCAMERA SHOOTS STEEPLY UP towards the top of the Brill Bldg.\n(At this angle Hunsecker's terrace will not be visible but\nits position is established in relationship to the Budweiser\nsign.) CAMERA PANS DOWN to pick up the figure of Susan\nHunsecker as she pushes her way out of the brass doors onto\nBroadway.\n\n<b>CLOSER ANGLE\n</b>\nSusan pauses on the sidewalk.  She stays there for a moment.\nShe breathes in the fresh morning air, looking around with\nthe expression of someone who sees the world with new eyes.\nThen she starts up Broadway - away from the Times Square\narea.  The girl's step has a purpose in it; she has\nconfidence and courage.  Music for the end titles is quiet,\nsimple and lyrical.\n\n<b>                       END OF PICTURE\n</b>\n<b> \n</b></pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Sweet Smell of Success</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ernest Lehman\" title=\"Scripts by Ernest Lehman\">Ernest Lehman</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Clifford Odets\" title=\"Scripts by Clifford Odets\">Clifford Odets</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Film-Noir\" title=\"Film-Noir Scripts\">Film-Noir</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Sweet Smell of Success Script.html#comments\" title=\"Sweet Smell of Success comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:17:45.157241"}
