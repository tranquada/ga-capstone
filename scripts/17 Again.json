No, Stan's more\n                    complex than that. According to\n                    leading psychiatrists Stan is a\n                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under\n                    all that male bravado there's an\n                    insecure little girl banging on the\n                    closet door trying to get out. 2,\n                    like a caveman, Stan's brain is\n                    underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is\n                    unable to use self-control so he\n                    acts out aggressively.
