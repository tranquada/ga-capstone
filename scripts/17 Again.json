No, Stan's more\n                    complex than that. According to\n                    leading psychiatrists Stan is a\n                    bully for 1 of 3 reasons. 1, under\n                    all that male bravado there's an\n                    insecure little girl banging on the\n                    closet door trying to get out. 2,\n                    like a caveman, Stan's brain is\n                    underdeveloped. Therefore Stan is\n                    unable to use self-control so he\n                    acts out aggressively. And the\n                    third reason-\n<b>          \n</b>          Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              MIKE (CONT'D)\n</b>                    I'd argue that Stan suffers from\n                    all 3.\n<b>          \n</b>          The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY.\n<b>          \n</b>          Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan, who recoils, then\n          gently rolls the ball back to Stan.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                              MIKE (CONT'D)\n</b><b>                        (WINKS)\n</b>                    Don't hurt yourself big boy.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                    42.\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b>          Some students, including Alex, ERUPT.
