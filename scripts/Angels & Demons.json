A sign says the place is under\n          construction.\n          \n          At a side door,\n          \n          Olivetti races alongside the church, followed by the others.\n          He reaches a door with a large, heavy ring, and pulls it toward\n          him. But the door won t budge.    He pushes, throws his shoulder\n          into it.

As they disappear around the back of the church,\n          Langdon steps up to the large ring, gives it an almighty twist --\n          \n          INT       SANTA MARIA DEL POPOLO            DUSK\n          \n          -- and the heavy door CLUNKS open.\n          \n          The interior of the church is an obstacle course of torn-up\n          flooring, brick pallets, mounds of dirt.    Silt drifts in the\n          dying sunlight that shines through the broken windows and walls.\n          \n          Nothing moves.    Dead silence.    Langdon and Vittoria walk\n          slowly to the middle of the floor, at one end of the chapel.\n          There are eight recesses, four on either side of a central aisle,\n          all covered with large sheets of plastic, to protect them during\n          construction.\n          \n                                         46.\n          \n          \n          \n                                          LANGDON\n                                 (WHISPERING)\n                            The chapel is in one of those apses.\n          \n          The plastic RUSTLES ominously.

Langdon notices, it makes him uncomfortable.\n          \n                                          LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            You have to give that back.\n          \n          She looks at him --- what are you, nuts? Something rushes at them\n          from the side, she whirls --\n          \n          --- and nearly blows Olivetti to kingdom come as he and Vincenzo\n          barrel in through the side door.\n          \n          Langdon gestures --- everybody quiet. Olivetti points to the left\n          gestures to Langdon and Vittoria to go to the right.\n          \n          They separate, to either side of the main aisle.\n          \n          AT THE FIRST CHAPEL,\n          \n          Langdon pulls the plastic aside, eyes scan the chapel.      Nothing.\n          ON THE OTHER SIDE,\n          \n          Olivetti does the same, at another chapel.      Nothing.\n          \n          AT THE THIRD CHAPEL,\n          \n          Vittoria pushes the plastic aside, gun in front of her.      There's\n          a sudden movement to her left, she whirls --\n          \n          --- and a rat scurries away.\n          \n          AT THE FOURTH CHAPEL,\n          \n          Langdon pushes the plastic aside, steps inside --\n          \n          -- and GASPS.\n          \n          Moving behind him, we see a Christian chapel like no other we've\n          ever seen.    Finished entirely in chestnut marble, overhead it\n          has a domed cupola with a field of illuminated stars and the seven\n          planets (as known in Galileo's day).\n          \n          Further down the wall, there are tributes to earth's four seasons\n          but most incredible of all are the two huge structures that\n          dominate the room from either side.\n          \n                                          47.\n          \n          \n          \n          Pyramids.

There is a large oval\n          medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it.    It's slightly\n          off center, raised.    As if it's been opened recently, and\n          hurriedly replaced.\n          \n                                          LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            The demon's hole.\n          \n          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,\n          \n          we're looking up now as the medallion GRINDS to the side.     Faces\n          peer down at us -- Langdon, Vittoria, Olivetti, and Vincenzo. They\n          recoil from a stench.\n          \n          UP TOP,\n          \n          Langdon squints, trying to see inside.\n          \n                                          LANGDON\n                            Anybody got a flashlight?\n          \n          Vincenzo hands him one.

Takes a deep breath, looks at the others.\n          \n                                                LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            Those guns.

It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh-\n          colored, but still indistinct.    He takes a step toward it --\n          \n          -- and something CRUNCHES under his feet.\n          \n          He shines the light down.    He's standing on a pile of human skulls\n          \n                                          OLIVETTI\n                                 (calling down)\n                            You okay?\n          \n                                             LANGDON\n                            More or less.\n          \n          He takes two more steps, closer to the swaying figure on the other\n          side of the crypt.    He can now clearly see a man's naked back.\n          \n                                          LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            He's here!

As Langdon draws close, he sees the source\n          of the movement --- rats, gnawing at the dead body.\n          \n          They scurry away as Langdon comes around the front, and we pull\n          back to see what he sees.\n          \n          It's Cardinal Lamasse.\n          \n          He's been buried in the earthen floor of the crypt up to his waist\n          his jaw broken, his mouth crammed full of dirt.\n          \n          But that's not the worst of it.    Langdon GAGS as he sees the\n          blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the\n          Cardinal's chest.    It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but\n          this time it says --\n          \n                                         EARTH.\n          \n                                                                      CUT TO:\n          \n          \n          \n          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL      DAY\n          \n          Cardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of\n          the Sistine Chapel as the electors, one by one, cast their votes\n          in the traditional manner.\n          \n                                        49.\n          \n          \n          \n          An AFRICAN CARDINAL at the front of the line kneels before him.\n          \n                                          AFRICAN CARDINAL\n                                 (SUBTITLED)\n                            I call as my witness Christ the Lord,\n                            who will be my judge that my vote is\n                            given to the one who before God I\n                            think should be elected.\n          \n          The African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t\n          lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large\n          chalice.\n          \n          He places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and\n          uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice.

They're shaking.\n          \n          He's standing in a lavish marble bathroom, now cleaned up and\n          changed into black pants and a black long-sleeved shirt.    No\n          Roman collar, they don't just give you those, but clearly the\n          clothes of a priest.

He holds\n          his eyes closed for a moment, opens them, it's not much better.\n          \n          Langdon looks at the glass wall on the far side of the vault. Then\n          at the row of bookcases.    Gets an idea.\n          \n          He goes to the last bookcase, which is about six feet from the\n          glass wall. He hoists himself up on the shelf of the bookcase\n          opposite it, wedges himself in.\n          \n          And pushes with one leg.      The giant bookcase teeters, but just\n          barely.\n          \n          Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the\n          bookshelf.\n          \n          Pushes again -- more movement this time.\n          \n          Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The\n          bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return,\n          starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall,\n          which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --\n          \n          --- stops.\n          \n          Leaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a\n          scratch.\n          \n          Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea.\n          \n          He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees\n          Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious.\n          \n          But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries\n          in a shoulder holster.\n          \n          LANGDON'S HAND\n          \n          slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it.     Safe bet he's\n          never held one of these before.\n          \n          He staggers over toward the glass wall, raises the gun, and pulls\n          the trigger.    Nothing happens.    Trigger doesn't even move.\n          \n                                       70.\n          \n          \n          \n          After a moment of oxygen-poor thinking, he figures out how to\n          CLICK off the safety.    Tries again.\n          \n          (Pow.)\n          \n          The sound of the shot is barely audible to Langdon.     His brain's\n          going fast.\n          \n          If he was hoping to bring the whole wall down, he failed, but\n          there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he\n          goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside.\n          \n          He stands back, his brain clearing momentarily.\n          \n          Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners,\n          and at the tiny web of cracks radiating out from the hole he just\n          made in the center.\n          \n          He raises the gun again and fires off FOUR SHOTS in quick\n          succession.    They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper\n          right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower\n          right corner.\n          \n          Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first\n          hole, in the center.\n          \n          Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to\n          the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a\n          chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first\n          hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall ---\n          \n           -- and presses gently.\n          \n          Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his\n          hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up\n          to connect with the hole in the upper left corner.\n          \n          He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts,\n          shooting down to the lower right.

And they're not at all sure they're up for\n          it.\n          \n          AT THE LATE POPE'S SARCOPHAGUS,\n          \n          the Camerlengo closes the last few feet alone.

He rolls out the other side\n          of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and\n          takes off running.\n          \n          Mr. Gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to DOUBLE TAP two\n          shots into the head of a dying Vatican Cop.\n          \n          ACROSS THE CHURCH,\n          \n          Langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the\n          far side of the church.    Bullets SHATTER the glass of an\n          elevated crypt, three feet off the floor.    (Inside is a superbly\n          detailed wax statue of a saint in death.)\n          \n          Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at\n          Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the\n          church.\n          \n          Langdon's back THUDS into a wall.\n          \n          Dead end.\n          \n          But there's an old wooden grating in the wall.   He turns, KICKS\n          it with both feet.\n          \n          The grating CRUNCHES into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace\n          \n          IN THE CRAWL SPACE,\n          \n          Langdon army-crawls through it.\n          \n          Mr. Gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt.    He pauses to\n          change clips on his handgun --\n          \n          -- the floor beneath Langdon abruptly runs out   --\n          \n          -- Mr. Gray raises his gun     --\n          \n           -- and Langdon disappears. The gunshots THUD into cement wall\n          where he was, not where he is.\n          \n                                         83.\n          \n          \n          \n          UNDERGROUND,\n          \n          Langdon CRUNCHES to a hard landing on a subterranean stone floor,\n          rolls over, and sees Mr. Gray above him, now pointing down.\n          \n          But there's another crawl space, and Langdon scurries into it.\n          \n          IN THE SECOND CRAWL SPACE,\n          \n          it's hopelessly dark, an even tighter space than the last one,\n          filled with cobwebs that Langdon blindly claws his way through.\n          \n          He hits another hole in the floor, falls a second time ---\n          \n          INTO THE CATACOMB,\n          \n           -- and lands on top of a pile of long-decayed skeletons in the\n          nearly-black bottom of the church's underground warren of hiding\n          places.\n          \n          He looks up.    He's ten feet from the nearest handhold, only a\n          fool would follow him down here\n          \n          BACK UP IN THE BURNING CHURCH,\n          \n           -- and Mr. Gray is no fool.      He steps back over the balustrade\n          and leaves the chapel.\n          \n          The waxen face of the carving in the sarcophagus melts in the\n          intense heat of the out-of-control fire.\n          \n                                                                       CUT TO:\n          \n          INT      SISTINE CHAPEL - SALON        NIGHT\n          \n          In the salon outside the Sistine Chapel, the Camerlengo waits\n          alone.    From inside can be heard the sound of VOICES in debate.\n          \n          Finally, the big doors open and Cardinal Mortati emerges, goes to\n          him.\n          \n                                          MORTATI\n                            My son...

Its central core is twenty feet\n          tall, a rugged mountain of marble with caves and grottoes through\n          which water churns.

When he looks back up --\n          \n          -- there is a silenced pistol pointing directly at him.\n          \n          PHOOM.\n          \n          He takes a bullet in the forehead, slumps forward against the\n          window, and --\n          \n          FROM A DISTANCE,\n          \n          we see his body pulled rapidly into the van through the driver's\n          window.    Whole thing took about three seconds.    DINERS at an\n          outdoor cafe don't even notice.\n          \n          FROM LANGDON'S POINT OF VIEW,\n          \n          on the other side of the fountain, the van rocks slightly, but he\n          can't see anything out of the ordinary.\n          \n          He turns, looks to the Second Cop, who is just now approaching\n          from the rear of the van.\n          \n          WITH THE SECOND COP,\n          \n          this one's got his gun in front of him, he's ready for anything.\n          We creep around the back of the van with him, and just as he comes\n          around to where he can see the driver's side --\n          \n           -- the barrel of the silencer presses into his forehead.

All he knows is the two cops aren't coming out from the\n          other side of the van, something is going on --\n          \n                                        95.\n          \n          \n          \n          -- and the bell in the clock tower starts to BONG.\n          \n          EVEN UNARMED,   LANGDON STARTS TO MOVE FORWARD,   JUST AS   --\n          \n          -- the sliding door on the fountain side of the van SLAMS open\n          \n           -- revealing the figure of the FOURTH CARDINAL, wrapped in chains\n          and with manacled hands and feet.    He thrashes against the iron\n          links, but the chains are too heavy.    One of the links bisects\n          his mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help.    Mr.\n          Gray hovers over him.\n          \n          Langdon GASPS   --\n          \n          -- and Mr. Gray shoves the bound figure roughly out of the van.\n          \n          The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous\n          SPLASH.    His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom.\n          \n          There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes\n          with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock\n          tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear.\n          \n          Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then\n          back up at Mr. Gray--\n          \n          -- who salutes him ---\n          \n          -- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there.\n          \n          Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police\n          car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but\n          then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal\n          must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all.\n          \n          Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides\n          and leaps in.\n          \n          IN THE FOUNTAIN,\n          \n          the water is waist deep and like ice.    Steady streams of bubbles\n          rise up from the bottom, churning it.\n          \n          Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in   --\n          \n          UNDERWATER,\n          \n          -- and struggles to get both arms underneath the drowning man.\n          \n          Through the watery haze, we can see the man's bare chest, branded\n          with the final ambigram:\n          \n                                         WATER.\n          \n                                       96.\n          \n          \n          \n          Langdon struggles to lift him, but the weight is too much, he can\n          barely get him a few inches off the bottom of the fountain, much\n          less all the way to the surface.\n          \n          Langdon, running out of air, bursts to the surface and   -- ON THE\n          SURFACE,\n          \n          -- takes a deep breath, then plunges back   --\n          \n          UNDERWATER,\n          \n          -- but he still can't move the Cardinal.\n          \n          He makes eye contact with the dying man, who seems to be accepting\n          his fate, maybe even welcoming it.\n          \n          Langdon changes his grip, strains like hell, and actually gets him\n          a few inches higher this time, but nowhere close to the air\n          supply.\n          \n          But with the new position, his eyes fall on something behind the\n          cardinal -- a plastic tube, six inches across, streaming bubbles\n          into the fountain.\n          \n          He goes back   --\n          \n          ABOVE THE SURFACE\n          \n           -- takes another breathy and sees the fountain of bubbles rising\n          up to the surface just above the tube.    Air!\n          \n          Several PASSERS-BY notice the commotion in the fountain as Langdon\n          dives back under the water.\n          \n          UNDERWATER,\n          \n          Langdon drags the body of the Cardinal a few feet across the\n          bottom of the fountain and RIPS the tube free from its mooring,\n          pulling it to the Cardinal's mouth.\n          \n          He clamps it down over the man's lips, and the Cardinal sucks a\n          few greedy breaths from it.    Enough to keep him alive.\n          \n          Langdon takes the tube and draws a couple breaths of his own, then\n          digs his hands back underneath the Cardinal to lift him, but this\n          time --\n          \n          -- SIX MORE HANDS come in from all sides.\n          \n          Several Passers-by have jumped into the fountain to help, and as\n          they all strain together --\n          \n                                         97.\n          \n          \n          \n          ON THE SURFACE,\n          \n           -- the Cardinal's bound body breaks the surface and he GULPS deep\n          lungfuls of air.\n          \n          He is saved.    Langdon sags against the side of the fountain,\n          exhausted and freezing, as the others pull the Cardinal's body to\n          safety.\n          \n          In the distance, SIRENS.\n          \n          Langdon, gathering himself, goes to the Cardinal, speaks in rapid\n          Spanish, subtitled.\n          \n                                          LANGDON\n                            Cardinale Guidera?\n          \n                                               CARDINAL GU\n                            Si...si...\n          \n                                          LANGDON\n                            The Church of Illumination.

Half\n          the flashlight's beam falls on the side wall, and the other half --\n          \n          INT     SECRET PASSAGE         NIGHT\n          \n          -- shines through into the secret passage behind the wall.\n          \n          Langdon draws in his breath and forces himself through the tiny\n          slit, just wide enough for a determined person to squeeze through.\n          \n          Vittoria follows.\n          \n          They look ahead, shining the light.

Several of the larger cells are\n          intact, and on the floor of one they see black robes and red\n          sashes.\n          \n          They approach an iron doorway in the wall. The door is ajar and\n          beyond it there is some sort of passage.

Or from it.\n                           An ancient escape route.\n          \n          They round a corner, where the tunnel takes a ninety degree turn\n          to the right.    At the corner, Langdon notices another\n          pentagrammal block in the floor.\n          \n          He bends, studies the direction it's pointing,         feels the wall    --\n          \n                                         LANGDON         (cont'd)\n                           Another overlap.\n          \n           -- and finds another overlapping angle, this one even smaller\n          than the last.    The wall is actually joined at the floor, seems\n          to open out at the middle (in roughly the shape of a human form\n          turned sideways), and joins again at the top.\n          \n          HE TAKES A DEEP BREATH,   SLIPS THROUGH THE GAP        --\n          \n          -- and finds himself at the base of a set of steep spiral stairs.\n          \n          Langdon looks up, to the top of the stairs.

If he was\n                            worried about seizures, he must have\n                            asked Rocher to install a camera\n                            without telling anyone.

Langdon touches it.\n          \n          ON THE MONITOR,\n          \n          the image ZIPS backwards, rapidly, to the shooting, and the all\n          the way back to when Rocher and the Camerlengo were alone\n          together.
