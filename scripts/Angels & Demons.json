In a Catholic church.\n                            This is it.\n<b>          \n</b>          Behind them, the plastic rustles, as if drawn by a wind, and as\n          Langdon turns, he hears, faintly, a DOOR CLOSING far away.\n<b>          \n</b>          He turns back, eyes drawn to the floor.    There is a large oval\n          medallion there, with a skeleton carved into it.    It's slightly\n          off center, raised.    As if it's been opened recently, and\n          hurriedly replaced.\n<b>          \n</b>                                          LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            The demon's hole.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          IN THE DEMON'S HOLE,\n</b><b>          \n</b>          we're looking up now as the medallion GRINDS to the side.

It's brighter here, he can see it's flesh-\n          colored, but still indistinct.    He takes a step toward it --\n<b>          \n</b>          -- and something CRUNCHES under his feet.\n<b>          \n</b>          He shines the light down.

He can now clearly see a man's naked back.\n<b>          \n</b>                                          LANGDON (cont'd)\n                            He's here!

Langdon GAGS as he sees the\n          blackened word that has been branded into the red flesh of the\n          Cardinal's chest.    It's an ambigram, like we've seen before, but\n          this time it says --\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                         EARTH.\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                                                                      CUT TO:\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          INT     SISTINE CHAPEL      DAY\n</b><b>          \n</b>          Cardinal Mortati sits regally at the main altar at the front of\n          the Sistine Chapel as the electors, one by one, cast their votes\n          in the traditional manner.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                        49.\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b>          An AFRICAN CARDINAL at the front of the line kneels before him.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                          AFRICAN CARDINAL\n</b><b>                                 (SUBTITLED)\n</b>                            I call as my witness Christ the Lord,\n                            who will be my judge that my vote is\n                            given to the one who before God I\n                            think should be elected.\n<b>          \n</b>          The African Cardinal stands, holds his ballot over his head, t\n          lowers the ballot to the altar, where a plate sits atop a large\n          chalice.\n<b>          \n</b>          He places the ballot on the plate, then picks up the plate and\n          uses it to drop the ballot in the chalice.

The giant bookcase teeters, but just\n          barely.\n<b>          \n</b>          Langdon hoists himself further up, gets both legs up against the\n          bookshelf.\n<b>          \n</b>          Pushes again -- more movement this time.\n<b>          \n</b>          Now he puts everything he has into it, straining like hell.    The\n          bookcase starts to tip, goes just past the point of no return,\n          starts to fall, gloriously headed straight for the glass wall,\n          which it SLAMS into with enormous power and --\n<b>          \n</b>          --- stops.\n<b>          \n</b>          Leaning against the wall.     Forget cracks, there's not even a\n          scratch.\n<b>          \n</b>          Langdon CURSES under his breath, looks around for another idea.\n<b>          \n</b>          He hears a soft THUD from the other side of the room, sees\n          Chartrand has slumped over, unconscious.\n<b>          \n</b>          But his jacket has fallen open, revealing the sidearm he carries\n          in a shoulder holster.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          LANGDON'S HAND\n</b><b>          \n</b>          slips the gun out of the holster and hefts it.

They're in an odd pattern-- upper left corner, upper\n          right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower\n          right corner.\n<b>          \n</b>          Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first\n          hole, in the center.\n<b>          \n</b>          Shaking his head once more to clear it, Langdon steps forward to\n          the glass wall, but instead of barreling against it or throwing a\n          chair, he simply raises one hand, places it flat over the first\n          hole he made, the one in the center of the glass wall ---\n<b>          \n</b>           -- and presses gently.\n<b>          \n</b>          Almost immediately, a SHARP SOUND comes from the hole beneath his\n          hand and a jagged crack leaps out from the first hole, shooting up\n          to connect with the hole in the upper left corner.\n<b>          \n</b>          He presses just a touch harder and a SECOND CRACK starts,\n          shooting down to the lower right.    Then a third, and a fourth,\n          the glass is cracking like ice in springtime, all four extremities\n          connecting with the central hole, and with a huge GROANING SOUND -\n<b>          -\n</b><b>          \n</b>          -- the entire glass wall falls to pieces at his feet.\n<b>          \n</b>          Air RUSHES into the vault.\n<b>          \n</b>          And, wouldn't you know it, the power comes back on in the Archives.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                                                      CUT TO:\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>                                       71.\n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          \n</b><b>          INT     VATICAN GROTTOES      NIGHT\n</b><b>          \n</b>          Vittoria, the Camerlengo, and the two Swiss Guard reach the\n          entrance to the Holy Vatican Grottoes just as --\n<b>          \n</b>          -- their power goes out.\n<b>          \n</b>          Two flashlights CLICK on, and the Guardsmen lead the way in.
