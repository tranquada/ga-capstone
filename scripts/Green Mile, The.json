The bread\n              lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading\n              west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in\n              their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their\n              bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding\n              the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on\n              the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as\n              \"Hooverville\" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's\n              capitol...\n\n              All these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so\n              very long ago...\n\n              EXT.

GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY)\n\n              A CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly\n              pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain. PAUL\n              EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day...\n\n              INT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING\n\n              Paul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning\n              his shirt. He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair...\n\n              INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING\n\n              THE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts. A WOMAN\n              inches along on a walker. A MAN shuffles by with a rolling\n              I.V. stand. The floor is a limey, institutional green.\n\n              Paul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional\n              greeting.\n\n              INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING\n\n              DOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee\n              or tea. Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their\n              own company, some just stare slackly into space.\n\n              Paul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other\n              ladies, sipping tea. She's 80, refined and elegant, his best\n              friend here. She gives him a good-morning smile. He gives her\n              a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more.\n\n              Paul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two\n              pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. He tosses\n              Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits.\n\n              INT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING\n\n              Paul slips to the back door unnoticed. Identical red plastic\n              rain ponchos line the wall on pegs. He helps himself to one\n              and eases outside, making good his escape.\n\n              EXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING\n\n              Nestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling\n              over the treetops.\n\n              Paul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed\n              poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply--\n              this is a man who loves his walks.\n\n              He pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to\n              nibble as he presses up on the ridge...\n\n              Low angle: nursing home and ridge beyond\n\n              ...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up\n              toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and\n              parks, a bumper sticker looming large: \"I Have Seen God and\n              His Name Is Newt Gingrich\".\n\n              BRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's,\n              arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes\n              up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly:\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        Old fuck.\n\n              He slams the door and heads for the nursing home...\n\n              EXT. WOODS - MORNING\n\n              ...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul\n              wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking\n              for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho.\n\n              It's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are\n              the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the\n              woodpecker.\n\n              A RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes\n              transfixed. Softly:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Oh, my...\n\n              Reverse angle\n\n              reveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty\n              breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other\n              for an endless moment, both standing stock still...\n\n              ...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the\n              foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder.\n              He takes another bite of toast, moves on...\n\n              ...and WE PAN WITH HIM to reveal a pair of old wooden storage\n              shacks along the path up ahead.\n\n              INT. SHACK - MORNING\n\n              Dark in here, cobwebby and decrepit. We see Paul approaching\n              outside the grimy window. He steps up to the glass and shades\n              his eyes, peering curiously in as we\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n              EXT. NURSING HOME - DAY\n\n              Paul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. He\n              reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from\n              behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. He whirls, gasping in\n              fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        Out for a little stroll, Paulie?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Let go...\n\n              Paul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        What's with this poncho you got\n                        on, huh? This isn't yours.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I got it off the wall there.\n                        There's a whole row of them.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        But not for you, Paulie, that's\n                        the thing. Those are for the staff.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I just borrowed it. Don't see what\n                        harm it does.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        It's not about harm, it's about\n                        rules. You probably don't think an\n                        old fart like you has to mind\n                        rules anymore, but that's just not\n                        true.\n\n              Brad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing\n              the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I'm sorry if I broke the rules.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        You got no business up in those\n                        woods anyway, especially in the\n                        rain. What if you fall and bust a\n                        hip, huh? Who you think's gonna\n                        have to hoss your sorry old bacon\n                        back down here? Me, that's who.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        You're hurting me!\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        What do you do up there, anyway?\n                        You're too old to go jerk off, so\n                        what do you do?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Nothing. I just walk, that's all,\n                        I like to walk!\n\n              Brad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been\n              holding tightly clenched shut.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see.\n\n              Paul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of\n              a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear.\n\n                                  ELAINE (O.S.)\n                        Paul?\n\n              They turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a\n              cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much\n              she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing:\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        I saw you coming back, thought\n                        you'd like some tea.\n                               (beat)\n                        Are you coming in?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting.\n                        About the weather. I think we're\n                        through now.\n\n              Brad lets Paul loose, leans close:\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed\n                        your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em\n                        you're having senile delusions.\n                        Who you think they'll believe?\n\n              Brad walks off. Paul turns, watches him go. The screen door\n              opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale. Paul gives her a\n              strained, though grateful, smile as we\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT. TV ROOM - DAY\n\n              Jerry Springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience\n              into a frenzy. PAN OFF TO REVEAL DOZENS OF OLD FOLKS watching\n              on couches and folding chairs. An old black fellow named PETE\n              is grousing to a GROUP OF ELDERLY LADIES...\n\n                                  PETE\n                        Why we always watch this crap?\n\n                                  ELDERLY LADY #1\n                        It's interesting.\n\n                                  PETE\n                        Interesting?

He's\n                        just an abusive bully, and should\n                        be made to stop.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Ellie, please...\n\n              Pete\n\n              is at the TV, switching channels while:\n\n                                  ELDERLY LADIES\n                        ...no, the Movie Classic channel\n                        is further down...past the Home\n                        Shopping...keep going...\n\n              He finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old\n              black and white musical--\"Top Hat,\" with Fred Astaire and\n              Ginger Rogers. A delighted reaction:\n\n                                  ELDERLY LADY #2\n                        Oh! This is wonderful...\n\n              Paul\n\n              idly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes\n              slack with recognition and dismay. Elaine sees the look in\n              his eyes.\n\n              He glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in\n              the end, he can't help himself. The past just caught up with\n              him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to\n              ride the rails...\n\n              He looks back at the TV. On screen, Fred and Ginger have\n              begun their famous \"Cheek to Cheek\" number, with Astaire\n              singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his:\n\n                                  FRED ASTAIRE\n                        Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my\n                        heart beat so that I can hardly\n                        speak...\n\n              SLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching. He'd like to take his eyes\n              off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than\n              Brad Dolan's. Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern:\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Paul? What is it?\n\n              No response. All he can hear is that music, all he can see\n              are those dancers. The figures on TV are gliding with\n              ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long\n              ago...\n\n              Paul abruptly bursts into tears.\n\n              The room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. All\n              eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. Paul just\n              sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Paul...my God...\n\n                                  ORDERLY\n                               (rushing over)\n                        What is it?

He puts his hand on\n              Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern.\n\n                                  BRAD\n                        S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo-\n                        hoo? Something nasty happen?\n\n              Elaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly\n                        fine without your help, thank you.\n\n              Brad back off with a \"hey, suit yourself\" gesture. Elaine\n              helps Paul to his feet and leads him out.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT. SUN ROOM - DAY\n\n              Paul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained. It's\n              raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond. Elaine\n              waits across from him, wishing he would speak. Softly:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I guess sometimes the past just\n                        catches up with you, whether you\n                        want it to or not. It's silly.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Was it the film?\n                               (off his look)\n                        It was, wasn't it?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I haven't spoken of these things\n                        in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty\n                        years.\n\n              She reaches out, gently takes his hand.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Paul.

Yes you are.\n\n              Paul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all\n              this time...and decides that perhaps he is:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I ever tell you I was a prison\n                        guard during the depression?\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        You've mentioned it.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Did I mention I was in charge of\n                        death row? That I supervised all\n                        the executions?\n\n              This does come as a surprise. She shakes her head.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        They usually call death row the\n                        Last Mile, but we called ours the\n                        Green Mile, because the floor was\n                        the color of faded limes.

GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky.\n\n              A late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along\n              the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. It\n              seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension.\n\n              EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY\n\n              A Depression-era prison in the south.

His face is\n              pained, his forehead beaded with sweat.\n\n              INT. E BLOCK (THE GREEN MILE) - DAY\n\n              BRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed \"Brutal\" for his intimidating size,\n              but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the\n              entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing\n              slot. He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate.\n\n              He turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the\n              duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of\n              faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom,\n              with four large cells to a side.\n\n              Brutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Paul?

He finally hears\n              a THIN TRICKLE, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You all right in there?\n\n                                  PAUL (O.S.)\n                        For a man pissing razor blades.\n\n              The door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You should'a took the day off,\n                        gone to see the doctor.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        With a new arrival?

I think it's clearing\n                        up.\n\n              They hear the truck HONKING as it rumbles up outside. Paul\n              gives them a nod to resume their positions. Paul walks down\n              the Mile, passing the cells where two inmates reside--the\n              first is ARLEN BITTERBUCK, a Washita Cherokee; the second is\n              EDUARD DELACROIX(\"DEL\"), a skinny Cajun.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        New boy coming in, boss?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Never you mind, Del, you just keep\n                        your nose quietly on your business.\n\n              Paul arrives at the end of the Mile, takes up a position at\n              an empty cell. (Down at this end, past the cells, is E\n              Block's version of the \"hole\" -- a padded room where violent\n              inmates are sent to cool off. It isn't used very often...in\n              fact, at the moment, it's doubling as storage space.)\n\n              Brutal\n\n              peers out the viewing slot as the truck stops outside.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Damn, they're riding on the axle.\n                        What'd they do, bust the springs?\n\n              GUARDS PERCY WETMORE AND HARRY TERWILLIGER OF E BLOCK emerge\n              from the back of the truck and step down, turn back...\n\n              Tighter angle on back of truck\n\n              We get our first glimpse of the new inmate as a pair of\n              GIGANTIC BLACK FEET step down into the yard...and the rear of\n              the truck bounces back up on its springs where it belongs.\n\n              Brutal\n\n              sees what's coming, eyes widening slightly.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Paul?

He swings the door open\n              in a hot flood of daylight, giving us our first good look at:\n\n              John coffey\n\n              is a huge black man, nearly 7 feet tall and 300 pounds, his\n              massive head shiny and bald, his skin a tapestry of old\n              scars, his prison overalls (the biggest size they had) ending\n              at mid-calf. He looks dull and confused, as if wondering\n              where he is and how he got there. Percy and Harry lead him\n              toward E Block in shackles. Percy's got his hickory baton out\n              of it custom-made holster, hollering:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Dead man walking!

Everything hangs suspended for a moment, a look of\n              \"hold shit\" written on everybody's faces. Percy keeps yanking\n              on the big man's cuffs, leading him along with a cry of:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Dead man walking!

Paul doesn't dignify it,\n              just motions for them to come on. The procession comes down\n              the Mile, with Brutal and Dean bringing up rear.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You sure you wanna be in there\n                        with him?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                               (looks to Coffey)\n                        Am I gonna have trouble with you,\n                        big boy?\n\n              Coffey shakes his head slowly. Paul takes the clipboard\n              transfer papers from Harry, turns and enters the cell.\n\n              Coffey just stands outside the cell and waits, as if he\n              doesn't understand the concept. Paul motions him to come on\n              in. Coffey starts to comply, but Percy raps him smartly with\n              the tip of his hickory baton to get him moving faster.\n\n              Coffey flinches, enters the cell. Paul stares angrily at\n              Percy, who stands slapping his hickory baton against the palm\n              of his hand like a man with a toy he's itching to use.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Percy.

He looks\n              like he's about to say something, but thinks better of it and\n              stalks angrily up the Mile instead...\n\n              ...and sees Del at his bars, smiling.

It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles\n              uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Because I get a little scared in\n                        the dark sometimes. If it's a\n                        strange place.\n\n              Paul looks to his men.

Then he surprises everybody by\n              offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul\n              hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by\n              accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently,\n              lets go.\n\n              Paul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks\n              it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then\n              sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees.\n              He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to\n                        take it back, but it was too late.\n\n              Paul turns, leads his men up the Mile...\n\n              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE\n\n              ...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but\n              keeping a lid on his temper:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Dean, run Delacroix up to the\n                        infirmary and see if his fingers\n                        are broken.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Course they're broken, I heard the\n                        damn bones crack.

Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN\n              HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever\n              heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.\n\n              PAUL ON BLEACHERS\n\n              ...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Jesus.\n\n              EXT.

He's making that inhuman\n              howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing\n              occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air.\n\n              Curled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of\n              Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now\n              matted to their heads with blood.\n\n              A tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train\n              puffing smoke across the landscape.\n\n              Klaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank\n              in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs\n              them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of\n              inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey\n              barely seems to notice.\n\n              The others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his\n              knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to\n              him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each\n              other tightly, overwhelmed with grief.\n\n              A semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's\n              heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around\n              him, though he hardly seems aware of it.

The mouse\n              stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly\n              around its paws as if to wait. The guards fall silent,\n              fascinated. Bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch.\n\n              Brutal tears off a piece of his half-eaten corned beef\n              sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers.

In\n                        the interests of science, like.\n\n              Paul shrugs. Brutal drops the scrap. The mouse grabs it and\n              eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick.\n\n              The mouse turns and scurries back down the Mile, vanishing\n              under the restraint room door at the far end. Dean throws\n              Paul an \"I told you so\" look.\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        He's in the damn restraint room.\n                        You know he's gonna be chewing the\n                        padding out of walls and making\n                        himself a nice little nest.\n\n              Brutal give Paul a sheepish look--well? Paul sighs.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        All right. Let's get the damn\n                        mouse.\n\n              They stride grimly down the Mile to the restraint room door,\n              men on a mission. Coffey's awake now, peering from his cot.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Saw me a mouse go by.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It was a dream.

Brutal shrugs off his jacket. Paul\n              grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to Dean.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Dean, watch the door.

Paul and Brutal catch their breath, scanning\n              the empty restraint room.

Percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and\n              combing his hair...\n\n              ...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the\n              mouse.

His head swivels slowly...\n\n              ...and there's the mouse. Staring at him.\n\n              That moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time\n              itself.

There he is,\n                        big as Billy-be-frigged.

Give him some room, Percy,\n                        see what he does.\n\n              Percy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the\n              mouse. (Percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his\n              baton.) The mouse comes up to the desk as before.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Brave little bastard, gotta give\n                        him that.\n\n              Harry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. The\n              mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (Percy's hand inches ever\n              closer to his baton).\n\n                                  BILL\n                        Here, lemme try.\n\n              Bill drops a piece of cracker. The mouse ignores it\n              completely, keeping its beady little eyes on Harry. (Percy's\n              hand starts easing his baton from its holster.)\n\n                                  BILL\n                        Maybe he's full.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                               (grins)\n                        Maybe he knows you're just a\n                        floater.

Harry's smile fades. He and Bill trade a look.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        I was just kidding ab--\n\n              Percy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY (\"Yaaaahhh!\") and launches\n              his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone.\n\n              The mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over\n              his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the\n              floor. Apparently remembering a pressing engagement\n              elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the\n              restraint room.\n\n              Percy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying\n              to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping\n              with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by\n              inches...\n\n              ...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping\n              and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts\n              yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim\n              Thorpe heading for the endzone...\n\n              The mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room\n              door. Percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        FUCK!\n\n              He fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the\n              while:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD\n                        OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT!\n\n              OUTSIDE E BLOCK\n\n              Paul and Brutal are arriving for work--they pause, hearing\n              PERCY'S YELLS drifting from the windows. The regular CONS in\n              the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a\n              riot's brewing. Paul and Brutal take off running--\n\n              INSIDE E BLOCK\n\n              --and rush in to find:\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Percy met your mouse.\n\n              Harry points.

Brutal calls out to him:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Percy, we already tried that--\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        What?

He\n              steps back in and looks around, unable to believe there's no\n              mouse cowering in the corner. Paul and the men approach,\n              keeping straight faces, navigating the crap in the corridor.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Gosh. Ain't in there, huh?

BITTERBUCK'S CELL - NIGHT\n\n              Bitterbuck, the top of his head now shaved, is speaking\n              quietly as Paul listens:\n\n                                  BITTERBUCK\n                        You think if a man sincerely\n                        repents on what he done wrong, he\n                        might get to go back to the time\n                        that was happiest for him and live\n                        there forever? Could that be what\n                        heaven is like?\n\n              Paul doesn't think so--but that's not what Bitterbuck needs\n              to hear, so the lie comes easy:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I just about believe that very\n                        thing.\n\n              Pause. Bitterbuck smiles.\n\n                                  BITTERBUCK\n                        Had me a young wife when I was\n                        eighteen. Spent our first summer\n                        in the mountains. Made love every\n                        night. She'd just lie there after,\n                        bare-breasted in the firelight,\n                        and we'd talk sometimes till the\n                        sun come up.\n                               (beat)\n                        That was my best time.\n\n              Brutal appears at the door, checks his pocketwatch, nods to\n              Paul. Bitterbuck takes a deep breath, getting himself ready.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It'll be fine. You'll do fine.\n\n              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n              THE SPONGE is pulled sopping wet from the bucket of brine,\n              dripping a trail of water across the floor. Brutal places it\n              atop Bitterbuck's head. Water courses down the sides of the\n              condemned man's mask and neck, pooling on the floor.\n\n              The cap is lowered, the straps secured. All we hear now is\n              the sound of Bitterbuck's BREATHING growing louder and faster\n              under the mask...until, softly:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Roll on two.\n\n              WHAM! The switch is thrown. Bitterbuck surges forward against\n              the straps, riding the powerful current.\n\n              Some witnesses turn away. Paul and Brutal maintain grim eye\n              contact with each other, waiting.\n\n              Behind the partition, Percy watches through the mesh with\n              gleaming eyes, wishing he could see better.\n\n              Van Hay kills the current. Bitterbuck goes limp. A DOCTOR\n              steps forward, checks for a heartbeat, shakes his head.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Again.\n\n              The switch is thrown a second time. Bitterbuck surges forward\n              again, riding the current all the way...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n              Bitterbuck's dead face stares up at us from a gurney. A hand\n              reaches down, gives his cheek a squeeze.

COFFEY'S CELL - DAY\n\n              Coffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. He stirs at\n              the sound of GIGGLING. He sits up, peers curiously through\n              the bars. Softly:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Del?\n\n              AT THE GUARD STATION\n\n              Paul glances up from writing in the daily log. Silence now.\n              He goes back to writing--and the GIGGLING comes again.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Delacroix? That you?\n\n              No answer. Just more giggling. Paul rises, walks down the\n              Mile to Delacroix's cell--and stops, staring in through the\n              bars.\n\n              PAUL'S INNER OFFICE\n\n              Brutal and Dean are having lunch. Paul pokes his head in.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        You are not gonna believe this.\n\n              RESUME E BLOCK\n\n              The men follow Paul onto the Mile. By now, Del is CACKLING\n              WILDLY in his cell. Brutal shoots Paul a look--has he gone\n              insane? Paul gestures \"see for yourself.\"\n\n              They arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on Del's\n              shoulder. Del looks up, giggling like a kid at Christmas.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        Look!

Watch what he do!\n\n              He stretches out his left arm. The mouse crawls over the top\n              of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns\n              around and scampers back. The guards just stand there,\n              staring.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        Ain't he sumpthin now?

We\n                        play fetch?\n\n              He tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the\n              wall. The mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick--and\n              proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its\n              front paws all the way to Delacroix's feet.\n\n              By now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. Paul's got a funny\n              little chill running up his spine.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        He fetch it ever' time.

Again the mouse goes after it,\n              starts rolling it back. Del howls with laughter, claps his\n              hands like a kid. Brutal murmurs to the others:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Who's training who here?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        That's some smart mouse, Del.

The mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back...\n\n              ...as Percy enters the scene. Del catches sight of him and\n              scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. He\n              tries to hide Mr. Jingles in his hands--but the mouse\n              wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head,\n              where he regards Percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Well, well.

Of all the things they've seen in the last few\n              minutes, Percy being nice is the most amazing of all.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Man said get a cigar box.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

PAUL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n              Paul lies awake, watching Jan sleep. He looks troubled--not\n              to mention feverish. It occurs to him how badly he has to\n              pee. He sits up, clutching at a queasy stab of pain in his\n              groin...\n\n              LIVING ROOM STAIRS\n\n              ...and comes hurrying down the steps, clutching himself...\n\n              EXT.

He buckles to his knees--it's only his flailing\n              hand against the woodpile that prevents him from going face-\n              first into his own piss. He crams his other hand to his mouth\n              in an enormous effort not to scream and wake his wife.\n\n              He manages to ride it out until his bladder empties. He falls\n              onto his side, rolls over on the grass, and stares up at the\n              sky with both hands pressed to his groin.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        ...oh God...oh God...\n\n                                                       FADE TO BLACK\n\n              IN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS:\n\n                                    \"Coffey's Hands\"\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

ANGLE PANS TIGHT to Coffey at\n              his bars, eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear\n              or dread. Something bad's coming. A whisper:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Careful.\n\n              OUTSIDE E BLOCK\n\n              Billy is brought to the door.

In that moment, the slack look on Billy's face\n              gives way to a wild grin. A CRAZED SCREECH leaps from his\n              throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being\n              tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins--\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo!\n\n              --and he drops his wrist-chain down over Dean's head, jerks\n              it tight, begins to strangle him. Dean lurches forward, Billy\n              riding/propelling him through the door onto the Mile.\n\n              Percy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned. Harry shoves him\n              aside and jumps on Billy from behind, trying to get him off\n              Dean. Dean is choking, turning purple.\n\n              Paul rushes from the cell to join the fray. Billy whirls,\n              delivering a stunning kick to Paul's groin. Paul's bladder\n              pain goes nuclear--he falls back in agony, clutching himself\n              and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream.\n\n              Billy rams an elbow into Harry's face, knocks him sprawling\n              on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        WHOOOEE, BOYS!

He swings the baton\n              and lands an awesome blow to Billy's head--THUMP! The force\n              of it spins Billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back.\n\n              Dean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air. Amazingly,\n              Billy's still conscious--he looks up at Brutal and laughs:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No\n                        fair.\n\n              Still laughing, he makes another grab at Dean. Brutal whacks\n              him again, turning his lights out for good. Brutal drops to\n              Dean's side, helping him hack air back into his lungs:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Breathe...breathe...that's it...\n\n              Everybody's reining in their adrenaline.

Didn't we all of us\n                        think he was doped?\n\n              Percy nods, still numb. Paul is furious:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        You didn't ask?

Go on now.\n\n              They all exit. As soon as he's alone, Paul gives in to the\n              pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a\n              moan. It's so bad he actually lays down on the Mile, face\n              pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead. A\n              stretch of silence...and then:\n\n                                  COFFEY (O.S.)\n                        Boss?

I\n                        needs ta talk t'ya.\n\n              Paul sighs. Things couldn't get much worse than this. He\n              rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the Mile...\n\n              COFFEY'S CELL\n\n              ...and finds Coffey waiting at his bars.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Closer.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I'm alone here right now, John.\n                        Figure this is close enough.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Boss, please. I got to whisper in\n                        your ear.\n\n              Paul blinks. Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or\n              maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like? He tries\n              to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        Boss?

Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver...\n\n              ...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip\n              from the gun--no need for that. Coffey's hand then drifts\n              slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch...\n\n                                  PAUL\n                               (stunned, frozen)\n                        What are you...doing?\n\n              ...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body. He arches\n              back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of\n              energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand...\n\n              ...and then it's over. Paul comes back to the real world,\n              weak against the bars, realizes Del is hollering in his cell:\n\n                                  DEL\n                        HELP!

Fever's gone. So is\n              the pain in his groin. John Coffey, though, seems to be\n              having trouble. He sits down on his bunk, bends forward,\n              gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        John? John, what's wrong?\n\n              Paul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open\n              the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger\n              like a cat trying to cough up a hairball...\n\n              ...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as\n              Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful\n              sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black\n              insects. They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn\n              white...and disappear. Paul just stares, stunned. Softly:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        What did you do, big boy?

Awful\n                        tired now, boss. Dog tired.\n\n              He rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall. Paul just stares at\n              him, stunned. He turns and walks up the Mile, his stiffness\n              and pain now gone. Del watches him go by, also stunned:\n\n                                  DEL\n                        What dat man do to you?

Not trusting this\n              situation for even a moment, Paul opens his fly, takes a deep\n              breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee...\n\n              ...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl.\n              The look on Paul's face says it all--blessed relief.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

Jan's at the counter,\n              slicing vegetables for dinner. She glances at him.\n\n                                  JAN\n                        Hi, honey.

Satisfy my curiosity,\n                        I'll see if I can satisfy yours.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I've wondered if he ever did\n                        anything like that before.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        Why? Has he said anything?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        No. But a man who does a thing\n                        like that has often developed a\n                        taste for it over time. Occurred\n                        to me it might be easy enough to\n                        follow his backtrail and find out.\n                        A man his size, and colored to\n                        boot, can't be that hard to trace.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        You'd think so, but you'd be\n                        wrong. Believe me, we tried. It's\n                        like he dropped out of the sky.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        How do you explain that?\n\n                                  BURT\n                        We're in a Depression. A third of\n                        the country's out of work.\n\n                        People are drifting by the\n                        thousands, looking for work,\n                        looking for that greener grass.\n                        Even a giant like Coffey wouldn't\n                        get noticed everywhere he goes...\n                        not until he kills a couple of\n                        little girls.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        He's...strange, I admit. But there\n                        doesn't seem to be any real\n                        violence in him. I know violent\n                        men, Mr. Hammersmith. I deal with\n                        'em day in and day out.\n\n              Burt smiles, realizing:\n\n                                  BURT\n                        You didn't come up here to ask me\n                        whether he might have killed\n                        before. You came up here to see if\n                        I think he did it at all. That's\n                        it, isn't it?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Do you?\n\n                                  BURT\n                        One seldom sees a less ambiguous\n                        case. He was found with the\n                        victims in his arms. Blurted out\n                        a confession right then and there.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Yet you defended him.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        Everyone is entitled to a defense.\n\n              Cynthia hollers from an open window:\n\n                                  CYNTHIA\n                        Kids!

Burt turns back to Paul.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        Tell you something. You listen\n                        close, too, because it might be\n                        something you need to know.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I'm listening.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        We had us a dog. No particular\n                        breed, but gentle. Ready to lick\n                        your hand or fetch a stick. Just\n                        a sweet mongrel, you know the kind.\n                               (Paul nods)\n                        In many way, a good mongrel dog is\n                        like you negro. You get to know\n                        it, and often you get to love it.\n                        It is of no particular use, but\n                        you keep it around because you\n                        think it loves you. If you're\n                        lucky, Mr. Edgecomb, you never\n                        have to find out any different. My\n                        wife and I were not so lucky.\n                        Caleb. Come here for a second.\n\n              The little boy comes to him, staring at his feet. Burt tires\n              to raise the boy's chin. The boy resists for a moment...\n\n                                  BURT\n                        Please, son.\n\n              ...and then his face comes around. He's horribly scarred on\n              that side, the eye missing.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        He has the one eye. I suppose he's\n                        lucky not to be blind. We get down\n                        on our knees and thank God for\n                        that much at least. Right Caleb?\n                               (the boy nods shyly)\n                        Okay, go on in now.\n\n              The boy races inside after his sister. Paul follows Burt's\n              gaze off toward the rear of the property, where an unoccupied\n              doghouse stands weathered and sad in the weeds.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        That dog attacked my boy for no\n                        reason. Just got it into his mind\n                        one day. Same with John Coffey. He\n                        was sorry afterwards, of that I\n                        have no doubt...but those little\n                        girls stayed raped and murdered\n                        nonetheless. Maybe he's never done\n                        it before--my dog never bit\n                        before, but I didn't concern\n                        myself with that. I went out there\n                        with my rifle and grabbed his\n                        collar and blew his brains out.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I'm sorry for your trouble.\n\n              Burt acknowledges the condolence with a gracious nod.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        I'm as enlightened as the next\n                        man, Mr. Edgecomb. I would not\n                        bring back slavery for all the tea\n                        in China. I believe we have to be\n                        humane and generous in our efforts\n                        to solve the race problem. But we\n                        have to remember that the negro\n                        will bite if he gets the chance,\n                        just like a mongrel dog will bite\n                        if it crosses its mind to do so.\n                               (beat)\n                        Is Coffey guilty? Yes, he is.\n                        Don't you doubt it, and don't you\n                        turn your back on him. You might\n                        get away with it once or even a\n                        hundred times...but in the end...\n\n              He raises his hand, making biting motions with his fingers.\n\n                                  BURT\n                        You understand?\n\n              Paul says nothing. Burt gazes out again. Softly:\n\n                                  BURT\n                        I'm gonna have to tear that old\n                        doghouse down one of these days.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

Whatever he's carrying, the\n              smell of it brings Del to his bars.

He sits\n              up, wipes the tears leaking from his eyes, looks at Paul.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I'm smelling me some cornbread.\n\n              Paul speaks softly so the others can't hear:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It's from my missus.

Billy howls\n              with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it?\n                        Oh, the look on your face!\n\n              Paul and Brutal come running. Harry's just flabbergasted:\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        You believe this?

I'll have\n                        'em out t'yall tomorrow!\n\n              Paul stays calm, turns to Brutal, nods at the restraint room.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        We've been looking to clear that\n                        room out anyway.\n\n                                                       TIMECUT:\n\n              A STREAM OF GUARDS comes toting the last of the restraint\n              room stuff past Billy's cell while he heckles them from the\n              bars...\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Hey!

Y'can shine my knob for me\n                        while yer at it!\n\n              ...and he pauses as Paul and Brutal step to the bars. Paul\n              has a canvas straitjacket. Brutal pulls his nightstick.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        You can come in here on your legs,\n                        but you'll go out on your backs,\n                        Billy the Kid guarantee ya that.\n                               (motions to Brutal)\n                        C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up\n                        on me this time. We'll go man to\n                        man, see who's the better fel--\n\n              Brutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing Harry\n              pointing a fire hose. The hose erupts, driving Billy across\n              the cell with bone-jarring force. They batter him half-\n              senseless, then cut the water. Billy collapses in a heap.\n\n              Paul and Brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get\n              the straitjacket on him. He comes around as they draw the\n              straps tight and pull him to his feet.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        C'mon, Wild Bill.

Wild Bill\n                        Hickock wasn't no range rider! He\n                        was just a bushwackin' John Law!\n                        Dumb sonovabitch sat with his back\n                        to the door and kilt by a drunk!\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Oh, my suds and body!

Billy\n              sees where they intend to put him, resorts to pleading:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Oh, not in there!

Ummmmhhhh...urg...ah!\n\n              He suddenly drops to the floor, bucking and jerking wildly,\n              spewing drool. Harry's eyes go wide.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Holy Christ, he's pitchin' a fit!\n\n              Paul reaches down and unceremoniously starts dragging Billy\n              kicking and writhing the rest of the way.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        He'll be fine, boys. Trust me on\n                        this one.\n\n              Brutal helps Paul toss Billy headlong into the padded room.\n              They slam the door...\n\n              RESTRAINT ROOM\n\n              ...and Billy staggers to his feet in the straitjacket,\n              inarticulate with rage, starts throwing himself against the\n              door, screaming at the top of his lungs.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        ALL I WANTED ME WAS A LITTLE\n                        CORNBREAD, YOU MUTHERFUCKERS!\n\n                                                       FADE TO:\n\n              INT. E BLOCK - NEXT DAY\n\n              Paul and Brutal unlock the restraint room. Billy looks up\n              from the corner, pale and drained. Softly:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        I learnt my lesson. I'll be good.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT. E BLOCK - DAY\n\n              Billy's back in his cell, quiet for a change. Toot-Toot is\n              outside the bars, mopping the floor. Billy notices a\n              chocolate Moon Pie in Toot's shirt pocket.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Pssss. Hey. Give'ya nickel for\n                        that Moon Pie.\n\n              Toot looks around. Nobody's watching, and a nickel's a\n              nickel. He steps to Billy's bars, swaps the Moon Pie for the\n              money.\n\n              Toot hurries away. Billy unwraps the Moon Pie, makes sure\n              he's not being watched...and crams the entire thing into his\n              mouth...\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE:\n\n              ...and here comes Brutal strolling down the Mile, doing a\n              cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, seeing:\n\n              Billy at his bars. Just standing there staring. His cheeks\n              bulging way out.\n\n              Brutal steps closer, fascinated...what the fuck is that.\n              Billy waits until he's just a bit closer--\n\n              --and he slams his fists against his own cheeks, propelling\n              a disgusting spew of liquefied chocolate sludge into Brutal's\n              face. Billy falls back onto his bunk, shrieking with laughter:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss,\n                        yassuh, howdoo you do?\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                               (beat, calmly)\n                        Hope your bags are packed.\n\n                                                       TIMECUT:\n\n              ...and once again, Billy gets dragged to the restraint room,\n              kicking and screaming all the way. They toss him in, slam the\n              door. Brutal turns, still wiping traces of sludge off.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        The Moon Pie thing was pretty\n                        original. Gotta give him that.\n\n              Brutal nods. They walk away as we\n\n                                                       FADE TO:\n\n              INT.

He scrounges up Mr.\n              Jingles props, steps from his cell, looks to Harry and Dean.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        You fellas comin'?\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        We got other fish to fry just now,\n                        Del, but you knock 'em for a loop.\n\n              Del nods, beaming happily, looks to Coffey in his cell.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        You knock 'em for a loop like Mr.\n                        Harry says, Del.\n\n              Brutal leads Del up the Mile, Paul and the others at their\n              heels. Percy's at the duty desk. He smirks and rolls his eyes\n              as Del goes by. The moment Brutal and Del are out the door...\n\n              ...Toot emerges from Paul's office where he's been hiding.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Let's move along briskly, folks.\n                        There's not much time.\n\n              Toot hurries down to take his place in Del's cell.\n\n                                  TOOT\n                        I'm sittin' down, I'm sittin'\n                        down, I'm sittin' down.\n\n              INT.

Everybody takes a seat. Del is ushered\n              in by Brutal. Del faces his audience, puts his hands to his\n              chest in a \"thank you\" gesture worthy of Lillie Langtry\n              before her adoring public, then announces grandly:\n\n                                  DEL\n                        Messieurs et mesdames!

Percy looks anxiously to Paul, who's trading glances\n              with the other guards. Finally:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Very good.

E BLOCK - DAY\n\n              ...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for\n              Del's return. Percy actually looks happy for a change,\n              feeling genuinely accepted for the first time...\n\n              Billy is watching from his cell. Just watching.\n\n              The door opens. Del returns with Mr. Jingles on his shoulder,\n              escorted by Brutal. Brutal is toting the cigar box and spool\n              like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Well?\n\n                                  DEL\n                        They love Mr. Jingles!

Pop back\n                        in your cell, old-timer.\n\n              The generosity of Percy's tone catches Del completely off\n              guard. Del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust...\n\n              ...and the old Percy comes back. He bares his teeth in a mock\n              snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab Del. It's a joke,\n              but Del doesn't know that--he jerks back in fear and trips\n              over Brutal's big feet. Del goes down hard, hitting the\n              linoleum with the back of his head. Mr. Jingles jumps clear,\n              goes squeaking down the Mile. Del sits up, painfully\n              clutching his head. Brutal helps him up...\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Percy, you shit.\n\n              ...and moves him toward his cell. Percy is actually moved to\n              apologize--he starts after them with a half-laugh, drifting\n              much too close to Wild Bill's side of the Mile...\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Del!

You all ri--\n\n              ...and Wild Bill's arms thrust out, grabbing Percy and\n              slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his\n              throat. Percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter-chute,\n              thinking he's gonna die. The guards scramble, drawing their\n              clubs--as Billy strokes Percy's hair and whispers in his ear:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Ain't you sweet.

There's a SOFT SNAP as the mouse's back breaks.\n\n              Del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing\n              the mouse's name. Percy looks to Brutal and Paul, smiles.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Knew I'd get him sooner or later.\n                        Just a matter of time, really.\n\n              He turns and strolls up the Mile, leaving Mr. Jingles dying\n              in a tiny pool of blood. Up at the duty desk, Dean and Harry\n              get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious.\n\n              Percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. Del is\n              still screaming, all his pent-up terror and grief pouring out\n              at the dying mouse. And then comes a soft, urgent voice:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Give'm to me.\n\n              They turn. Coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one\n              massive hand spread open.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Give'm to me. Might still be time.\n\n              Paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at\n              the feel of it. Splintered bones are poking at the hide.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        What are you doing?\n\n              Paul doesn't answer, just lays Mr. Jingles into Coffey's\n              hand. Coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his\n              other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. All we see\n              now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Paul, what the hell--\n\n              Paul motions him quiet.

Everybody watching now.\n\n              Coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply.\n              The world hangs suspended for a moment. Coffey raises his\n              face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those\n              horrendous choking sounds in his throat...\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                               (softly)\n                        Oh, dear Jesus. The tail. Look at\n                        the tail.\n\n              They do. The tail is no longer weak and dying. It's snapping\n              briskly back and forth, as if ready to play.\n\n              Coffey makes that retching/gagging sound...and again exhales\n              a cloud of swirling black \"insects\" from his nose and mouth.\n              The men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and\n              disappear.\n\n              Coffey bends down, opens his hand. Mr. Jingles bounds off his\n              fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. They\n              turn to see Del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying.\n              Dean turns back to Coffey with a stunned whisper:\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        What did you do?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I helped Del's mouse.

A storm is\n              brewing, sending FLASHES OF LIGHTNING across the floors.\n\n              INT. DEL'S CELL - NIGHT\n\n              Del sits with Mr. Jingles in his lap, stroking the mouse\n              between the ears. Paul, Brutal, and Harry appear at the bars.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        Hey, boys.

Mr. Jingles steps off onto Paul's\n              shoulder with no hesitation. Gently:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Del.

The mouse skitters off Paul's\n              shoulder onto Coffey's hand.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        People pay a dime apiece to see\n                        him.

Rain is pissing down, drumming\n              the tin roof. People glance up uneasily as THUNDER BOOMS. A\n              FAT LADY is staring grimly at the electric chair.\n\n                                  FAT LADY\n                        Hope he's good and scared.

The straps are drawn tight.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Roll on one.\n\n              The lights brighten on a RISING HUM. Witnesses look up.\n\n              ON THE MILE\n\n              Coffey looks up as the overheads flare hotter and hotter,\n              whispers to the mouse in his hands:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        You be still, Mr. Jingles.

Doesn't quite manage the first time.\n              Licks his lips and tries again.\n\n                                  DEL\n                        I sorry for what I do. I give\n                        anything to take it back, but I\n                        can't. God have mercy on me.\n                               (whispers to Paul)\n                        Don' forget 'bout Mouseville.\n\n              Paul and Brutal nod--and are stunned as:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        No such place. That's just a fairy\n                        tale these guys told you to keep\n                        you quiet. Just thought you should\n                        know, faggot.\n\n              The stricken look in Del's eyes tells us a part of him had\n              known all along. Paul and Brutal would both like to deck\n              Percy right about now, and he knows it--he gives them a \"what\n              are you gonna do about it\" smile.\n\n              Nothing they can do. Paul nods to Harry, who takes the black\n              mask from the back of the chair and rolls it down over Del's\n              head, leaving the top of his shaved head exposed.\n\n              PERCY\n\n              takes the sponge and bends down to the bucket of brine. The\n              other don't see it, but we do:\n\n              Percy only pretends to dip the sponge and soak it. It never\n              touches the water. He straightens up and places the sponge\n              atop Delacroix's head, hiding it with his hands.\n\n              The cap is lowered. Paul and the others haven't yet realized\n              what's happened. THUNDER BOOMS and LIGHTNING CRASHES as Percy\n              hides a smile, steps back to address the condemned:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Electricity shall now be passed\n                        through your body until you are\n                        dead, in accordance with state\n                        law. God have mercy on your soul.\n\n              TIGHT ON PAUL\n\n              as realization starts to dawn. He stares at the bucket, then\n              across the floor to Delacroix, coming to terms with the\n              evidence of his eyes--there's no water on the floor or\n              dripping down the sides of Del's neck.\n\n              Paul's eyes widen. A stunned beat of horror. He starts to\n              open his mouth to scream \"NO!\", but Percy beats him to it\n              with:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Roll on two.\n\n              Van Hay flicks the switch. WHAM. The electricity hits home\n              and Del rocks forward, riding the current.\n\n              Then things start to go horribly wrong.\n\n              The HUMMING loses its steadiness and starts to waver with a\n              CRACKLING SOUND. Tendrils of smoke begin curling from under\n              the cap, a mixture of burning hair and sponge. Brutal shoots\n              Paul a horrified look. Paul responds with a harsh whisper:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It's dry!\n\n              Delacroix begins twisting and jittering in the chair, his\n              masked face snapping violently from side to side, his legs\n              pistoning up and down in his restraints.\n\n              There's a MUFFLED POP from under the cap, like a pine knot\n              exploding in a hot fire. Smoke starts coming through the\n              fabric of the mask, puffing upward. Del is being cooked\n              alive. Paul spins to the partition, hollering--\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        JACK!\n\n              --but Brutal grabs his arm, whispers fiercely:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Don't you tell him to stop. Don't\n                        you do it. It's too late for that.\n\n              Paul turns back, helpless. The other guards are trading wild\n              looks, unable to believe what's happening. Even Percy looks\n              aghast--he was expecting something, but not this.\n\n              Del begins SCREAMING--the wild, hysterical sound of an animal\n              being shredded alive in a hay baler. The HUMMING goes uneven\n              and ragged, the lights rising and falling...\n\n              ON THE MILE\n\n              ...as Del's screams rise and fall with them, echoing up the\n              corridor. Coffey's shaking and screaming too, as if feeling\n              Del's pain. Mr. Jingles squirms out of his grasp and goes\n              squeaking in terror toward the restraint room door...\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        HE'S COOKIN' NOW! THEY COOKIN' HIM\n                        GOOD! NEAR ABOUT DONE, I RECKON!\n\n              RESUME EXECUTION CHAMBER\n\n              Wrong. Del's nowhere near about done. He's slamming back and\n              forth in the chair hard enough to shake the platform,\n              twisting hard against the leather restraints. We hear BONES\n              BREAKING. A WOMAN'S SCREAMS. Witnesses start rising to their\n              feet:\n\n                                  WITNESSES\n                        What the hell's happening to\n                        him?...Are those clamps going to\n                        hold?...Christ, the smell!...Is\n                        this normal?\n\n              The mask bursts into flame on Delacroix's face. Van Hay\n              hollers through the wire mesh, horrified:\n\n                                  VAN HAY\n                        SHOULD I KILL THE JUICE?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        NO! ROLL, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE, ROLL!\n\n              Harry scoops up the bucket of water to throw it.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        No water! No water! You crazy?\n\n              Harry backs off with a look of dazed understanding--you don't\n              throw water on a man getting juiced. Right. He drops the\n              bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead.\n\n              The flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face.\n              His eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown\n              out of their sockets. The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away.\n\n              Pandemonium now in the room. People shouting and hurrying to\n              exit, chairs falling over, women screaming:\n\n                                  FAT LADY\n                        Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see\n                        he's had enough?\n\n              Hal grabs Paul by the shoulder, spins him around.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Why don't you shut it down?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        He's still alive! You want me to\n                        shut down while he's still alive?\n\n              Hal is horrified at the thought. Del is jittering and\n              screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his\n              nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple-black.\n\n              The witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out, but the\n              back door is locked. All they can do is cluster there.\n\n              Paul sees Percy with his head turned away. He grabs him,\n              forces his head around.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        You watch, you son of a bitch!\n\n              Harry steps up, the extinguisher in his hands. Waiting. Del\n              finally slumps over. He still vibrating, but now it's just\n              the effect of current flowing through his body.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Kill it!\n\n              Van Hay kills the current. The HUMMING DIES. Brutal grabs the\n              extinguisher from Harry, shoves it into Percy's hands.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You do it.

Hal is near the back, calming the crowd:\n\n                                  HAL\n                        It's all right, folks, it's all\n                        under control.

Paul plugs them into his ears. People are\n              moaning and sobbing at the back of the room:\n\n                                  MAN\n                        Oh my God!

I\n                        never would have come!\n\n              Paul wipes some foam away from Delacroix's chest, places the\n              stethoscope pad to the raw flesh. He nods to Brutal--it's\n              over.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

Serving plates are being passes, everybody digging in:\n\n                                  THE MEN\n                               (various, ad-lib)\n                        Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up\n                        some fine chicken...Brutal, don't\n                        hog the taters now...Try that corn\n                        yet?

Dean puts his chicken down, wipes\n              his hands. Looks are traded in the silence.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        I could'a gone the rest of the day\n                        without you bringing that up.\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        I could'a gone the rest of the\n                        year.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        He did it to me too. He put his\n                        hands on me and took my bladder\n                        infection away.\n\n              The men absorb this.

Melinda Moores?\n\n              Paul nods--that's who we're talking about.\n\n                                  JAN\n                        You really think you can help her?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It's not a bladder infection, or\n                        even a busted-up mouse. But there\n                        might be a chance.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Hold on now. You're talking about\n                        our jobs.

You\n                        know him, he wouldn't believe\n                        something unless it fell on him.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        So you're talking about taking\n                        John Coffey to her. That's more\n                        than just our jobs, Paul.\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        Damn right.

Brutal, help me\n                        out here...\n\n              Brutal lets out a deep breath, considering. He looks to Paul.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        I'm sure she's a fine woman...\n\n                                  JAN\n                        The finest.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        What's happening to her is an\n                        offense, Brutal.

Let's not forget Coffey's\n                        a murderer. What if he escapes?\n                        I'd hate losing my job or going to\n                        prison, but I'd hate having a dead\n                        child on my conscience even more.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I don't think that'll happen...\n                               (beat, softly)\n                        ...in fact, I don't think he did\n                        it at all.\n\n              The men are stunned by this.

Plus, he's huge. If he\n                        tried to get away, it'd take a lot\n                        of bullets to stop him.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        We'd all have shotguns in addition\n                        to sidearms.

The book he\n              was reading falls to the floor--\n\n              --and a \"Tijuana Bible\" is revealed within the pages. It's a\n              pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's,\n              featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or\n              movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts.

The word\n              balloon over his head features his famous laugh: \"Uk-uk-uk-\n              uk!\"\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Oooo, Poicy! What would your\n                        mother say?\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Let go, you ignoramus! I know\n                        people!

C'mon, stick out\n                        your arms like a good boy.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        I won't.

Percy lets out\n              a shriek--not just of pain, but a dismayed understanding that\n              he's not going to bluster his way out of this one.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You gonna put your arms up?

I'd do as he says.\n\n              Percy jerks his arms up before him. They get the straitjacket\n              on him within seconds. Percy turns to Paul on the verge of\n              tears. Softly:\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Please, Paul. Don't put me in with\n                        Wild Bill.

E BLOCK - NIGHT\n\n              ...and they bring him down the Mile to the restraint room\n              door. Brutal takes Percy's holster and baton.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        You'll get 'em back, don't worry.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        That's more than I can say about\n                        your jobs. All your jobs! You\n                        can't do this to me! You can't!\n\n              Paul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Let you in on a little secret. We\n                        can and we are.\n\n              He slaps the tape over Percy's mouth and shoves him back into\n              the restraint room. Percy stands breathing heavily through\n              his nose, making muffled mmmmph-mmmph! sounds under the tape.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        You're going to have a few hours\n                        of quiet time now, so you can\n                        reflect on what you did to Del.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                               (grins)\n                        If you get lonely, think about\n                        Olive Oyl...\n                               (thrusting his hips)\n                        ...uk-uk-uk-uk!\n\n              And they slam the door, shutting Percy into darkness.\n\n              A WALL-MOUNTED GUN SAFE\n\n              is unlocked, shotguns pulled out. The men load up, heading\n              down the Mile as:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        One more time--what do you say if\n                        somebody comes by?\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        Coffey got upset, so we put him in\n                        the restraint room. They hear any\n                        noise, they'll think it's him.\n\n              They come to Coffey's cell.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        We goan for the ride now?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        That's right.\n\n              The cell is unlocked. Coffey emerges. Paul motions them\n              along, still grilling Dean:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        What about us?\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        You're over in Admin, going over\n                        Del's file. Brutal and Harry are\n                        in the laundry doing their wash--\n\n              A skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from Wild Bill's cell\n              and grabs Coffey by the wrist. The men gasp, shocked to see\n              Billy on his feet, grinning and weaving like a punch-drunk.\n\n              Coffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually\n              trembling at Billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were\n              engaged. His eyes are wide and horrified, as if he'd just put\n              his hand in a basket full of snakes. He tries to pull away,\n              but Billy has him tight, that mysterious circuit blazing.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                               (slurring wildly)\n                        Where you fink you're goin'?\n\n              Coffey responds softly, with utmost horror:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        You're a bad man.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want.\n\n              Paul plucks Billy's hand off Coffey's arm--and Coffey\n              flinches back as the circuit is broken.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Whooeee. Whole room's spinning.\n                        Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me\n                        some shine or what?\n\n              He turns and staggers back to his bunk, muttering all the way:\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        Niggers oughtta have they own\n                        'lectric chair.

Coffey is still staring.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        He's a bad man.\n\n              INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n              Coffey is brought in...and freezes in horror at the sight of\n              Old Sparky. A whisper:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        They're still in there. Pieces of\n                        them, still in there. I hear them\n                        screaming.\n\n              All eyes go to the electric chair. It sits shrouded in shadow\n              like an ominous throne. Never before has this place felt so\n              haunted to the men. It makes the hairs on the neck stand up.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        John, come along! Right now,\n                        y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door!\n\n              Coffey finally responds, pulling away...\n\n              INT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n              ...and they come down the steps. They realize Coffey will\n              have to stoop all the way down the tunnel. Paul pats the\n              gurney.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Lie down on this.\n                               (off Coffey's look)\n                        It'll be easier for you and no\n                        harder for us.\n\n              Coffey eases carefully onto the gurney, lying on his back.\n              His knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground,\n              but it works. They push him along, traversing the pools of\n              light.\n\n              Coffey actually starts to smile. He reaches out his arms,\n              fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Say. This is fun.\n\n              EXT. PRISON WALL - NIGHT\n\n              A massive iron door SQUEALS open onto a little-used fenced\n              enclosure. Paul and the others bring Coffey up from the\n              tunnel below, emerging into the night. Coffey's breath\n              catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady\n                        in the rocking chair!\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Shhh. John, you have to be quiet\n                        now.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                               (whispering)\n                        You see her? You see the lady?\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        We see her, John.\n\n              Harry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to\n              unlock the gate...\n\n              WIDE SHOT OF PRISON\n\n              ...while TOWER GUARDS huddle in their enclosure atop the\n              walls. An occasional SPOTLIGHT cuts the darkness. FIREFLIES\n              dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see.\n\n              Four dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across\n              the lonely country road into the fields on the far side...\n\n              EXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\n              Coffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. TILT UP to his\n              face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell.\n\n              He see the guards throwing him anxious looks. He misreads\n              this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. They do it,\n              just to make him happy.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        C'mon, big boy, keep moving.\n\n              A FEW FIREFLIES come winking through frame as the group\n              presses on...\n\n              ANOTHER AREA/WOODS\n\n              The trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. MORE\n              FIREFLIES are flitting into view, trailing in their wake...\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        How far is it?\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Just up ahead...\n\n              Harry brings them to a thicket of trees. They start removing\n              branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old FARMALL TRUCK\n              hidden in the brush.\n\n              The men pause. Even more fireflies are swirling around them,\n              growing in number. It's getting downright weird.\n\n              Coffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. A childlike\n              smile has utterly transformed his face. He raises his hand,\n              letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Hey there, little firefly. Where's\n                        Mrs. Firefly this evening?\n\n              Another firefly joins the first, both now dancing and\n              blinking around his fingers. Coffey laughs again.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Oh, there you is. You come out to\n                        play too?\n\n              The men stand gaping. The fireflies are flitting to Coffey as\n              if to a beacon. He waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking\n              and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust.\n\n              They begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing\n              planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off\n              his ebony skin. Coffey's eyes meet Paul's.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        They seem...drawn to you.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I love 'em, is why. They don't\n                        think no hurtful thoughts. They's\n                        just happy to be. Happy little\n                        lightning bugs...\n\n              The men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified.\n              Harry gives Paul a look--can we go? Please?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy.\n\n              Coffey clambers up on the stakebed. Paul and Brutal join him.\n              Harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button...\n\n              ON THE STAKEBED\n\n              ...while Coffey sits with his back to the cab.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        John? Do you know where we're\n                        taking you?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Help a lady?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        That's right. Help a lady. But how\n                        did you know?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I\n                        don't know much'a anything. Never\n                        have.\n\n              The truck pulls out. Coffey waves as the fireflies get left\n              behind, dwindling away like stars.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Bye, fireflies. Bye.\n\n              WIDE ANGLE OF COUNTRYSIDE\n\n              The truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless\n              fireflies swirling in its wake...\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n              EXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n              Headlights come over the rise. The truck appears, rumbling\n              down toward the house. The world is isolated and still.\n\n              IN THE TRUCK CAB\n\n              Harry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on.\n              Silence now, save for the trilling of crickets.\n\n              IN THE STAKEBED\n\n              Paul and Brutal both look terrified now that they're actually\n              here. An urgent whisper:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        We can still turn back.\n\n              Paul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Boss, look. Someone's up.\n\n              Lights are coming on inside the house. Coffey rises and steps\n              down from the truck, pulling Paul along. Brutal follows them.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        This is a mistake. Christ, Paul,\n                        what were we thinking?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Too late now. Harry, keep John\n                        here until we call you.\n\n              Paul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside\n              the house keep clicking on. The last one finally comes on\n              over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin\n              barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Who the hell goes there at two-\n                        thirty in the goddamn morning?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Hal, it's us! It's Paul and\n                        Brutal--it's us!\n\n              The door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard\n              in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them:\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Paul, what are you doing here at\n                        this hour? Jesus, it's not a\n                        lockdown, is it? Or a riot?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Hal, God's sakes, take your finger\n                        off the trigger...\n\n              Hal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Are you hostages? Who's out there?\n                        Who's by that truck?\n\n              Coffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry tugging\n              on his arm, trying to hold him back. Hal cocks both hammers.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        John Coffey! Halt! Halt right\n                        there or I shoot!\n\n              His aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs:\n\n                                  MELINDA (O.S.)\n                        Hal? Who are you talking to, you\n                        fucking cocksucker?\n\n              A frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives him a look--is\n              that Melinda?\n\n              Hal's shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in front\n              of the muzzle.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        No one's hurt. We're here to help.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Help what? I don't understand. Is\n                        this a prison break?\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I can't explain what it is. You\n                        just have to trust me.\n\n              Coffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before\n              the warden. Hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's\n              that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        What do you...want?\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Hal! Make them go away! No\n                        salesmen in the middle of the\n                        night! No Fuller brushes! No\n                        French knickers with come in the\n                        crotch! Tell them to take a flying\n                        fuck in a rolling d...d...\n\n              We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING, then she begins to sob.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                               (a whisper)\n                        Just to help. Just to help, boss,\n                        that's all.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        You can't. No one can.\n\n              Coffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hal's grasp, hands it to\n              Paul. Coffey moves past Hal into the house...\n\n              INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n              ...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs.\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Don't you go up there! Don't you\n                        do it!\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Boss, you just be quiet now and\n                        let me be.\n\n              Coffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels,\n              heading up toward that quavering voice:\n\n                                  MELINDA (O.S.)\n                        Stay out of here! Whoever you are,\n                        just stay out! I'm not dressed for\n                        visitors, you rat's asshole!\n\n              INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n              Coffey enters, trailed by the others. Paul pauses, horrified.\n\n              The woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores\n              anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid\n              skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her\n              mouth twisted. Yellowish bile stains her chin and the front\n              of her nightgown. Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her\n              eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest:\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Oh, so big! Pull down your pants!\n                        Let's have a look!\n\n              Hal groans with despair. Coffey just stands there for a\n              moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the\n              bed...\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Don't come near me, pigfucker.\n\n              ...but as he draws closer, a change occurs. Her features\n              soften, her eyes become more sane and aware.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Why do you have so many scars? Who\n                        hurt you so badly?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Don't hardly remember, ma'am.\n\n              Coffey sits on the edge of the bed. The lights seem to flare\n              hotter and brighter. Tears are forming in Melinda's eyes.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        What's your name?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        John Coffey, ma'am. Like the\n                        drink, only not spelt the same.\n\n              She lays back, staring at him with shining fascination. The\n              world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed...\n\n              ...and he starts bending slowly toward her.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Ma'am?\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Yes, John Coffey?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I see it. I see it.\n\n              He comes closer...closer still...\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        You be still now. You be so quiet\n                        and so still.\n\n              He brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper\n              of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers. For a moment\n              we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an\n              expression of surprise...\n\n              ...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips\n              on hers. We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling\n              the air deeply from her lungs. Something hot and glowing\n              starts passing between them, drawn on his breath...\n\n              The men watch. The house seems to shudder in that moment, as\n              if the entire world has shifted an inch to the right...\n\n              DOWNSTAIRS PARLOR\n\n              ...and the grandfather clock stops ticking, the pendulum\n              stopping dead, the glass face cracking neatly up the center...\n\n              BEDROOM\n\n              ...and a windowpane cracks. Then another. A picture falls off\n              the wall. A lightbulb bursts, showering glass.\n\n              Paul smells smoke, realizes the fringed coverlet of the bed\n              has caught fire. Moving like a man in a dream, he reaches for\n              the waterglass on the nightstand, douses the flames.\n\n              Coffey keeps kissing Melinda in that deep and mysterious way,\n              inhaling and inhaling, her hand held in his like a tiny white\n              bird. For a moment we actually hear something screaming, as\n              if some willful imp were being extracted by force...\n\n              ...and then it's over. Coffey raises his head, revealing:\n\n              Melinda's beautiful face. Her mouth no longer droops. Color\n              is coming back to her hair. Her skin is shining with life.\n\n              Coffey regards her raptly for a moment or two, then starts\n              coughing violently.\n\n              He turns away and drops to his knees, hacking like a man in\n              the last stages of tuberculosis.\n\n              Paul and his men are expecting Coffey to spit out the \"bugs\",\n              but he doesn't--he just keeps coughing, deep and hard, barely\n              finding time to snatch in the next breath of air.\n\n              Hal goes to his wife, beyond stunned, sits at her side. She\n              looks back at him with amazement, her face like a dirty\n              mirror that's been suddenly wiped clean.\n\n              John's coughing grows even worse. Brutal drops to his side\n              and slaps his broad, spasming back.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        John! Sick it up! Cough 'em out\n                        like you done before!\n\n              Coffey just keeps retching, eyes watering from the strain,\n              spit flying from his mouth.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        He's choking! Whatever he sucked\n                        out of her, he's choking on it!\n\n              Paul starts toward them. Coffey crawls away, pressing himself\n              into a corner with his face against the wallpaper. He's still\n              making gruesome deep hacking sounds, but getting it under\n              control. He weakly waves Paul off--let me be.\n\n              Paul looks to the bed. Hal sits with Melinda, stroking her\n              brow. Color is blooming in her cheeks even as we watch.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        How did I get here? We were going\n                        to the hospital in Indianola,\n                        weren't we? We stopped and you\n                        bought me a packet of posies...\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Shhh. It doesn't matter. It\n                        doesn't matter anymore.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Did I have the X-ray? Did I\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Yes.\n\n              They both look at him.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        It was clear. There was no tumor.\n\n              Hal bursts into tears. Melinda sits up, comforting him. Her\n              eyes are drawn to the corner.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Who is that man?\n\n              Coffey is struggling to rise. Brutal does his best to help.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        John? Can you turn around? Can you\n                        turn around and see this lady?\n\n              Coffey turns. His face is ashen gray, seriously ill.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        What's your name?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        John Coffey, ma'am.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        Like the drink, only not spelled\n                        the same.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        No, ma'am. Not spelt the same at\n                        all.\n\n              She pushes the covers aside to rise. Hal tries to stop her...\n\n                                  HAL\n                        Melly, no...\n\n              ...but she pushes his hand gently aside. Hal watches in\n              wonder as she stands, takes a first tentative step...and\n              walks to Coffey. She gazes up and touches his face.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        I dreamed of you. I dreamed you\n                        were wandering in the dark, and so\n                        was I. We found each other. We\n                        found each other in the dark.\n\n              She undoes her necklace, holds it up for him. He hesitates,\n              glances to Paul. Paul nods--it's all right. Coffey lowers his\n              head. Melinda affixes the delicate chain around his neck.\n\n                                  MELINDA\n                        It's St. Christopher. I want you\n                        to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear\n                        it. He'll keep you safe.

MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n              Paul and the men hustle Coffey out the front door toward the\n              truck, helping him as best they can. He's weak as a baby,\n              knees threatening to give out at any moment.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        C'mon, John, stay on your feet.\n\n                                  HARRY\n                        Christ, he goes down, we'll need\n                        three mules and a crane to pick\n                        him up again...\n\n              They get Coffey to the truck and throw their backs into it,\n              helping him crawl up onto the stakebed. He rolls over on his\n              back. Harry hops up, covers him with an old blanket. Brutal\n              pulls aside, speaking low:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        He'll never sit in Old Sparky.

Ready?\n\n              Coffey nods, sits heavily on the bunk. He lowers his head,\n              breath rasping like a rusted hinge. The guards step out.\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        What about Mrs. Moores? Was it\n                        like the mouse?

Percy\n              is revealed sitting against the wall, glaring, his mouth\n              still taped. Paul crouches down. Brutal joins him.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        I want to talk, not shout. I take\n                        the tape off, you gonna be calm.\n\n              Percy nods. Paul takes hold of the tape, preparing to yank.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        My mother always said if you do it\n                        fast, it won't hurt so much.\n\n              Paul rips the tape off.

He shrugs out of\n              the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes, trying to maintain\n              a shred of dignity.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        My things?\n\n              Dean hands them over. Percy smooths his hair and puts his hat\n              on, starts strapping on his holster belt.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Think it over, Percy.\n\n                                  PERCY\n                        Oh, I intend to.

Brutal whispers to Paul:\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        He'll talk. Sooner or later.\n\n              Paul nods with weary resignation--yeah, I know.\n\n              ON THE MILE\n\n              Percy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting\n              his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him\n              through the bars. His SCREAM brings Paul and the others from\n              the restraint room.\n\n              Coffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks\n              like he's trying to push his head through. He draws his lips\n              back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer...\n\n              Percy whacks him with his baton. Coffey barely seems to feel\n              it. He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head,\n              pulling him ever closer...\n\n              ...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come\n              together. Coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath\n              for hours. Percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get\n              away. The men jump in, try to pry Percy loose, hollering for\n              Coffey to let him go.\n\n              The black \"insects\" are flowing from Coffey to Percy,\n              swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat.\n\n              Several lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down\n              the Mile. Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and\n              clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again.\n\n              And then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's\n              tasted something bad. The color has returned to his skin.\n\n              Percy, however, is ashen gray. His expression is blank as a\n              sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes.\n\n              The men are stunned. Paul raises his hand to Percy's face,\n              snaps his fingers. Nothing. He tries again, clapping loudly.\n              Percy reacts slightly, eyes fluttering, swaying a bit.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Easy, easy. You all right?\n\n              Percy says nothing. He turns and walks slowly up the Mile,\n              his movements vacant and disjointed. He comes to a swaying\n              stop at Wild Bill's cell...and turns slowly to look in.\n\n              Wild Bill is coming painfully around, groggily clutching his\n              head. He looks up, see Percy.\n\n                                  BILLY\n                        What'a you looking at, you limp\n                        noodle? You wanna kiss my ass or\n                        suck my dick?\n\n              Nothing for the longest moment. Percy just staring...\n\n              ...and then he pulls his gun and empties it into Wild Bill as\n              fast as he can pull the trigger. BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!BAM!\n              Bill takes all six rounds in the chest, reeling back across\n              the cell. He hits the wall and slides down, leaving a smear,\n              his face registering a final look of stunned surprise.\n\n              Paul and the other tackle Percy and bring him down, wrestling\n              the gun out of his hand. Dean is almost weeping:\n\n                                  DEAN\n                        Oh God, oh God, no...\n\n              Percy is flat on his back, staring up at nothing. The black\n              \"bugs\" come drifting out of nose and mouth, swirling in the\n              air over his head. They turn white and disappear.\n\n              The men are speechless. Paul turns, sees Coffey sitting on\n              the floor at his bars, watching.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Punished them bad men.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Why Wild Bill? Why?\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I saw in his heart. When he grab\n                        my arm, I saw what Wild Billy\n                        done. Saw plain as day. Can't hide\n                        what's in your heart.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        What? Saw what?\n\n              Coffey reaches toward him, straining through the bars.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Take my hand, boss. You see for\n                        yourself.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                        Paul, no!\n\n              Paul hesitates, torn between reason and Coffey's pleading\n              eyes. A whisper:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        My hand.\n\n              Paul can't help it. He has to. Their hands come together.\n              Paul lurches wildly as that circuit starts blazing between\n              them...\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        No...please...\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Gots to, boss. Gots to give you a\n                        little bit of myself. A gift,\n                        like. A gift of what's in me so\n                        you can see...\n\n              ...and Paul sees:\n\n              The Detterick twins. Kathe and Cora. Laughing and playing\n              hopscotch in the dust under a later afternoon sun...\n\n              A dinner table. Family having supper late in the day, basket\n              of biscuits being passed. Twelve year old Howie Detterick\n              taking it, passing it on...\n\n              An hand with a paint brush slopping bright red paint on the\n              side of a barn...\n\n              Kathe skipping to the head of the hopscotch squares, turning\n              and starting back, laughing in the sun...\n\n              The paint brush slopping more paint, dripping like blood...\n\n              Paul jerks and twists, trying to pull away, trying to break\n              the circuit, but he can't, not till all is seen and done:\n\n              Marjorie Detterick calling from the porch for everybody to\n              come eat, supper's ready...\n\n              A hammer pausing. Klaus looking down from atop the barn...\n\n              The Detterick twins finishing their hopscotch, gathering\n              their jump ropes from the dust, running across the yard...\n\n              The basket of biscuits being passed to little Cora, who takes\n              a biscuit and passes it on...\n\n              Klaus coming down the ladder, calling to his daughters.

Coffey knows why they're here. He rises as\n              Brutal unlocks the cell, slides the door open.

They kneel to\n              apply the leg clamps, while Brutal and Harry secure the arms.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Wipe you face before you stand up,\n                        Dean.\n\n              Dean nods, wiping his face with the sleeve of his coat. They\n              rise, stepping back. This time, Paul's out front:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Roll on one.\n\n              Van Hay cranks the generator. The lights flare hotter and\n              brighter. It's just like in Melinda's bedroom the night\n              Coffey cured her with a kiss. Airless and bright, dreamlike.\n\n                                  MARJORIE\n                        Does it hurt yet?

Do you have anything to say\n                        before sentence is carried out?\n\n              John hesitates, nods.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        I'm sorry for what I am.\n\n                                  MARJORIE\n                        You ought to be! Oh, you monster,\n                        you damn well ought to be!\n\n              Brutal takes the mask from the hook to draw it over Coffey's\n              head. Coffey looks to Paul with terrified, pleading eyes.\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        Please, boss, don't put that thing\n                        over my face.

Coffey is breathing\n              fast, terrified, muttering under his breath:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                        ...heaven...I'm in heaven...\n                        heaven...heaven...heaven...\n\n              THE WITNESSES\n\n              sit and wait, barely breathing.\n\n              JACK VAN HAY\n\n              is poised at the switch, wondering why the order won't come.\n\n              PAUL\n\n              is staring at Coffey, unable to say the words.\n\n                                  BRUTAL\n                               (whispers)\n                        Paul. You have to say it. You have\n                        to give the order.\n\n              Paul can't. He reaches out and touches Coffey's hand. Their\n              fingers clasp. In that moment, staring into his eyes, Paul\n              hears the last thought that ever goes through Coffey's head:\n\n                                  COFFEY\n                               (whispered V.O.)\n                        He kill 'em with they love.

Paul steps back, eyes still locked\n              with Coffey's, and says the hardest words he's ever spoken:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Roll on two.\n\n              Van Hay throws the switch. Coffey surges forward, fingers\n              splayed and jittering past Old Sparky's arms.\n\n              Lights begin blowing out all over the Mile, raining shattered\n              glass and sparks. Some of the witnesses scream.\n\n              A thin line of blood comes trickling out of Klaus Detterick's\n              nose. He reaches up, absently wipes it away.\n\n              Coffey's eyes are locked on Paul's, riding the lightning all\n              the way. He finally slumps. Van Hay kills the current.\n\n              Coffey's expression is peaceful, as if sleeping. A final pair\n              of tears drift gently down his cheeks.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT\n\n              Paul ever so carefully replaces the St. Christopher's medal\n              around Coffey's neck. They wheel him down the tunnel.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n              INT.

He sits for a moment, then\n              gets out and heads for the house.\n\n              The door opens. Jan steps out in her nightgown and robe to\n              meet him on the stairs. She takes him in her arms.\n\n              Paul can't hold it back anymore. He breaks down sobbing\n              against her as we\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n              INT.

Just couldn't do it\n                        anymore after that. Brutal either.\n                        We both transferred out, took jobs\n                        with Boys' Correctional.\n                               (beat, nods)\n                        That was all right.

SHACK - DAY\n\n              We see Paul approach through the grimy window as before, this\n              time bringing Elaine. ANGLE SHIFTS to the door as they\n              arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them.\n\n              They enter. Elaine looks around at the musty nooks and\n              crannies, wondering what they're doing here. Paul touchers\n              arm, directs her attention:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        There.\n\n              Elaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards:\n\n              An old cigar box.\n\n              For a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up.\n\n              Elaine's breath catches in her throat...\n\n              ...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the\n              cigar box. It's a mouse. His fur, once brown, is now all gray.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Paul? It isn't...it can't be...\n\n              Paul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand.\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Come over here, boy. Come on over\n                        her and see this lady.\n\n              The mouse tries several times to get over the side of the\n              cigar box before he finally makes it. He comes to them,\n              hobbling and crippled with arthritis. Paul pulls a slice of\n              toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        That can't be Mr. Jingles.\n\n              Paul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. Mr.\n              Jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. He gets\n              ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. Softly:\n\n                                  PAUL\n                        Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue\n                        au cirque du mousie.\n\n              Paul tosses the spool. The mouse limps painfully after it. He\n              reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his\n              breath. Elaine starts forward, but Paul holds her back.\n\n              After a moment, Mr. Jingles finds his feet again. He rises\n              and starts nosing the spool back to Paul.\n\n                                  ELAINE\n                        Oh, Paul. Don't make him do it\n                        again.
