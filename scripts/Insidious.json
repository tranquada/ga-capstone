DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...\r\n          white like the moon.\r\n                         \r\n          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.\r\n                         \r\n          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --\r\n          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white\r\n          ceiling. The bulb unlit.\r\n                         \r\n          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -\r\n          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.\r\n                         \r\n          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket\r\n          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His\r\n          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.\r\n                         \r\n          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.\r\n                         \r\n          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with\r\n          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

And without\r\n          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.\r\n                         \r\n          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.\r\n                         \r\n          Someone is standing in front of it.\r\n                         \r\n          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away.

Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.\r\n                         \r\n          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His\r\n          heaving snores have woken her up.\r\n                         \r\n          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet\r\n          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,\r\n          but the lines of age are creeping in.\r\n                         \r\n          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair\r\n          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.\r\n                         \r\n          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He\r\n          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.\r\n                         \r\n          She climbs out of bed.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living\r\n          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with\r\n          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.\r\n                         \r\n          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a\r\n          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of\r\n          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books\r\n          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.\r\n                         \r\n          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles\r\n          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A\r\n          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.\r\n                         \r\n          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away\r\n          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.\r\n                         \r\n          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The\r\n          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.\r\n                         \r\n           VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Mom?\r\n                         \r\n          She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her\r\n          son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy\r\n          we saw in the opening scene.)\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           What are you doing up, kiddo?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           I don't like my room.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           You'll get used to it. It's only\r\n           your first night.\r\n                         \r\n          He climbs into her lap. She bites on his ear playfully.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI (CONT'D)\r\n           Argh, I'm going to eat you.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           What are you looking at?\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Just some photos.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           What photos?\r\n                         \r\n          She hefts another album from the box, prying it open. A photo\r\n          of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Do you know who that is?\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           No.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           That's me.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           It doesn't look like you.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           I know. I'm so happy there. But\r\n           it's me. When I was your age. I was\r\n           a kid once too, you know.\r\n                         \r\n                          DALTON\r\n           No, you weren't.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai bursts out laughing. She is famous for her big laugh.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't\r\n           remember being this person at all.\r\n           I hope she smiled like that all the\r\n           time, whoever she was.\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          She sizes up her son.

Sometimes I wanna keep\r\n           him on one of those child leashes.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Why bother with a child leash? I'll\r\n           stop at the pet store tomorrow.\r\n           18.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          She laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           I'm sorry I was pissy when you got\r\n           home. I was trying to work on a\r\n           song today and then Cali woke up\r\n           and wouldn't stop crying...\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           I didn't even notice.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           I feel guilty for wanting my own\r\n           time.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           It's normal to want your own time.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Is it? My mother gave up everything\r\n           for me. I keep waiting for the\r\n           completely selfless parent gene to\r\n           kick in, but I'm exactly the same\r\n           person I was when I was 22, only\r\n           now I'm married with kids.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           You're a great mother.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           No, I'm not. They like you so much\r\n           better than me.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           That's not true.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           You're the cool dad who comes home\r\n           with presents and I'm the one who\r\n           yells at them all day.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Now you're being crazy. They love\r\n           you. At least you get to connect\r\n           with them. I work so much.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Believe me, you're their hero. They\r\n           try to play us off against each\r\n           other. They're master manipulators.\r\n           I guess they really are my kids.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh laughs. A lull settles over them.\r\n           19.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI (CONT'D)\r\n           Is this it, Josh?\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Is this so bad?\r\n                         \r\n          She doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Thank you for letting me take some time\r\n           off to work on my music again.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           We'll get by.

And I think, maybe I\r\n           could do something with them.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           I love all your songs.\r\n                         \r\n          They kiss.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Josh charges in, bits of\r\n          tissue on his face from shaving cuts. Cali flails her arms in\r\n          her high chair.

Come on.\r\n                         \r\n          Nothing from Dalton. He doesn't even stir. Josh rolls his\r\n          eyes and walks in. Nudges Dalton with his knee.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH (CONT'D)\r\n           You're making me look bad here.\r\n           Outta bed before your mother comes\r\n           in and kills both of us.\r\n           21.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Nothing.

JOEL SERCARZ (46).\r\n                         \r\n          Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. They are red with tears.\r\n          Beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an ICU\r\n          chamber, is the unconscious body of Dalton.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. SERCARZ\r\n           Okay...as of yet, our tests have\r\n           not drawn any conclusive answers\r\n           for you. Repeated blood and CSF\r\n           cultures are normal, making an\r\n           infective origin highly unlikely.\r\n           Tests for Lyme disease and repeated\r\n           polymerase chain reaction are\r\n           negative. Systemic vasculitis was\r\n           ruled out. Dalton remains in an\r\n           areactive coma without focal signs\r\n           or abnormal brainstem reflexes.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold, multi-syllable\r\n          medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with\r\n          a foreign language.\r\n                         \r\n           DR.

SERCARZ (CONT'D)\r\n           I wouldn't say we've exhausted\r\n           every single angle...but we're\r\n           close. The underlying cause is\r\n           still unknown.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh and Renai look in at their boy.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)\r\n           The good news is that he's\r\n           breathing without the use of a\r\n           mechanical apparatus, and there are\r\n           no lesions or hemorrhages in any of\r\n           the CT scans.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           So...there's no brain damage or...?\r\n                         \r\n           DR. SERCARZ\r\n           None that we've detected. Technically,\r\n           he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to\r\n           stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but\r\n           there's no brain trauma or infection. His\r\n           scans are normal. To be honest, I've\r\n           never seen anything like it.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           That fall he took...I mean, it looked\r\n           like he hit his head pretty hard.\r\n                         \r\n           DR. SERCARZ\r\n           We definitely exhausted that\r\n           possibility, but it was always\r\n           doubtful. The cut was superficial,\r\n           there wasn't even a skull fracture.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           He can't just not wake up...there's\r\n           got to be something...\r\n                         \r\n          Renai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a\r\n          deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb.\r\n                         \r\n          Sercarz clears his throat.

IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube\r\n          into his mouth.\r\n                         \r\n          A young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes\r\n          as Renai watches on.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADELE\r\n           Are you having any more trouble\r\n           with the feeding tube?\r\n                         \r\n          Renai looks broken, the life drained from her.

Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur.\r\n                         \r\n          It is coming from the baby monitor.\r\n                         \r\n          Confused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume\r\n          all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room.\r\n                         \r\n          She presses her ear to the device, then hears it again - a\r\n          hushed WHISPER, almost indistinct from the static save for\r\n          the whistle of sibilants.\r\n           25.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          VOICE\r\n                          (FROM MONITOR)\r\n           They see us...all of us...we have to be\r\n           quick...this life begs us to come back.\r\n                         \r\n          The whisper trails off....more static...\r\n                         \r\n                          VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n                          (FROM MONITOR)\r\n           NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Renai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the\r\n          sound of the scream. Nerves fried.\r\n                         \r\n          The monitor smashes on the floor. All is quiet.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the\r\n          door to Cali's nursery.\r\n                         \r\n          It is open only a crack.

Smoking a cigarette.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           What are you doing up?\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           It's midnight, Josh.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           When did you start smoking?\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           You've been coming home late every\r\n           single night.

I feel it\r\n           every time you mention our bills.\r\n           That subtle voice that says `can't\r\n           you get a job that pays more than a\r\n           teacher'? And now I can't even look\r\n           at you without feeling it.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           You're projecting that onto me.\r\n           You've written an entire story\r\n           about I'm how I'm feeling without\r\n           once asking me how I'm feeling.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           I don't need to ask.

I mean you're\r\n           not here. With me. In this\r\n           situation. You're avoiding it, like\r\n           you do anything stressful, whether\r\n           it's this or a parking ticket.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Christ, I should have stayed at the\r\n           school.\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           There you go again.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai stands up and walks inside the house.

He curls up on it, pulling a blanket over himself.\r\n           37.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Dalton is as still as we've seen him. And then...he twitches.\r\n          A slight facial twitch, but we see it.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Josh snoozes, head arched at a bad angle. His back will\r\n          regret sleeping on this couch.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Bad dreams.\r\n                         \r\n          She blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone,\r\n          sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back\r\n          onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window.\r\n                         \r\n          There is a man standing outside it.\r\n                         \r\n          He is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth,\r\n          furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and\r\n          forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey\r\n          jacket.\r\n                         \r\n          Every muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier.\r\n                         \r\n          Her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer\r\n          will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door.\r\n          Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally--\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...\r\n                         \r\n          She glances back at the window.\r\n                         \r\n          THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM.\r\n                         \r\n          He paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just\r\n          as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend.\r\n                         \r\n          And then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at\r\n          Renai - as if just realizing she was there.\r\n           38.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          For a moment their eyes are locked in silence...\r\n                         \r\n          ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES\r\n          towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAN\r\n           DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!\r\n                         \r\n          Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A\r\n          cry from the depths of her soul.\r\n                         \r\n          She propels herself backward, falling off the bed and\r\n          scrambling back into the corner.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light--\r\n                         \r\n          --seeing only Renai, huddled in the corner, screaming.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           What is it? What is it?!\r\n                         \r\n          Renai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs\r\n          her by the shoulders.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH (CONT'D)\r\n           Renai, what is wrong?!\r\n                         \r\n                          RENAI\r\n           The man -- he was there -- he tried\r\n           to -- there was a man there!!!\r\n                         \r\n          Foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his\r\n          mother and instantly begins crying.

Standing next to the grandfather clock,\r\n          dressed in Amish garb.

Please...\r\n                         \r\n          For a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing.\r\n                         \r\n          Then...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see.\r\n                         \r\n          Dalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This\r\n          movement is followed by something that is hard to miss--\r\n                         \r\n          One of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall\r\n          begins to wind loose.\r\n                         \r\n          It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of\r\n          popcorn...followed by another tack.\r\n                         \r\n          The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,\r\n          examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on\r\n          the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks\r\n          works themselves free, popping out of the wall.\r\n                         \r\n          The drawing floats down to the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh stoops down, picking it up.\r\n                         \r\n          It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a\r\n          self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from\r\n          above.\r\n                         \r\n          The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars\r\n          and bloated planets.\r\n                         \r\n          Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,\r\n          flying above the house with another man.\r\n                         \r\n          At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last\r\n          night I watched myself sleep'.\r\n                         \r\n          A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and\r\n          painful tears he has long pent up.\r\n                         \r\n          Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'\r\n           68.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Renai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Renai shuffles into the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's\r\n          drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Okay.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Specs opens\r\n          up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil.\r\n                         \r\n          A small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's\r\n          bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh\r\n          and Renai.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELISE\r\n           What's most important is that you\r\n           realize no two attempts are the\r\n           same. I will be completely honest\r\n           with you about the results, and if\r\n           no dialogue is established, I will\r\n           tell you. I am not in the business\r\n           of embellishing success. What\r\n           happens, happens.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELISE (CONT'D)\r\n           Forget the limits and laws and logic\r\n           of this world. We are treading in a\r\n           different place now.\r\n                         \r\n          Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner,\r\n          holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA.\r\n           69.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          TUCKER\r\n           These still cameras are rigged to\r\n           pick up changes in the atmosphere,\r\n           electrical or temperature-wise.

Steven\r\n           will write it down and repeat it\r\n           for you.\r\n                         \r\n          Specs waits obediently at her side.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELISE (CONT'D)\r\n           Hold on to each other, and stay\r\n           focused. You'll see things you\r\n           don't understand. Confusing things.\r\n           Do not question them or speak in\r\n           any way.\r\n                         \r\n          She turns to Specs.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELISE (CONT'D)\r\n           Dim the lights please.\r\n                         \r\n          Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level.\r\n                         \r\n          Elise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head,\r\n          as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders.\r\n                         \r\n          One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room\r\n          in white light for a split second.\r\n                         \r\n          Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is\r\n          very still.\r\n                         \r\n          Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking\r\n          device made from GREY CLOTH.\r\n                         \r\n          It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone\r\n          shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of\r\n          the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling\r\n          outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early\r\n          version of a microphone.\r\n                         \r\n          Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the\r\n          device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to\r\n          her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.\r\n                         \r\n          Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus\r\n          around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.\r\n           70.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's\r\n          facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand.\r\n                         \r\n          Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.\r\n                         \r\n          Then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It\r\n          is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in\r\n          cursive.\r\n                         \r\n          we are calling out to you dalton\r\n          Renai grips Josh's hand tightly.\r\n                         \r\n                          SPECS\r\n           We are calling out to you Dalton.\r\n                         \r\n           tell us that you are safe tell us where you are\r\n                          SPECS (CONT'D)\r\n           Tell us that you are safe.

He writes.\r\n           who's there?\r\n                          SPECS (CONT'D)\r\n           Who's there?\r\n           it is your mother and father we have been\r\n          looking for you\r\n                          SPECS (CONT'D)\r\n           It is your mother and father.

The paper is yellowing. Faded. Soaked from the rain.\r\n                         \r\n          Lorraine hands the packet to Josh, who is dumbfounded.\r\n                         \r\n          Renai peers over Josh's shoulder, at a Polaroid of a boy,\r\n          about nine years old, sitting on a couch. Early 70s period.\r\n                         \r\n          It is a Young Josh. Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A\r\n          FIGURE.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh runs his finger over the shadow. His heart rate speeds\r\n          up. An old memory is coming back to him.\r\n                         \r\n                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)\r\n           At first, I thought it was a camera\r\n           problem. Then I saw her again.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of\r\n          Josh as a youngster. This time he stands in an old kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          Once again, there is a figure behind him - clearer this time,\r\n          but still hidden in silhouette. A step closer to Josh.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh flips to the next picture. A BLACK AND WHITE shot of\r\n          himself as a young boy, lying in bed.\r\n           80.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          With dread, Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD\r\n          WOMAN, crouching beside his bed.

THE FURTHER - NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks down at his feet.\r\n                         \r\n          He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He\r\n          concentrates with fierce intensity--\r\n                         \r\n          --and then watches as his feet touch the ground.\r\n           85.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He is walking.\r\n                         \r\n          He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Dalton?\r\n                         \r\n          The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were\r\n          inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or\r\n          angles for it to bounce off.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH (CONT'D)\r\n           Dalton? Where are you?\r\n                         \r\n          For a long time, there is nothing...\r\n                         \r\n          ...\r\n                         \r\n          ...then he sees it.\r\n                         \r\n          A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner\r\n          with his back to Josh.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh moves towards the figure.\r\n                         \r\n          Closer. Closer.\r\n                         \r\n          The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there.\r\n                         \r\n          He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in\r\n          the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and\r\n          stares...\r\n                         \r\n          ...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks to his right and sees--\r\n                         \r\n          --A SHADOW.\r\n                         \r\n          Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle\r\n          light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and\r\n          disappears.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh walks towards the front door of the house. He reaches it\r\n          and turns the handle.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          A long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is\r\n          dark here.\r\n           86.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Josh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right\r\n          into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life.\r\n                         \r\n          The colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and\r\n          BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh keeps moving down the corridor.\r\n                         \r\n          Up ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall,\r\n          ignoring Josh.\r\n                         \r\n          He presses forward, following the figure.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Dalton?\r\n                         \r\n          He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table.\r\n                         \r\n          His footsteps have no sound as he continues on.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH (CONT'D)\r\n           Dalton?\r\n                         \r\n          He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage.\r\n                         \r\n          A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a\r\n          child being punished at school.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Where is Dalton?\r\n                         \r\n          He steps closer yet again.\r\n                         \r\n          His hand reaches out to touch the figures back...\r\n                         \r\n          ...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder.\r\n                         \r\n          Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the\r\n          source.\r\n                         \r\n          When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE.\r\n                         \r\n          He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the\r\n          DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of\r\n          the room.\r\n           87.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish,\r\n          dream-like.\r\n                         \r\n          Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left.\r\n                         \r\n          SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN.\r\n                         \r\n          The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His\r\n          neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems\r\n          stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Do you know where Dalton is?\r\n                         \r\n          The man doesn't acknowledge him.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAN\r\n           Why do I have to put up with you?\r\n           What a tramp. You call this a home?\r\n           I work all day for this?\r\n                         \r\n          He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs.\r\n          The stairs descend into darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh squints into the dark, afraid.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Dalton? Where are you?\r\n                         \r\n          The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to\r\n          walk away. A distant voice stops him.\r\n                         \r\n           DALTON (O.S.)\r\n           Dad...\r\n                         \r\n          Josh SNAPS back.\r\n                         \r\n          The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of\r\n          the stairs.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell.\r\n                         \r\n          Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another\r\n          corridor of this labyrinth.\r\n           88.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An\r\n          alternate world version of it.\r\n                         \r\n          The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs\r\n          of life. Water drips somewhere.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room.\r\n                         \r\n          There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle\r\n          aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in\r\n          place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life.\r\n                         \r\n          The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an\r\n          arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor.\r\n                         \r\n          The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver'\r\n          tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh steps closer to the mother...\r\n                         \r\n          ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her\r\n          body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing\r\n          statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes,\r\n          struggling to hold the newspaper in place.\r\n                         \r\n          He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a\r\n          window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the\r\n          street below.\r\n                         \r\n          A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS\r\n                         \r\n          Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered\r\n          door is adjacent to the kitchen.\r\n                         \r\n          The door is ajar.\r\n                         \r\n          Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his\r\n          finger.\r\n                         \r\n          It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A\r\n          YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the\r\n          others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause.\r\n           89.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          He is having more trouble than the family, trembling\r\n          slightly.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           I'm looking for my son, Dalton.\r\n                         \r\n          The boy does not look up. Does not move.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in\r\n          the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet\r\n          but no water comes forth.\r\n                         \r\n          When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his\r\n          bedroom.\r\n                         \r\n          Josh glances back at the living room.\r\n                         \r\n          The Young Man is now standing inside the living room.\r\n                         \r\n          Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his\r\n          family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in\r\n          BLOOD.\r\n                         \r\n          Each of them has a bullet hole in their head.\r\n                         \r\n          Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the\r\n          mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest.\r\n                         \r\n          She blinks...still playing dead.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

I'm right behind you!\r\n                         \r\n          Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH (CONT'D)\r\n           You...what do you want from me?\r\n                         \r\n          He approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman,\r\n          past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on\r\n          the other side in--\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is\r\n          now in The Further, and she is in our world.\r\n                         \r\n                          JOSH\r\n           Get away the fuck away from me.
