On\n    his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his\n    mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as\n    he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS\n    fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest\n    salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;\n    among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he\n    enters, all kneel.\n\n    His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,\n    heads bowed before him.

The\n    Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.\n    Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns\n    of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's\n    power.\n\n    Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the\n    crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's\n    eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his\n    people's adoration.\n\n\n    EXT.

Nearby on a blood-stained bench\n     lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably.\n     It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor\n     guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary.\n\n     Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet.\n     Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking\n     his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.\n\n                         WALSINGHAM\n               Still nothing to tell me, Mr\n               Throckmorton?\n\n     Throckmorton struggles to lift his head.\n                          T\n                          HROCKMORTON\n               My soul will go free soon.\n\n                         WALSINGHAM\n               I know about the Enterprise.
