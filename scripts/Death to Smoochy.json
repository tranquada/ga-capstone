Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --\nskates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few\nRhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful\nfairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the\nrafters and takes Smoochy's hand.

A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one\nnotices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward\nthe \"gates of heaven\" with the angel Moochy. Giant white\ngates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating\nangels open their arms to welcome Moochy.\n\n\nOUTER RINK\n\nRandolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get\nSheldon's attention.

In\nSLOW MOTION, Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the\nair and lands softly on the ice.\n\n\nWIDE\n\nEveryone in the arena screams and heads for the exits.\nIt's pandemonium.

Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to\nbring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the\nrink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the\ncatwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.\n\n\nCLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS\n\nHis knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from\nthe beam.\n\n\nANGLE ON BUGGY\n\nStill clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his\ngrip.
