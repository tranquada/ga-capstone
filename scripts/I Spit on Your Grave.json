CITY STREET - DAY \r\n</b>\r\n          JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling\r\n          along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't\r\n          hide her natural beauty and panache.\r\n          She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens\r\n          the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other\r\n          bags.\r\n\r\n          She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that\r\n          the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and\r\n          personal affects.\r\n\r\n          Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al\r\n\r\n          Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment\r\n          to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her\r\n          mind.\r\n\r\n          After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks\r\n          at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and\r\n          then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.\r\n          B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl\r\n          The SUV drives off down the city street.\r\n\r\n<b>          C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 \r\n</b>\r\n          The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in\r\n          the background, growing more distant by the second.\r\n\r\n<b>          2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 \r\n</b>\r\n          The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through\r\n          a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and\r\n          absolutely breathtaking.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GPS SYSTEM\r\n</b>          Turn right up ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are\r\n          all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2.\r\n</b>\r\n          Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.\r\n          She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks\r\n          the address on the house, and gets out of the car.\r\n\r\n<b>          3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3\r\n</b>\r\n          Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the\r\n          screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.\r\n          The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JENNIFER\r\n</b>          Hello?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer cautiously steps inside.\r\n\r\n<b>          4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4\r\n</b>\r\n          The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds\r\n          hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.\r\n          Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in\r\n          various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube\r\n          TVs with their plastic casings cracked.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JENNIFER\r\n</b>          Hello?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Hello?\r\n\r\n<b>          EARL (O.S.)\r\n</b>          I'm a coming, I'm a coming.\r\n\r\n          From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),\r\n          takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing\r\n          he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the\r\n          middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to\r\n          pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.\r\n\r\n<b>                         EARL (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Sorry about the mess.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JENNIFER\r\n</b>          It's fine, really.

RURAL ROAD - DAY 5\r\n</b>\r\n          Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by\r\n          two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.\r\n          Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a\r\n          single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 \r\n</b>\r\n          Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map\r\n          as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the\r\n          pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer spins around. \r\n\r\n          Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from\r\n          Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JOHNNY\r\n</b>          Didn't mean to frighten you.\r\n\r\n          Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way.

Just as Jennifer opens her\r\n          mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the\r\n          silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.\r\n\r\n          In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the\r\n          fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his\r\n          lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that\r\n          look like they could bend steel.\r\n\r\n          STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind\r\n          Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of\r\n          pork rinds.\r\n\r\n<b>                         STANLEY \r\n</b>          Howdy ma'am. \r\n\r\n          He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. \r\n\r\n<b>                         ANDY\r\n</b>          I'd sop that up with a biscuit real\r\n          good.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,\r\n          who is still awaiting her answer.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JENNIFER\r\n</b>          Uh... no. I mean yes.\r\n\r\n          As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.\r\n          She is definitely something to look at.\r\n\r\n          Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to\r\n          the guys, then back to her.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JOHNNY\r\n</b>          You know, you're running a little\r\n          hot.

It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.\r\n          Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed.

A \"writer's zone\" where everything she types is gold.\r\n          She hits the \"return\" key hard, as if to punctuate a\r\n          particularly good sentence.

She picks the phone up, flips it\r\n          open - It's still completely dead.\r\n          In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It\r\n          hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles\r\n          mischievously to herself.\r\n          Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled\r\n          with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a\r\n          joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.\r\n\r\n<b>          24 EXT.

Satisfied, she walks out\r\n          onto the front porch, then down the steps.

She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table\r\n          next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse\r\n          on the couch.\r\n\r\n<b>          30 INT.

A branch\r\n          from outside scrapes against the windowsill.\r\n          Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief.

She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her\r\n          uneasiness is growing. Suddenly...

He tickles Jennifer's\r\n          bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,\r\n          past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping\r\n          at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -\r\n          her pants drop to the floor.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JOHNNY\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (TO MATTHEW)\r\n</b>          Do it now.

A few seconds later, he's in his\r\n          boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.\r\n          Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall.

Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny\r\n          yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of\r\n          them as she desperately tries to fight him off.\r\n\r\n<b>          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Get her legs!\r\n          Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above\r\n          her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.\r\n          Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman\r\n          SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.\r\n          ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in\r\n          and out of focus.\r\n          Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS.

For some reason, the anger\r\n          allows him to perform.\r\n          Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to\r\n          her brain is cut off, Matthew stops.
