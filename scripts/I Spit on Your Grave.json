CITY STREET - DAY \r\n\r\n          JENNIFER HILLS races down from a stoop, a suitcase rolling\r\n          along behind her. Even dressed down, this city girl can't\r\n          hide her natural beauty and panache.\r\n          She makes her way across the street and to an SUV. she opens\r\n          the trunk and tosses in the suitcase among several other\r\n          bags.\r\n\r\n          She closes it, and walks to the driver's side. We see that\r\n          the entire cargo bay of the SUV is filled with boxes and\r\n          personal affects.\r\n\r\n          Al INT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Al\r\n\r\n          Jennifer gets in and slams the door shut. she takes a moment\r\n          to think, to breathe. Something is weighing heavily on her\r\n          mind.\r\n\r\n          After a beat, she glances up to the rearview mirror and looks\r\n          at herself. She take a long, deep, cleansing breath, and\r\n          then she turns the key in the ignition and starts the car.\r\n          B1 EXT. SUV, CITY STREET - DAY Bl\r\n          The SUV drives off down the city street.\r\n\r\n          C1 EXT. CITY OVERPASS - DAY C1 \r\n\r\n          The SUV carves its way through traffic as the city looms in\r\n          the background, growing more distant by the second.\r\n\r\n          2 INT. CAR, RURAL ROAD - DAY 2 \r\n\r\n          The midday sun bakes the landscape as Jennifer drives through\r\n          a country road. A stark contrast from the city, and\r\n          absolutely breathtaking.\r\n\r\n                         GPS SYSTEM\r\n          Turn right up ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n          Jennifer squints out the front windshield. The streets are\r\n          all unpaved and none of them are marked with street signs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 2.\r\n\r\n          Finally, Jennifer pulls into the driveway of a small house.\r\n          She picks up a piece of paper from the passenger seat, checks\r\n          the address on the house, and gets out of the car.\r\n\r\n          3 EXT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 3\r\n\r\n          Jennifer walks up the crumbling steps of the house. On the\r\n          screen door, a wire holds a wooden sign that reads; OPEN.\r\n          The screen door SQUEAKS loudly as Jennifer pulls it open.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer cautiously steps inside.\r\n\r\n          4 INT. EARL'S PLACE - DAY 4\r\n\r\n          The sunlight shines through the dirty curtains. Dust clouds\r\n          hang motionless in the air, as if suspended in a solution.\r\n          Scattered across the floor are a variety of electronics in\r\n          various stages of disrepair. A handful of old, picture tube\r\n          TVs with their plastic casings cracked.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer walks in further, trying to not step on anything.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n          EARL (O.S.)\r\n          I'm a coming, I'm a coming.\r\n\r\n          From out of the back walks the proprietor, EARL (late-50's),\r\n          takes a double take at Jennifer, surely the prettiest thing\r\n          he's seen in a long while. He sees her standing in the\r\n          middle of the mess, suddenly aware of it. He bends down to\r\n          pick something up in a futile attempt to clean.\r\n\r\n                         EARL (CONT'D)\r\n          Sorry about the mess.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          It's fine, really. I'm Jennifer\r\n          Hills. We spoke last week.\r\n\r\n                         (NO RECOGNITION)\r\n          I'm the one who's renting the cabin\r\n          on...\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 3.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          (Jennifer holds a piece of paper)\r\n          .on Mockingbird Trail.\r\n\r\n          Earl's surprised.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Oh, you're Miss Hills.\r\n\r\n          Earl walks over to a cabinet against the wall, opens a small\r\n          drawer and takes out a key.\r\n\r\n                         EARL (CONT'D)\r\n          Don't suppose you know how to get\r\n          out there?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Afraid not.\r\n\r\n          Earl hands her the key. Earl pulls a map with some hand-drawn\r\n          arrows already on it.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Alright, listen up 'cause it's a bit\r\n          tricky.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          These here arrows will get you\r\n          through town. Over here, it's more\r\n          dirt road and woods so it can get\r\n          kind of dicey. We're a tad short\r\n          on street signs.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Well if I get lost I'll just ask\r\n          for directions.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          To who?

The security deposit...\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          No, no. I'm looking forward to the\r\n          peace and quiet. I'm a novelist.\r\n          I'm starting my next book.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4.\r\n          Earl just looks at her.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Alright, well, if that's what\r\n          you're aimin' for, just follow that\r\n          there map.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer looks at the map.\r\n\r\n          5 EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY 5\r\n\r\n          Jennifer drives down the two lane road, barely passable by\r\n          two cars. She swerves as she glances down at map.\r\n          Then, up ahead she spots a small SERVICE STATION with a\r\n          single gas pump. She pulls up to the pump.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 6 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer gets out of the car and fumbles to fold back the map\r\n          as she twists the knob off her gas tank and reaches for the\r\n          pump. A HAND comes down on top of her own.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer spins around. \r\n\r\n          Standing there, smiling, is JOHNNY. He takes the pump from\r\n          Jennifer and inserts it into her gas tank.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Didn't mean to frighten you.\r\n\r\n          Johnny is good-looking in a rugged sort of way. He's sinewy,\r\n          but athletic and strong. Jennifer regains her composure.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          No, it's fine. I'm sort of lost\r\n          anyway. Looking for Mockingbird\r\n          Trail?\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You are definitely lost. \r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Really? I thought--\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Nah, you sure missed it. It's a \r\n          good ten miles back, left turn \r\n          after the big red mailbox.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 4A.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Oh, okay, I think I saw that.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5.\r\n          Johnny flashes his smile, picking his teeth with a toothpick.\r\n          Jennifer stands there uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You, uh... staying at the cabin?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer hesitates for a second. Just as Jennifer opens her\r\n          mouth to respond, the shrill notes of a HARMONICA shatter the\r\n          silence. Jennifer turns quickly to the garage.\r\n\r\n          In the garage, ANDY, one of Johnny's employees, sits on the\r\n          fender of a broken down car. He holds a harmonica to his\r\n          lips. He's in his mid-30's with shaggy hair and arms that\r\n          look like they could bend steel.\r\n\r\n          STANLEY, one of Johnny and Andy's buddies, walks up behind\r\n          Andy. He's balding and overweight, and digs into a bag of\r\n          pork rinds.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY \r\n          Howdy ma'am. \r\n\r\n          He leans into Andy who continues playing his harp. \r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          I'd sop that up with a biscuit real\r\n          good.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer turns away from the garage and looks back at Johnny,\r\n          who is still awaiting her answer.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Uh... no. I mean yes.\r\n\r\n          As she glances to the gas pump, Johnny looks her up and down.\r\n          She is definitely something to look at.\r\n\r\n          Johnny places his hand on the hood of the car. Glances to\r\n          the guys, then back to her.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You know, you're running a little\r\n          hot. Want me to uh... maybe I\r\n          should check under your hood?\r\n\r\n          Jennifer almost laughs at the way that sounded.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          How's that line working for you?\r\n\r\n          The gas pump clicks off interrupting. But Johnny just stands\r\n          there looking at her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 5A.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          I don't know, how's it working for\r\n          you?\r\n\r\n          Johnny saunters over to the pump and in a phallic manner,\r\n          pulls the pump out. It gets laughs from the peanut gallery.\r\n          Jennifer looks away, a line has been crossed. She looks to\r\n          the pump again. $19.78.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Let me just...\r\n\r\n          Jennifer fumbles into her purse when the map falls from her\r\n          hands.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          I'll get that.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          No I got it--\r\n\r\n          Johnny gets uncomfortably close to Jennifer at the rear door\r\n          of the car when--\r\n          HONK -- HONK -- HONK - The SUV's deafening alarm blares out.\r\n          Johnny's startled, stumbles backwards, trips and goes\r\n          sprawling to the ground.\r\n\r\n          Jennifer, controlling laughter, holds up her keys and clicks\r\n          the alarm off.\r\n\r\n          Johnny is covered in dust and oil, struggling to get to his\r\n          feet while maintaining a shred of dignity. Jennifer\r\n          chuckles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Sorry. I accidentally hit the\r\n          panic button. Are you okay?\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          I'm fine.\r\n\r\n          Johnny looks away, angry. He's certainly not the type of guy\r\n          who can laugh at himself easily, if at all. From the garage,\r\n          Stanley and Andy point at him and guffaw.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          (from the garage)\r\n          Hey! You better check your\r\n          underwear, Johnny.\r\n\r\n          Stanley smiles and elbows Andy, but his mouth is too full\r\n          with pork rinds to actually laugh.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Yea... Check um' for skidmarks...\r\n          Johnny shoots him a harsh look. \r\n\r\n          Jennifer hands Johnny a twenty. Trying to contain her\r\n          laughter.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 6A.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Sure you okay?\r\n\r\n          Johnny's eyes are cold, his face red.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 7.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          I said I was fine.\r\n\r\n          Suddenly, Jennifer grows uneasy. She smiles uncomfortably,\r\n          gets in the car and drives away.\r\n\r\n          Johnny takes a bandana from his pocket and wipes his brow.\r\n          He watches Jennifer's car disappear and spits on the ground\r\n          as the laughter escalates in her absence. Johnny spins.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          What the hell are you two dipshits\r\n          laughing at?!\r\n\r\n          7 EXT. CABIN - DAY 7\r\n\r\n          Jennifer arrives at the cabin. She gets out of her car and\r\n          stands there, looking up at it. In slight disrepair and in\r\n          need of a paint job but the quaint charm makes you quickly\r\n          forget its shortcomings.\r\n\r\n          8 TNT. CABIN - DAY 8 \r\n\r\n           Jennifer walks in with her bags, looks around the cabin.\r\n           It's rustic, but she's hardly roughing it.\r\n\r\n          9 INT. CABIN, THE KITCHEN - DAY 9 \r\n\r\n           She starts unpacking. A few cardboard boxes with non-\r\n          perishable food items sit on the counter next to cases of\r\n          bottled water. Also, there's a large wine case with\r\n          different liquor bottles in the sections. Jennifer takes out\r\n          a bottle of top shelf vodka and puts it in the freezer.\r\n          Then she begins to grab the wine bottles, taking an extra\r\n          second to look at one, the hell with it, she grabs an opener.\r\n\r\n          A9 TNT. CABIN - DAY A9 \r\n          Jennifer sets up her laptop at a make-shift workstation.\r\n          Throws some freshly cut flowers in a small vase, a few lucky\r\n          figurines from her travels... it all feels very ritualistic.\r\n\r\n          10 EXT. CABIN - DAY 10 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer site at the end of the boat dock. Laptop and glass\r\n          of wine writing away. She couldn't be more content.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8.\r\n          She takes a deep, replenishing breath, and then goes back to\r\n\r\n                         WRITING--\r\n\r\n          A10 INT. CABIN - DAY A10\r\n\r\n          CLOSE ON: Words fly across the screen as Jennifer types at a\r\n          furious pace. Blocks of text keep scrolling away.\r\n          Her fingers effortlessly swipe away at key after key, a\r\n          writer's high if you will.\r\n          Finally an exclamation point is stabbed with emphasis. Then \r\n          she hears a sound off in the trees. \r\n          She looks out and hears a very distant few notes of a \r\n          harmonica. Then a few even more distant \"heeeeeeweeeee\". \r\n          After a beat she innocently smiles figuring it's just some \r\n          boys off in the distance having a party or something. \r\n          Jennifer leans back, smiles briefly and pour herself a glass\r\n          of wine.\r\n\r\n          11 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH - DUSK 11 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer sits at the table, her laptop propped open in front\r\n          of her. She's talking away on the phone as she stops for a\r\n          moment to take a sip from a glass of red wine.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          .Lonely? Are you kidding? I\r\n          should've come out here on my first\r\n          book...\r\n          The wind kicks up and a in the distance a door is slammed\r\n          shut. It startles jennifer. She looks in the direction of the\r\n          sound.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Sorry, something just...\r\n          Another slam, and again.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          Barb, hold on a minute...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 8A.\r\n          Jennifer sets down her lap top and puts the glass of wine on\r\n          the arm of the chair. She gets up and looks off into the\r\n          dusky woods. Then back to the house.\r\n          A light breeze kicks up and SLAM. Again.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          Let me call you back.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 9.\r\n          Jennifer snaps the phone shut, and walks down the steps of\r\n          the front porch.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Hello?\r\n          In response, she gets the frantic CHIRPING of crickets as\r\n          night encroaches.\r\n          Jennifer walks down a path and in the near distance she see a\r\n\r\n          SHED. SLAM!\r\n          The SHED DOOR is kicking open and closed in the breeze.\r\n          She makes her way towards the shed.\r\n          All EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK All\r\n          Jennifer gets to the shed. The door is wide open. She steps\r\n          inside.\r\n\r\n          B11 INT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK B11\r\n\r\n          Inside there is an array of old gardening tools. Pots,\r\n          garbage cans. Some different chemical bottles including a jug\r\n          of LYE.\r\n          Jennifer thinks she hears something from deep inside the\r\n          shed. She moves in further as--\r\n\r\n          SLAM!\r\n          The door shuts behind her -\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Shit!\r\n\r\n          C11 EXT. CABIN, SHED - DUSK C11\r\n\r\n          Jennifer exits, and securely closes the shed door. After a\r\n          beat she smirks at the thought that she thought this was more\r\n          than just a door blowing in the wind, then heads back to the\r\n          cabin.\r\n\r\n          D12 EXT. CABIN, FRONT PORCH -DUSK D12 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer walks up to the chair, moves her laptop, sits and\r\n          then as she grabs her phone she knocks the glass of wine off\r\n          the arm of the chair into her lap.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 10.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Ohhhhh... You gotta be kidding.\r\n          She get up, looks at the red wine stain all over her lap, and\r\n          picks up her things to heads in the cabin.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Way to go Jennifer...\r\n          The last of the days light is disappearing.\r\n\r\n          12 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 12\r\n\r\n          Jennifer stands at the sink, in panties and tank top - pre-\r\n          soaking her sweater and pants.\r\n\r\n          13 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 13 \r\n\r\n\r\n          POV THROUGH KITCHEN WINDOW:\r\n          Jennifer continues at the sink, her beautiful, partially nude\r\n          body is framed perfectly in the window for all to see... but\r\n          no one's around for miles...\r\n\r\n          14 EXT. WOODS - DAY 14 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer jogs through the trees. She wears a tight pair of\r\n          running shorts and a out off T-shirt.\r\n          Jennifer stops in a small clearing. With her hands on her\r\n          knees, she struggles to catch her breath.\r\n          She stands and walks in a circle, looks around. Checks her\r\n          watch.\r\n          Then notices something in the distance hidden behind the\r\n          trees.\r\n          ANGLE ON: A dilapidated shack, rotted from decay and neglect.\r\n          Jennifer's curiosity gets the best of her.\r\n\r\n          15 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 15 \r\n\r\n          She walks up to the shack, looks around. She then enters\r\n          through what is left of the front door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 11.\r\n\r\n          A15 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY A15\r\n\r\n          The place hasn't been occupied in quite a while, but it was\r\n          once. An old, dirty mattress in the corner... a sawhorse-for-\r\n          a-counter with old cans and bottles... even a rusty old\r\n          garden tool or two.\r\n          Near the window she sees an old, mold covered BIBLE propped\r\n          open.\r\n          Jennifer suddenly gets the chills, she shakes it off and then\r\n          gets the hell out of there.\r\n\r\n          16 EXT. CABIN - DAY 16\r\n\r\n           Jennifer finishes her jog and returns to the cabin, leans \r\n           over on the porch and catches her breath. \r\n\r\n          17 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 17 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer stands in front of the mirror. She looks at her\r\n          reflection and pulls out the band that was holding up her\r\n          ponytail. Her sweat-soaked hair falls across her shoulders.\r\n          She turns on the faucet and is met with a dirty spray.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Eww!\r\n          The spray only lasts a few seconds before sputtering out.\r\n          However, then the toilet starts to GURGLE. Jennifer lifts\r\n          the lid up with her foot. The toilet water bubbles up and\r\n          then disappears down the drain.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (SHUDDERS)\r\n          Gross.\r\n          Again, Jennifer tries the sink, but now nothing comes out.\r\n\r\n          18 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 18\r\n\r\n          Jennifer picks up her cellphone from the counter. She takes\r\n          a small piece of paper out of her purse and punches in some\r\n          numbers on the cell. After a few rings, voicemail picks up.\r\n\r\n          EARL MESSAGE(V.O.)\r\n          You've reached the answering machine\r\n          of Earl Wooderson.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12.\r\n\r\n          EARL MESSAGE(V.O.)

If you're calling\r\n          about buying or selling an exotic\r\n          animal, please leave your name --\r\n          Jennifer snaps the phone shut in frustration, when her eye\r\n          catches the water-damaged remnants of a service sticker\r\n          hanging to the refrigerator door.\r\n          Amazingly, the phone number is still visible. She shrugs to\r\n          herself and dials the number.\r\n\r\n          19 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM -- DAY 19\r\n\r\n          She lifts the lid and looks inside - dry - and flushes a few\r\n          more times to no avail - then dirty water begins to gurgle\r\n          up.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n\r\n                         (LISTENS INTENTLY)\r\n          No, it won't flush... I did that\r\n          already... yes... look, I'm really\r\n          in a spot... okay... thank you...\r\n          I'm not going anywhere.\r\n          As Jennifer snaps her phone shut, the handset gets caught on\r\n          her chin, and tumbles into the toilet. PLOP!\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh shit!\r\n          Jennifer reaches down into the toilet and immediately fishes\r\n          it out. She shakes it off vigorously.\r\n\r\n          20 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 20 \r\n\r\n          Jennifer stands next to the kitchen counter. She holds her\r\n          hair dryer which is going at full blast. Her cell phone is\r\n          propped open on the counter in front of her. She's doing her\r\n          best to dry it out.\r\n          Suddenly, a hand reaches out and taps her on the shoulder.\r\n          Jennifer SCREAMS and spins around, turning the hair dryer on\r\n          her assailant.\r\n          An equally frightened MATTHEW throws his hands up in front of\r\n          his face and SCREAMS just as loudly. He has several think\r\n          colored rubber bands on his wrist.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 12A.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          P1... please!

I was knocking on the d...door\r\n          a...a... while.\r\n          Jennifer breathes a sigh of relief, especially after she gets\r\n          a look at Matthew. He's in his mid-30's, but could pass for\r\n          a good ten years younger. Awkward and shy, he can barely\r\n          make eye contact with her.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n\r\n                         (FRIENDLY)\r\n          I think you may have taken a few \r\n          years off my life. \r\n          Matthew doesn't get the joke.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Uh... thanks for coming on such\r\n          short notice.\r\n\r\n                         (NO RESPONSE)\r\n          You need to see the bathroom,\r\n          right?\r\n\r\n          21 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY 21\r\n\r\n          Matthew works away underneath the sink. Jennifer watches him\r\n          from the bedroom sitting on the end of the bed, trying to\r\n          make small talk.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Is this gonna take much longer?\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          (muffled, under the sink)\r\n          N...not much.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          So what's wrong with it?\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          Uh... it's just older pipes.\r\n          Matthew continues his work, you can tell he is uncomfortable\r\n          with the conversation.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          So do you live around here?\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          No...no one lives around here.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 14.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Yeah, I kind of get that. I meant\r\n          in town?\r\n          Matthew comes out from under the sink. He snaps nerviously\r\n          at one of the rubber bands on his wrist.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          My... my whole life...\r\n          Jennifer looks to his wrist. It's all red.\r\n          Matthew turns on the faucet. Out comes a hard stream of\r\n          cold, clear water. He flushes the toilet and then turns on\r\n          the shower to the same result.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW (CONT'D)\r\n          All fixed.\r\n          Jennifer squeals with excitement. She wraps her arms around\r\n          Matthew and plants a kiss on his cheek.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Thank you!\r\n          Matthew blushes furiously and fumbles his tools as he packs\r\n          up. For him, the kiss was more embarrassing than enjoyable.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm sorry. I just... you saved me\r\n          from having to bathe in the pond. \r\n          Once his tools are all packed away, Matthew dashes out of the\r\n          cabin. Jennifer follows him to the front door.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey. Hey! I didn't even pay you!\r\n          But Matthew is long gone.\r\n\r\n          22 EXT.

Then\r\n          he gets right up in Matthew's face.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          You'd have no idea what to do with\r\n          a piece of ass like that.

CABIN - NIGHT 23\r\n\r\n          Jennifer writes away at the dining room table. She's on a\r\n          tear. A \"writer's zone\" where everything she types is gold.\r\n          She hits the \"return\" key hard, as if to punctuate a\r\n          particularly good sentence. She picks up some lip gloss and\r\n          puts it on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 20.\r\n          She leans back to take a break when her eye catches the cell\r\n          phone sitting on the table. She picks the phone up, flips it\r\n          open - It's still completely dead.\r\n          In frustration, she throws the phone across the room. It\r\n          hits the couch right next to the duffle bag. She smiles\r\n          mischievously to herself.\r\n          Jennifer reaches inside and withdraws a sandwich bag filled\r\n          with pot and rolling papers. She expertly rolls herself a\r\n          joint and lights it up. She closes her eyes. Bliss.\r\n\r\n          24 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT -- LATER 24\r\n\r\n          From a distance, the cabin looks like a star twinkling in the\r\n          night sky. Trees sway in the breeze, dappling the light.\r\n\r\n          25 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 25\r\n\r\n          Jennifer's head is slouched over her desk. She passed out.\r\n          Suddenly, A SCRATCHING NOISE at the front door.\r\n          CLOSE ON: Jennifer's eyes flit open as -\r\n          Jennifer jumps awake and walks over to check the door,\r\n          glancing at the clock as she goes. 4:14 am.\r\n          Jennifer gets to the door and listens, Nothing. She tries\r\n          to look out... nothing.\r\n          She turns to walk back when the scratching returns -\r\n          Jennifer takes a few steps back toward the door. Again, the\r\n          noise stops.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Hello?\r\n          Silence. Jennifer rises up on her toes and looks out the\r\n          glass window of the front door. The porch is deserted.\r\n          Jennifer opens the door slowly.\r\n\r\n          26 EXT. CABIN - NIGHT 26\r\n\r\n          Jennifer looks outside but nothing is there. Just a gentle\r\n          breeze and the sway of the trees. Satisfied, she walks out\r\n          onto the front porch, then down the steps. She hugs herself\r\n          and shivers, then she returns inside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 21.\r\n\r\n          27 INT. CABIN, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 27\r\n\r\n          Jennifer shuts the front door and locks it. Then she yanks\r\n          on the door, just to make sure.\r\n\r\n          28 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 28\r\n\r\n          She walks back in grabbing her glass and bottle when --\r\n\r\n          29 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 29\r\n\r\n          The SCRAPING sound again, but this time, from UPSTAIRS.\r\n          Jennifer looks up, hoping that she imagined it. But there it\r\n          is again. She sets the bottle and glass down on the end table\r\n          next to the couch and then grabs a can of MACE from her purse\r\n          on the couch.\r\n\r\n          30 INT. CABIN, STAIRCASE - NIGHT 30 \r\n\r\n          She walks slowly, holding the mace directly in front of her.\r\n          Eventually, Jennifer gets to the top of the stairs.\r\n          At the far end of the hallway is an open window. A branch\r\n          from outside scrapes against the windowsill.\r\n          Jennifer lets out a sigh of relief. She closes the window\r\n          and heads back downstairs.\r\n\r\n          31 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - NIGHT 31 \r\n\r\n          She puts the mace back in her purse, and then picks up her\r\n          drink walking to the kitchen when--\r\n          BANG! Something smashes into the sliding glass door--\r\n          Jennifer SCREAMS dropping the glass. It SHATTERS.\r\n          With more than a hint of trepidation, Jennifer heads towards\r\n\r\n          THE SIDE DOOR.\r\n          With all the courage she can muster up, Jennifer unlocks the\r\n          door and steps outside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22.\r\n\r\n          32 EXT. CABIN, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 32\r\n\r\n          The side porch light acts as a spotlight, illuminating the\r\n          culprit -- a lone bird lies motionless on the ground.\r\n          Jennifer bends down and picks up a small branch from the\r\n          porch. She gives the bird a small poke... nothing. But her\r\n          uneasiness is growing. Suddenly... SLAM!\r\n          She jumps and looks to the shed, the door is open again and\r\n          swinging. She looks to it thinking, \"I shut that already...\"\r\n          She moves off the porch and toward the shed.\r\n\r\n          33 EXT. CABIN, SHED - NIGHT 33\r\n\r\n          Jennifer walks to the shed, it feels longer in the dark. She\r\n          looks around to the tree line, could be something out there,\r\n          an animal, who knows.\r\n          She reaches the shed and shuts the door again. She searches\r\n          the ground and sees a large stone.\r\n          She picks up the stone and shoves it against the door.\r\n          Satisfied, she heads back.\r\n\r\n          34 INT. CABIN - NIGHT 34\r\n\r\n          Jennifer immediately goes over to her table where the laptop\r\n          is set up. She shuffles some papers around when-\r\n          Something on her laptop screen catches her attention. She\r\n          leans forward, brow furrowed.\r\n          ON LAPTOP SCREEN: A picture of Johnny, Stanley, and Andy\r\n          leering into the laptop's camera. Like a nightmarish photo\r\n          booth snapshot.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Nice shot huh?\r\n          Jennifer shrieks and spins around only to find --\r\n          Standing there, right inside the front door, is Johnny. He\r\n          smiles.\r\n          Johnny shrugs calmly and continues milling about the room.\r\n          Jennifer spins around, looking for a way out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 22A.\r\n          But Stanley has slipped in through the back door, video\r\n          camera obnoxiously filming the scene (which will be out to\r\n          throughout).\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Smile real pretty for the camera.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 23.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          (her voice cracking)\r\n          Get out of here. Get out of here\r\n          right now!\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Now that's not very hospitable, is\r\n          it?\r\n          Then, the wooden stairs creak under Andy's steps as he walks\r\n          down -- around his chest is one of Jennifer's bra stretched\r\n          to the limit. He's twirling a thong panty on his finger. The\r\n          guys get a good laugh at Andy.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          All of you better get out of here.\r\n          I called the police.\r\n          Johnny nods. He looks at her, his gaze mocking.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You called the police? Or you will\r\n          call the police?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I... I called them already.\r\n          They're on their way right now!\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          With what phone? Matthew said you\r\n          dropped it in the drink.\r\n          Jennifer doesn't answer.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          (looks at Stanley)\r\n          Speaking of.. .where the hell is he?\r\n          Stanley takes a few steps toward the back door.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Matthew, get your boney ass in\r\n          here!\r\n          Shortly after, Matthew shuffles inside. He can't even bring\r\n          himself to look at Jennifer.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (TO JENNIFER)\r\n          Matthew here said you didn't pay\r\n          him for fixity' your sink?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 24.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          That is just not true! I tried to.\r\n          He ran out... (to Matthew) Is that\r\n          what you said?\r\n          Matthew winces and starts to snap a rubber band on his wrist.\r\n          as Jennifer walks over to her purse.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          I'll take care of it--\r\n          Johnny cuts her off.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          --Let's not worry about that right\r\n          now.\r\n          Johnny hops up on the kitchen counter, cutting her off with\r\n          his leg. He then picks up the bottle of vodka, takes a swig.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Now what's a pretty little thing\r\n          like you doing out here all alone?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I'm writing.

Matthew\r\n          leans against the wall, his eyes on the floor.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Come here.

It lands at her\r\n          feet.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          What's a matter?

The bottle is partially empty.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (TO JENNIFER)\r\n          Uh, what's this?

What are we, dirt?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I didn't say that.\r\n          Andy walks over and sits down at her desk, clicks around the\r\n          screen, begins reading aloud from the text...\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n\r\n                         (READING)\r\n          .No one wants a phone call at 2\r\n          o'clock in the morning.

He finds a\r\n          pack of rice cakes. He shoves one in his mouth, winces,\r\n          spits it out.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Damned cardboard.

What do you want? I offered\r\n          you money.\r\n          Johnny stubbornly holds out the bottle of vodka. Andy\r\n          giggles.

Drinks a\r\n          small sip. They all start booing.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Come on. You can do better than\r\n          that.

Okay. Please. Leave.\r\n          Andy and Stanley plop themselves down on the couch and prop\r\n          their feet up on the wood and glass coffee table.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Oh... that's not what this is\r\n          about.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Then what is this about?\r\n          Johnny jumps down from the counter. He stands in front of\r\n          Jennifer, towering over her.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          I want to see your teeth.\r\n          As if the air is sucked out of the room. Jennifer stares at\r\n          him, not even sure she heard him correctly.\r\n          Matthew snaps the rubber band harder. He moves to the far\r\n          corner of the room and tucks himself against the wall.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Wha... what?\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You heard me, show Horse.

Johnny smacks it against his palm.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          .or lose the teeth.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 27A.\r\n          Andy walks back to the couch and flicks another match at\r\n          Jennifer. She recoils with fear as she reluctantly gives a\r\n          half-smile, her teeth clenched together.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 28.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          No. Put two fingers in the side of\r\n          your mouth. Then two fingers in\r\n          the other side... and pull.\r\n          Jennifer looks at Johnny like he's seriously disturbed as\r\n          Johnny slaps the bat against his hand punctuating his point.\r\n          Jennifer puts her fingers in her mouth. She pulls her lips\r\n          away from the gums, spreading them grotesquely. It's\r\n          completely humiliating. Jennifer stops.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Now please... I'm begging you...\r\n          Johnny slides off the counter.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Uh, uh. Again.\r\n          Jennifer reinserts her fingers and pulls. Johnny reaches\r\n          into her mouth and grabs a hold of her two front teeth with\r\n          his thumb and forefinger.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Alright. Good girl, Show Horse.\r\n          Johnny pulls down on Jennifer's teeth, forcing her to the\r\n          floor. Jennifer looks as if she's about to cry, near her on\r\n          the ground is the broken glass.\r\n          Stanley and Andy needle each other like schoolboys. Matthew\r\n          shuffles nervously, clearly uncomfortable at being there.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          I'll tell you something\r\n          sweetheart... know why you ain't\r\n          got no boyfriend?... 'Cause all\r\n          them city guys are faggots.\r\n          Johnny turns to her.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          But uh... since he isn't here.\r\n          Johnny pulls out his revolver.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          This is your man.\r\n          He moves closer to her, rubbing the gun against her cheek,\r\n          her chin. The blood drains from her face as -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Why don't you give him a kiss-\r\n          With terror in her eyes, Jennifer quickly kisses the gun-\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Nah, not like the peck you gave\r\n          Matthew... let's see a real kiss.\r\n          He slides the barrel into Jennifer's mouth. Jennifer gags\r\n          instinctively. Johnny holds the back of her head, not\r\n          allowing her to pull away, and offers some \"encouragement.\"\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Breathe through your nose. Breathe\r\n          through your nose like it was your\r\n          first time.\r\n          Johnny pulls the gun out just a tiny bit and pushes it back\r\n          into her cheek, causing it to bulge out.\r\n          Naturally, Stanley and Andy both find this hysterical.\r\n          Especially once Jennifer begins to cry.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JENNIFER)\r\n          On your knees.\r\n          Jennifer complies. Johnny holds the gun in front of his\r\n          crotch and again forces it into Jennifer's mouth.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          if I don't like your enthusiasm, I\r\n          may cum early.\r\n          (cocks the gun)\r\n          And that's something you really\r\n          don't want.\r\n          Jennifer has no choice. She begins to fellate the gun, as\r\n          deep as she can take it without gagging.\r\n          Johnny closes his eyes and feigns pleasure. Finally, he's\r\n          had enough. He retracts the gun as Jennifer recoils, gags.\r\n          Her eyes begin to scan the cabin for any way out of this hell\r\n          as Andy stands up from the couch.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          My turn.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 29A.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Come on, let Matthew have a go.\r\n          It's his girlfriend and he hasn't\r\n          even wet his whistle yet.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 30.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          I...I ddd...don't want to.\r\n          Johnny walks up to Matthew, angrily, and slaps him across the\r\n          face. He points to Jennifer.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          What do you mean you don't want to?\r\n\r\n                         (TEASING)\r\n          sh...she likes me... she kissed me.\r\n          Now shut up and prove it.\r\n          Matthew holds his fist against his face.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Aw, fuck it. I ain't waiting.\r\n          Andy grabs the VODKA BOTTLE. He walks over to Jennifer,\r\n          still on her knees, and positions the bottle right in front\r\n          of his crotch.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          Suck it, bitch.\r\n          Jennifer opens her mouth and moves her head toward the\r\n          bottle. As she maneuvers the bottle-neck into her mouth, her\r\n          eye catches a large shard of glass next to Andy's boot.\r\n          As soon as Andy turns around to smile at his friends,\r\n          Jennifer grabs the bottle and cracks it upside his kneecap.\r\n          Andy immediately grabs his leg and falls to the floor.\r\n          The guys start laughing as--\r\n          Jennifer leaps up from the floor and rushes over to her\r\n          purse. She quickly pulls out a canister of mace -\r\n          Before the guys even register what is happening Jennifer is\r\n          racing at Stanley --\r\n          As he brings the camera down he's met with a spray of mace.\r\n          He clutches his face, screaming in pain --\r\n          And like that - Jennifer is out the back door.\r\n\r\n          35 EXT. CABIN - DAWN 35\r\n\r\n          Jennifer leaps over the porch steps and sprints across the\r\n          backyard as the first light creeps through the trees. Within\r\n          seconds, she's in the woods.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 31.\r\n\r\n          36 EXT. WOODS - DAWN 36\r\n\r\n          Jennifer runs for all she's worth. Every few yards, she\r\n          looks behind her, just to make sure that no one is chasing\r\n          her. The morning light now fully visible. Then, just as she\r\n          turns back around, Jennifer smacks right into something and\r\n          goes sprawling.\r\n          When her vision comes into focus she sees the side of a shiny\r\n          black boot. Next to it, the long slim barrel of a shotgun.\r\n          Jennifer looks up at the figure.\r\n\r\n                         FIGURE\r\n          Whoa, whoa, whoa there. Easy\r\n          darlin'.\r\n          The Figure extends his hand. As Jennifer reaches for it, she\r\n          sees his jacket pull away from his chest, revealing a silver\r\n          badge. She's found SHERIFF STORCH, a small town sheriff with\r\n          a small town charm that can easily be confused as smarmy.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Help me. Please!\r\n          Standing next to the Sheriff, also holding a hunting rifle,\r\n          is Earl. Earl looks over at the Sheriff.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Okay, okay, I gotcha.\r\n          The Sheriff helps Jennifer to her feet.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          I know this one. She rented the\r\n          place down on Mockingbird Trail.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I was assaulted! They broke into\r\n          the cabin! They had a gun-\r\n          Jennifer breaks down again.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Ma'am, please, you have to calm\r\n          down.\r\n          But Jennifer is hysterical, desperately holding back tears.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          In my mouth! He put a gun in my\r\n          mouth! You don't understand...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 32.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Ma'am, It's okay. I'm the Sheriff.\r\n          You need to take a deep breath and\r\n          tell me what happened.\r\n          Jennifer forces herself to take a deep breath and manages to\r\n          pull herself together.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Four men. It was four of them.\r\n          They broke into my cabin... They\r\n          assaulted me!\r\n          Earl just watches not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Are you hurt? Do you need a\r\n          hospital?\r\n          Jennifer shakes her head.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Okay, good. That's good. Did you\r\n          get a good look at them? Can you\r\n          ID 'em?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Yes, I'd seen them before.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Around here?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          At the service station right\r\n          outside of town.

CABIN - DAY 37\r\n          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer pull up to the cabin. They both\r\n          get out of the cruiser. With his double barrel shotgun in\r\n          hand, Sheriff Storch begins walking up toward the porch.\r\n\r\n          38 INT. CABIN - DAY 38 \r\n\r\n          Sheriff Storch and Jennifer enter the cabin. It appears\r\n          empty.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Miller? Miller, this is the\r\n          Sheriff. if you and your boys are\r\n          still in there, you come on out\r\n          right now.\r\n          Sheriff Storch disappears into the kitchen for a second...\r\n          then back out as he makes his way over to the foot of the\r\n          stairs. He looks up the staircase.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Miller, if you're up there, you'll\r\n          be leaving by the window.\r\n          No answer. Sheriff Storch looks at Jennifer.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Stay here.\r\n          Sheriff Storch heads up the stairs. Jennifer, uncomfortable\r\n          at being left alone, backs away to the wall. Every noise,\r\n          every foot step makes her shiver.\r\n          After a few seconds, the Sheriff comes back to the top of the\r\n          stairs.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 34.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          It's empty.\r\n          He walks back down.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          No sign of 'em. If they were here,\r\n          they're gone now.\r\n          Sheriff Storch makes his way through and walks back into--\r\n\r\n          39 INT. CABIN, KITCHEN - DAY 39\r\n\r\n          Jennifer follows him and watches as he inspects it closely.\r\n          His eyes fall on the box of liquor bottles.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          You here alone? \r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Yes.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n\r\n                         (RE: LIQUOR)\r\n          With all this?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I wasn't going to drink it all this\r\n          weekend.

They forced\r\n          me to.\r\n          He moves away and walks back through the cabin.\r\n          As he does, he spots the glass shattered on the floor... and\r\n          the nearby THONG and BRA that Andy flung at her.\r\n          Takes a long hard look at them, then looks back up to\r\n          Jennifer.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          One of them, he was up there, went\r\n          through everything.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 35.\r\n          Sheriff Storch taps the broken glass with his thick boot.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          (pointing to the glass)\r\n          They do this, too?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Please, I don't care about those\r\n          things. They shoved a gun in my\r\n          mouth...\r\n          Jennifer breaks down again as the Sheriff moves toward her. \r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Okay, okay Ma'am. It's okay now.\r\n          Them boys are gone. You're safe\r\n          now.\r\n          Jennifer nods to him, still shaken. Storch looks to the lock \r\n          on the back door. \r\n          He walks toward the back door and turns the dead bolt back \r\n          and forth.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D) \r\n          (re: back door)\r\n          Was this locked?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Yes. Of course.\r\n\r\n          40 EXT. CABIN - DAY 40 \r\n\r\n          Sheriff Storch steps onto the porch. Jennifer follows.\r\n          Sheriff Storch looks down and sees the dead bird at his feet.\r\n          He pokes it with the barrel of his shotgun.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          How long you been here?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Just a few days.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Anything strange happen before\r\n          this? You have a run in with any\r\n          of these guys?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          No. Not really. I stopped for gas\r\n          and directions.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 36.\r\n\r\n          41 INT. CABIN - DAY 41\r\n\r\n          Back inside, Sheriff Storch hooks his fingers into his belt\r\n          and continues to look around.\r\n          His eyes casually fall upon the roach sitting in the ashtray.\r\n          He picks it up and smells it.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Ma'am, is this your marijuana\r\n          cigarette? \r\n           Suddenly, Jennifer realizes that simple possession might not\r\n          go over in this small town like it does in Manhattan.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Uh... n...no. The men probably\r\n          left it.\r\n          Sheriff Storch walks over to Jennifer until he's standing\r\n          directly in front of her.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          You mean to tell me that one of\r\n          these guys was wearing lipstick?\r\n          Storch holds up the roach. Jennifer notices the lipstick\r\n          smear on the rolling paper. She casts her eyes downward.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          This ain't the big city.\r\n          Sheriff Storch stands uncomfortably close. Slowly, he walks\r\n          closer up to Jennifer's face, stares into her eyelids. Pulls\r\n          down one of them. Then the other. Then his gaze falls down\r\n          to her chest... her ample cleavage. His stare lingers a bit\r\n          too long.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Please, I swear. I didn't make it\r\n          up. I may have smoked a joint, but-\r\n          Sheriff Storch lifts his walkie-talkie to his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          (into the walkie-talkie)\r\n          This is Sheriff Storch. I'm at the\r\n          Mockingbird Cabin. I gonna need\r\n          some backup.\r\n          The words out of the Sheriff's mouth seem almost surreal.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n\r\n                         (BECOMING FRANTIC)\r\n          Backup? What could you possibly\r\n          need back up for? I'm the victim.\r\n          Sheriff Storch holds up his hand, cutting her off.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Ma'am. You've been drinking and\r\n          smoking marijuana, and you got\r\n          enough alcohol here to put our\r\n          whole town three sheets to the\r\n          wind. You're running around in\r\n          your nighty at the crack of dawn...\r\n          You need to see this from my point\r\n          of view.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          What?! They were here! They\r\n          assaulted me! You've got to\r\n          believe me!\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          I just want to get to the bottom of\r\n          it. You're making serious\r\n          accusations bout' boys I've know\r\n          since they was kids, and you \r\n          haven't been all together truthful\r\n          now have you?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Now please, against the wall.\r\n          Angry and ashamed, Jennifer walks over and places her palms\r\n          against the wall, her legs pressed tightly together.\r\n          Sheriff Storch inches up behind her. He taps the inside of\r\n          her thigh with his shotgun.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Shoulder width apart, face to the\r\n          wall.\r\n          Jennifer has no choice but to comply.\r\n          He pats up and down Jennifer's side. When he gets to the\r\n          swell of her breast, he slides his hand to the front ever so\r\n          slightly. Jennifer reflexively turns--\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Face to the wall!\r\n          Sheriff Storch puts his hand to the side of her face and puts\r\n          it to the wall. Jennifer cringes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 37A.\r\n          Then he kicks her leg out wide with a firm Boot as he starts\r\n          to frisk her entire body, creeping his hands ever so close to\r\n          her crotch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          I want the whole story, now. The\r\n          whole thing.\r\n\r\n                         (SLOWLY)\r\n          Start with telling me what those\r\n          boys did.\r\n          A long, dreadful beat hangs in the air as--\r\n\r\n          JOHNNY (O.S.)\r\n          Yeah, and tell the truth, show\r\n          Horse.\r\n          Jennifer snaps her head around again to see Johnny enter the\r\n          cabin as Andy and Stanely push Matthew in front of them.\r\n          Johnny walks over to Jennifer. He stands next to the\r\n          Sheriff.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          Better yet, let's show him. As I\r\n          recall, those pretty little lips\r\n          couldn't get enough.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n\r\n                         (MOCK SURPIRSE)\r\n          Really?\r\n          Sheriff Storch then takes the barrel of his shotgun and\r\n          pushes down the top of Jennifer's blouse.\r\n          Jennifer's paralyzed as he runs the shotgun across her\r\n          nipple.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JENNIFER)\r\n          They do this to you?\r\n          Jennifer is too terrified to speak. Sheriff Storch then\r\n          slips the shotgun down between her legs.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          I asked you a question.\r\n          Jennifer trembles with fear.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Please...\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Show him those teeth, Show Horse.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 38A.\r\n          Sheriff Storch brings the gun back up to her mouth - slides\r\n          it under Jennifer's top lip and pushes it up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 39.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Whinny.\r\n          With her top lip forced up by the barrel of the shotgun,\r\n          Jennifer can only make a GRUNTING noise. Sheriff Storch\r\n          takes the shotgun out of Jennifer's mouth and places it flush\r\n          against the side of her head. He pushes her to the floor.\r\n          Jennifer lets out a YELP as she falls.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          I said, whinny.\r\n          Jennifer makes a pathetic SOUND. Not really a whinny, but\r\n          more of a half-cry, half-snort. Naturally, this amuses Andy\r\n          and Stanley -- who is, of course, filming it -- to no end.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Oh, man. Oh, man.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n\r\n                         (TO JENNIFER)\r\n          On your knees. And keep going.\r\n          Jennifer gets to her knees. As instructed, she whinnies,\r\n          interspersed with sobs. Johnny slaps her ass viciously.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Keep whinnying!\r\n          Jennifer looks up at Sheriff Storch with pleading eyes.\r\n          Sheriff Storch picks her up by her hair but--\r\n          Jennifer comes up swinging -- connecting with the Sheriff's\r\n          face. The slightest scratch across his lip.\r\n          Sheriff Storch turns beet red. He backhands her across the\r\n          face sending her back down to the floor. A thin line of\r\n          blood flows from her nose. The Sheriff looks over to Johnny,\r\n          licks his lip and nods his head.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Think you outta tame this little\r\n          mare of yours.\r\n          Johnny takes the Sheriff's lead.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Alright, come on, Show Horse. Get\r\n          up. Or you won't get a sugar cube.\r\n          Jennifer struggles to her feet. She stands in front of them,\r\n          defenseless. Johnny grabs her hair and pulls her head far\r\n          back. She lets out a half-moan.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 40.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO MATTHEW)\r\n          Take off your clothes. We're about\r\n          to pop your cherry.\r\n          Matthew shakes his head. His wrist is not beat red from the\r\n          rubber bands. Snap!\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm not asking, now cut that rubber\r\n          band shit faggot.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Come on, Matthew. You want to talk\r\n          the talk, then walk the walk, you\r\n          virgin.\r\n          Johnny flicks open a pocket knife. He tickles Jennifer's\r\n          bottom lip with the blade, then gently runs it down her chin,\r\n          past her neck, and between her breasts, just before stopping\r\n          at the waistband, then he slices the waistband of her pants -\r\n          her pants drop to the floor.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (TO MATTHEW)\r\n          Do it now. Or else I slice her\r\n          chin to cunt.\r\n          This gets Matthew moving. A few seconds later, he's in his\r\n          boxer shorts, with his hands crossed in front of his crotch.\r\n          Johnny grabs him and throws him up against the wall. He then\r\n          yanks his boxers down. Matthew immediately covers up his\r\n          crotch.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Matthew, what the hell? It's not\r\n          even hard!\r\n          Matthew sweats profusely.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Well, maybe it's not totally his\r\n          fault. After all, she's not doing\r\n          much to get his motor running.\r\n          Sheriff Storch looks back to Jennifer.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Dance.\r\n          Jennifer begins to cry again.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 41.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Stop it. Or else I'll really give\r\n          you something to cry about. Now\r\n          dance for the boy...\r\n          Jennifer starts to dance in the middle of the room. It is\r\n          sad, pathetic, and downright frightening.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Come on. Move that rear of your's\r\n          Show Horse. Prance for us.\r\n          Sheriff Storch stalks around her, taking it all in, then he\r\n          walks back in closer to her, in her face.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          You dance like that in those city\r\n          clubs?\r\n          Jennifer closes her eyes.

Like you\r\n          do when you want to get laid.\r\n          With a swift, hard backhand, Sheriff Storch smacks her ass\r\n          and hard.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          That'll get her moving.\r\n          The guys hoot and holler.

With no warning,\r\n          Matthew takes Jennifer's face in his hands and kisses her.\r\n          The men HOWL with sadistic glee. Jennifer slaps him right\r\n          across the face, then she tries to run but--\r\n          Sheriff Storch forces her to the ground. He walks up to\r\n          Matthew.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Don't waste my time you thickheaded\r\n          prick.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 42.\r\n          Johnny pushes Matthew down on top of her.\r\n          Jennifer instinctively swings and connects with Matthew's\r\n          face - He recoils in pain - but the guys cheer him on as they\r\n          decide to help him out. Andy tears open her shirt, Johnny\r\n          yanks down her panties. Jennifer claws and kicks at all of\r\n          them as she desperately tries to fight him off.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Get her legs!\r\n          Sheriff Storch kneels down and holds Jennifer's arms above\r\n          her head. Johnny takes one leg; Andy takes the other.\r\n          Matthew moves on top of her. Jennifer lets out an inhuman\r\n          SCREAM, the vocal culmination of it all.\r\n          ON JENNIFER'S FACE: Her eyes are tightly shut as she goes in\r\n          and out of focus.\r\n          Suddenly, a cell phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch looks down at\r\n          his pocket, then over to Stanley.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Put that thing down and hold her\r\n          arms, keep her quiet.\r\n          Stanley places the CAM on top of the table - it's still\r\n          getting everything.\r\n          Sheriff Storch walks a few paces away from the rape. He\r\n          looks down at the screen of his phone.\r\n          On the PHONE is a photo of an angelic little girl with the\r\n          banner of CHASTITY. Storch presses a button.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          Hello, Angel.\r\n\r\n          CHASTITY (V.0.)\r\n          Hi, Daddy.

Out on a call.\r\n          WIDESHOT: In the foreground, Sheriff Storch speaks casually\r\n          to his daughter. In the background, Jennifer's legs are the\r\n          only visual cues of the struggle that goes on right behind.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 43.\r\n\r\n          CHASTITY (V.0.)\r\n          Oh, sorry.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n\r\n                         (INTO PHONE)\r\n          It's okay.

Tell mother I'm running a\r\n          little late.\r\n          Sheriff Storch stares at the phone for a second, then slides\r\n          the phone back into his pocket. As he turns back around\r\n          Jennifer, with all her strength, bucks Matthew off.\r\n          The guys start laughing hysterically.\r\n          She finally gets her hands free and lands a barrage of\r\n          punches in Matthew's face.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Jesus, Matthew. You're getting\r\n          your ass whooped by a girl!\r\n          Matthew snaps: He wraps his hands around her neck and begins\r\n          pumping away like a lunatic. For some reason, the anger\r\n          allows him to perform.\r\n          Jennifer struggles to breathe. Luckily, before all oxygen to\r\n          her brain is cut off, Matthew stops. He SCREAMS as he\r\n          finishes. His hands fall from her neck as he collapses on\r\n          top of her.\r\n          The MEN all cheer as Matthew staggers to his feet -- weak.\r\n          He looks like he could throw up -- and he does - right off to\r\n          the side as the others just lose it!\r\n          Jennifer curls herself into a ball and SOBS.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n\r\n                         (TO MATTHEW)\r\n          You can thank us later.\r\n          Matthew recovers, gets up and runs to the bathroom. Johnny\r\n          points to the vomit.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 44.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (TO STANLEY)\r\n          Clean this shit up.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Make her do it.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (ANGRILY)\r\n          Just do it you piece of shit!\r\n          Jennifer grabs the end of the coffee table and forces herself\r\n          up. She steadies herself, keeping one hand on the wall, and\r\n          stumbles to the back door. Surprisingly, none of the men\r\n          attempt to stop her. They don't even look in her direction.\r\n          Jennifer staggers out the back door, trying to catch her\r\n          breath as she fearfully stumbles off into the woods.\r\n\r\n          42 EXT. WOODS - DAY 42 \r\n\r\n          Like a zombie, Jennifer shuffles through the woods, oblivious\r\n          to the cold air, rocks, thorns, mud, as her bare feet move\r\n          her along.\r\n          She desperately continues on through, looking for a way out.\r\n          But in her state, she has no sense of navigation. She\r\n          continues to lose herself further and further into the\r\n          forest.\r\n          As she finally steps into the clearing, the melancholy notes\r\n          of a harmonica shatter the stillness... She's made her way to-\r\n\r\n          43 EXT. FISHING HOLE - DAY 43\r\n\r\n          Andy sits on a log blowing softly into the harmonica as the\r\n          rest of the guys lounge around casually as if they\r\n          instinctively knew she'd end up here. Jennifer is too\r\n          shocked to move, too tired to cry.\r\n          Jennifer tries to escape but Johnny stops her. He grabs her\r\n          by the shoulders and throws her to Andy who smacks her down\r\n          in the shallow water. Andy pounces down on her back.\r\n          Stanley kneels down right in front of Jennifer's face. He\r\n          places the MiniDV cam only a few feet in front of her. He\r\n          then turns the LCD so it's facing Jennifer -- so she can\r\n          actually watch herself being abused.\r\n          Andy pulls her eyelids wide open and holds them there.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 44A.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          You ever get mace in your eyes,\r\n          bitch?

Her eyes\r\n          continue to scan the area for Johnny who's nowhere in sight.\r\n          Then immediately her eyes dart back to the GUN.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 45A.\r\n           As Jennifer's body is being jerked back and forth, she\r\n          reaches - and reaches - closer with each stretch when--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46.\r\n          A heavy work boot comes down on her hand, crushing it.\r\n          Jennifer looks up.\r\n          Johnny glares down at her, then unzips his pants as he moves\r\n          in closer to her face.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          No teeth Show Horse.

The men all stare, impressed at her resolve.\r\n          Jennifer's torn clothes hang loosely off her body as she\r\n          staggers away and wanders aimlessly away from them. It's a\r\n          miracle she can even walk.\r\n          She continues until the forest ends and she comes upon a--\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 46A.\r\n\r\n          45 EXT.

Immediately, he brings his hand to his mouth and\r\n          coughs violently.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Every time I come in here this\r\n          place gets worse.\r\n          Earl's bent over one of the tanks, elbow-deep in fetid water.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Yeah, but business gets better.\r\n          That's the trade off.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 53.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Yeah, well, you're lucky I don't\r\n          cite you for being a public health\r\n          hazard.\r\n          Sheriff Storch reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of\r\n          keys. He holds them in the air and JINGLES them. Earl\r\n          finally looks up, confused.\r\n\r\n          SHERIFF STORCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Mockingbird Trail.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Mockingbird Trail, what? -- Oh,\r\n          right, Miss Hills. What happened?\r\n          She left?\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Yeah, I couldn't make heads or\r\n          tails of it. Found marijuana\r\n          cigarettes, case of booze, looked \r\n          to me like she was a party girl...\r\n          a very wild one.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Yeah, yeah.

Don't know \r\n          about you but I'm getting tired of\r\n          shooting squirrels.\r\n\r\n                         SHERIFF STORCH\r\n          Me too.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 54.\r\n          Earl nods. Sheriff tips his hat and walks out.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          54 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 54 \r\n\r\n          THE CAMERA tilts down from the treeline and falls back on\r\n          Hendersonville. It's serene, peaceful and lonely. \r\n          Matthew sits in a small boat. He's been patrolling for\r\n          Jennifer's body, but now the boat just sits in the middle of\r\n          the swamp where the river runs out.\r\n          He stares out into the water as we slowly creep closer, and\r\n          closer until we're extremely close on his face, his eyes\r\n          unmoving.\r\n\r\n          A55 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY A55\r\n\r\n          POV: A car with two women pulls up to the gas pump. Johnny\r\n          comes out of the garage and saunters over to them.\r\n          Johnny playfully harasses the women. To a casual observer,\r\n          it would seem harmless. But we know it could be the prelude\r\n          to something unspeakable.\r\n          Finally, the women pull away. Johnny walks back into the\r\n          garage, a smug, self-satisfied smile on his face.\r\n\r\n          55 INT. SERVICE STATION, GARAGE - DAY 55 \r\n\r\n          Andy is bent over Jennifer's car, or at least what's left of\r\n          it. At this point, it's nothing more than a shell. He wears\r\n          a welding helmet and is hard at work with a blowtorch.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          (from under the car)\r\n          Round up some tail out there?\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Maybe. Guarantee you they'll be\r\n          back.\r\n          Johnny looks up as Stanley stumbles into the garage, holding\r\n          a six pack of beer.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          It's happy hour.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 55.\r\n          Johnny opens his hands, signaling Stanley to toss him a can.\r\n          Andy shuts off the blowtorch and lifts up the helmet.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Fucking A.\r\n          Johnny cracks open the beer and takes a gulp. He wipes the\r\n          back of his hand across his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (TO STANLEY)\r\n          You bought beer? What'd your\r\n          mother put you back on an\r\n          allowance?\r\n          They all laugh.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Just figured we deserved a break.\r\n          Andy holds up his beer in a mock toast.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          To your moma.\r\n          Johnny points to Andy, his beer still in his hand.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Just one, you hear me? Don't need\r\n          you passing out on your watch you\r\n          lightweight.\r\n          Andy takes a large sip.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Heck, just let Matthew take all the\r\n          shifts. He's been down there\r\n          everyday anyway. Even when it's\r\n          not his turn. \r\n          They all look to one another.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          The fuck's he doing down there?\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          I don't know. Last time I saw him,\r\n          he wasn't lookin' too good.\r\n          Maybe we should give him a break.\r\n          Pull him off all together. \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 56.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY \r\n          Bullshit. It's been over two\r\n          weeks. I'm tired of searching. If\r\n          she didn't turn up yet, she ain't\r\n          gonna.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          You'll keep lookin' till I tell ya'\r\n          to stop.\r\n           As he turns away there is a bag of Stanley's pork rinds, he \r\n           grabs it and throws it at Stanley.\r\n\r\n                          JOHNNY (CONT'D) \r\n           Here's your supplies. \r\n           Andy starts to laugh as Johnny exits. \r\n\r\n          56 EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY 56\r\n\r\n           From a distance we see Andy laughing and Johnny walking off. \r\n\r\n                         57 OMITTED 57\r\n\r\n          A57 INT. CABIN - DAY (FORMERLY SCENE 62) A57 \r\n\r\n          Matthew stands in the main room staring at the floor - the\r\n          exact place where he raped Jennifer. After a long, drawn out\r\n          moment, he turns and walks to--\r\n\r\n          B57 INT. CABIN, BATHROOM - DAY (FORHERLY SCENE 62) B57 \r\n\r\n          He looks down to the toilet, then the bathtub. He turns\r\n          around accidentally catches his reflection in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 57.\r\n          His greasy, unkempt hair hangs in front of his eyes. He\r\n          pushes it to the side and stares at himself for a long time.\r\n          Finally, Matthew reaches to the light switch, he flicks it\r\n          off. Immediately, the room goes dark. But the second it\r\n          does...\r\n          JENNIFER is sitting on the bed just like when they first met.\r\n\r\n          DEAD, DRENCHED, BEATEN, BATTERED, AND DECAYED, BUT IT'S\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER --\r\n          Matthew is paralyzed with fear, he tries to turn as a\r\n          grizzly, decayed hand grabs his forehead. Another grabs hold\r\n          of his throat.\r\n          A mouth caked with dirt and dried blood begins to kiss up his\r\n          neck, his face-\r\n          Matthew screams wildly\r\n\r\n          58 EXT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 58\r\n\r\n          The Sheriff's car sits in the driveway. It's dark, but for\r\n          the light from a TV strobing against the drapes.\r\n\r\n          59 INT. SHERIFF STORCH'S HOUSE - NIGHT 59 \r\n\r\n          All is quiet. Sheriff Storch reclines in his lazyboy. Mrs.\r\n          Storch is on the sofa rifling through a TV journal.\r\n          The phone RINGS. Sheriff Storch lifts his head up.

One hand is down\r\n          his pants and the other holds a bottle of whisky.\r\n          Suddenly, there's a CRASH at his front door. Johnny looks up\r\n          and puts down the bottle, not overly concerned.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Hello?\r\n          No answer at the door. Johnny groans and gets off the couch,\r\n          annoyed at being disturbed. He walks over to the front door\r\n          and yanks it open.\r\n          The front porch is empty. Just as he's about to close the\r\n          door, he glances down. There's a dead bird on the stoop.\r\n          Johnny narrows his eyes and looks out into the night. Then\r\n          he closes the door and returns to the couch.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64.\r\n          But as soon as he picks up the bottle, there's another CRASH\r\n          at the front door. Johnny, now pissed, races to the front\r\n          door and swings it open.\r\n          A second dead bird has joined the first. Without closing the\r\n          door, Johnny backs up into his house.\r\n          A few seconds later, he returns to the front door, pistol in\r\n          hand. He steps out onto the porch.\r\n\r\n          67 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 67\r\n\r\n          Johnny holds the gun in front of him.

See\r\n          how funny a bullet in your ass is!\r\n          When there's still no response -- Johnny finally backs up\r\n          into the house and closes the door.\r\n\r\n          68 INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 68\r\n\r\n          Again, back to the couch. And again, the second his ass hits\r\n          the cushion, another CRASH.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Got dammit!\r\n          This time, Johnny races to the door and yanks it open,\r\n          cocking the gun on the way and fires into the night.\r\n\r\n          69 EXT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH - NIGHT 69\r\n\r\n          Johnny causally looks down - but this time it's not a bird.\r\n          It's a shoe... Jennifer's shoe.\r\n          Johnny bends down and picks it up. He studies it. Frowns.\r\n          Someone's gone too far. Then he hears something scurry off\r\n          in-the distance.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 64A.\r\n          Quickly Johnny gives chase - leaping off his porch and racing\r\n          in the direction of the sound.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 65.\r\n          Johnny stops, listens, and waits. Nothing but silence. He\r\n          turns around in all directions.\r\n          Johnny spits and turns around to walk back and as he does, he\r\n          notices one of Matthew's colored RUBBER BANDS lying in the\r\n          mud.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n\r\n                         (UNDER BREATH)\r\n          Son of a bitch.\r\n\r\n          70 INT.

This ain't good.\r\n          Johnny picks the shoe up.\r\n          Storch blasts out of his car, shotgun in hand.

CABIN - DAY 72 \r\n\r\n          Matthew, disheveled and weary, stumbles up the steps of the\r\n          cabin. We get the feeling that this is almost a daily\r\n          pilgrimage, as if he returns here to assuage his guilt.\r\n          He rests his head on the wooden railing of the porch, for a\r\n          moment it looks as if he's about to cry.\r\n\r\n          VOICE (O.S.)\r\n          (from inside the cabin;\r\n          creepy and ethereal)\r\n          Matthew...\r\n          Matthew's head snaps up.

CABIN, UPSTAIRS - DAY 74\r\n\r\n          Matthew, wild-eyed and panicked, gets to the top of the\r\n          steps.

Matthew\r\n          glances down the staircase. When he sees that nobody is\r\n          waiting at the bottom, he heads down there.\r\n          But once his foot touches the third step, the board gives out\r\n          as Matthew crashes down the steps, ass-over-tea kettle.\r\n\r\n          75 INT.

He\r\n          struggles to get his bearings as he lays at the bottom of the\r\n          stairs; the side of his head rests on the floor. A thin\r\n          line of blood has already started to run down his cheek.\r\n          Matthew's vision starts to come back into focus as a BLURRY\r\n          IMAGE starts to move away from him. As the IMAGE gets\r\n          further away - it comes into focus - JENNIFER\r\n          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the \r\n          beating and trauma she went through.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 71.\r\n          Matthew grunts and groans as he tries to get up--\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n\r\n                         (STAMMERS)\r\n          I...

Are you\r\n          sure you're'not dreaming again? \r\n          Matthew shakes his head quickly from side to side. He's not\r\n          sure of anything any more.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          I...am I dreaming?\r\n          Jennifer pats the couch next to her.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Come here. Come sit down.\r\n          Matthew staggers to his feet. He's overcome with emotion.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n          I... I... need to tell...\r\n          Jennifer holds a single finger to her lips.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 72.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          Shh... it's all okay, Matthew.

I really did.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I know that, Matthew. Now come.\r\n          Matthew sits down next to Jennifer. It's almost as if some\r\n          force is controlling him. Matthew looks into her eyes.\r\n          He leans forwards and rests his head in Jennifer's lap. He \r\n          finally lets himself go, like a child having a meltdown.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n\r\n                         (SOBBING)\r\n          I'm sorry.

I know you are.\r\n          Matthew's so caught up in the moment, that he fails to notice\r\n          A ROPE from the tool shed with a good SLIT KNOT being snaked\r\n          around his neck.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          But tell me again, Matthew. I want\r\n          to hear how sorry you are.\r\n          Matthew's eyes fly open. Jennifer's hands jerk backwards.\r\n          The rope digs into his flesh. He tries to speak but his\r\n          windpipe can't produce any sound.\r\n          Matthew rolls to the floor, Jennifer never loses her grasp.\r\n          She stands over Matthew, twisting the rope as hard as she\r\n          can. His eyes bulge, the veins in his face protrude--\r\n          Realizing he's about to slip away forever, Matthew displays\r\n          one last burst of strength but Jennifer uses her leverage to\r\n          get her foot on his chest and pulls harder.\r\n          Frightened and furious, Matthew whips Jennifer around again.\r\n          But she refuses to let go.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOXG PINK 10/29/09 73.\r\n          Finally, Matthew's body has had enough. He feet stop kicking\r\n          and just twitch. Then he just gasps like a fish dying out of\r\n          water.\r\n          Jennifer bends over Matthew. She's only inches from his\r\n          face. He's alive, but in terrible shape.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          (whispers in his ear)\r\n          Tell me again...\r\n          CLOSE ON: Matthew's mouth. He can't actually speak; his\r\n          voice box shattered. But he mouths the words.\r\n\r\n                         MATTHEW\r\n\r\n                         (STRUGGLING)\r\n          I'm sorry.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I'm sorry? That's just not good\r\n          enough.\r\n          She pulls the slip knot around his neck again and begins to\r\n\r\n                         CHOKE HIM--\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Now I want you to cry like a little\r\n          girl for me.\r\n          Matthew begins to wail.\r\n\r\n          A75 EXT. CABIN, DAY A75\r\n\r\n           Matthews screams echoes out through woods, but his, much like\r\n           Jennifer, go unheard.\r\n\r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          B75 EXT.

A sense of calm restored.\r\n\r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          C75 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - NIGHT C75\r\n\r\n           Jennifer walks into focus - \r\n          We see her now, wounds healed, only the faintest hint of the\r\n          beating and trauma she went through.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 73A.\r\n          But in her eyes --- her eyes still tell the whole story. This \r\n           is no longer the Jennifer we've known. She looks down. \r\n           ANGLE ON: A BIBLE, the old moldy one from the dilapidated \r\n           shack. It rests on the windowsill - opened to a passage. \r\n          CZrO$E ON: Exodus 21:23-25: .And if any mischief follow, \r\n           than thou shalt give life for life, Eye for eye, tooth for \r\n           tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, Burning for burning, \r\n           wound for wound, stripe for stripe.. \r\n          Jennifer looks up. \r\n\r\n                          JENNIFER \r\n           Forgive me father, for I will sin. \r\n\r\n          76 EST. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER - DAY 76\r\n          Andy and Stanley make their way to the falls. They carry\r\n          flashlights, but they're turned off as day has broken.\r\n          Stanley shovels pork rinds into his mouth, and offers some to\r\n          Andy. They are tired, weary, and you get the sense they have\r\n          been looking all night.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          You want some? My last bag.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          No, get that shit out of my face.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          What's your problem?\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          I'm tired, I'm hungry--\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          I offered you--\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          I don't want that shit. I want\r\n          real food, I want my bed, I want\r\n          this bullshit to be over.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Well the sooner we find Matthew... \r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Yeah, that's right.

We drag that homo \r\n          back to the sheriff, he's a dead\r\n          man.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          So what?

Stanley heads around into the woods,\r\n          Andy heads the other way.\r\n\r\n          77 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WOODS - DAY 77\r\n\r\n          We're with Stanley as he walks further into the woods, his\r\n          eyes scan in all directions... but there is nothing there.\r\n\r\n          78 EXT. HENDERSONVILLE RIVER, WATERLINE - DAY 78\r\n\r\n          We're with Andy as he walks the waterline.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Matthew?!\r\n          Then, Andy notices an uneven ripple in the water. He thinks\r\n          nothing of it... until it happens again.\r\n          This catches his eye. Slowly he makes his way over. The\r\n          water has calmed now, but still, Andy has a sense that\r\n          something is not right.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          Matthew!\r\n          As he gets close to the water - he now sees his reflection...\r\n          He squints his eyes trying to get a better look at what is\r\n          beneath the surface --\r\n          WHOOSH! SOMETHING runs right behind his back - the entire\r\n          reflection caught in the water --\r\n          Andy spins around - as he staggers into the water - no one is\r\n          there... nothing.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 74A.\r\n          just the calm breeze through the trees -- but then a small\r\n          outcrop of bushes rustle as if something just moved through.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 75.\r\n          Andy calms - then makes his way over with purpose-\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          Only making it worse for yourself,\r\n          Matt.\r\n          Andy picks up his pace as he nears the tree line - right\r\n          where he saw the movement.\r\n          Out of the corner of his eye, he sees another branch swinging\r\n          unnaturally. He races over--\r\n          CLOSER: He can actually hear breathing - it's getting louder-\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          Matthew?-\r\n\r\n          STANLEY JUMPS OUT--\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Boo!\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Jesus! You bastard!\r\n          Stanley laughs so hard he starts to cough -- Just as they're\r\n          about to continue on - the sound of a harmonica breaks\r\n          through. The same eerie tune.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          What the--?\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Prick's playing your song.\r\n          He looks at Stanley.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          The hell with the Sheriff, I'm\r\n          gonna kill him myself... MATTHEW!!\r\n\r\n          79 EXT. WOODS - DAY 79\r\n\r\n          Andy and Stanley run through the woods, trying to find the\r\n          source of the sound.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          You're ass is grass Matthew!! \r\n          Branches and leaves fly by as Andy barrels through the\r\n          foliage. Stanley tries to keep up, but it's no use.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 76.\r\n          The SOUND changes direction - they look off to see SOMEONE\r\n          flash through the trees.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY (CONT'D)\r\n          There he is. That way!\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Matthew! You're a dead man!\r\n          They race off after the sound.\r\n\r\n          80 EXT. WOODS - DAY 80 \r\n\r\n          They continue on - Stanley doesn't look too good.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Don't you pass out on me. I ain't\r\n          dragging your ass back.\r\n          Suddenly, the tune stops. Andy stops in his tracks, trying\r\n          to figure out which way to proceed. Suddenly, Stanley hears\r\n          another sound. Crying.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Hear that?\r\n          They're off again. About fifty yards away, hidden behind the\r\n          trees, is the SHACK. Something slips around the side of the\r\n          structure. Stanley immediately spots what he thinks is\r\n          Matthew.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Matthew!\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          He's in there all right.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Good, cause he's coming out in pieces.\r\n          Andy races ahead leaving Stanley trying to catch his breath\r\n          behind him.\r\n\r\n          81 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 81\r\n\r\n          Andy enters. The shack appears as we first saw it, only now\r\n          there are remnants of recent life.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n          Matthew! Where the fuck are you!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77.\r\n          Under the table is a pile of filthy old clothes. It almost\r\n          looks like... a makeshift pillow.\r\n          He picks up a moldy tin can which once contained some\r\n          preserved meal. He tosses it to the ground.\r\n\r\n          82 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 82 \r\n\r\n          Stanley waddles out the back of the shack. He stops. About\r\n          twenty yards away and sees JENNIFER leaning against a tree.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Why you little bitch...\r\n          Stanley races over - Just as Stanley gets close - SNAP!! A\r\n          hidden BEAR TRAP clamps down on Stanley's leg - the pain is\r\n          intense as he screams out - He staggers backwards and falls\r\n          to the ground in agony\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh, God! Oh, my fucking God!\r\n          ON ANDY: As he exits the Shack to see Stanley on the ground\r\n          writhing in pain.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Please! Andy! My fucking leg!\r\n          Andy races over to assist him. As he offers Stanley his\r\n          hand, he notices Stanley's eyes catching a glimpse of someone\r\n          behind him. But as soon as he turns, the wooden BAT, the one\r\n          from the fishing hole, catches him flush across the face!\r\n          He's down and before Stanley knows it she cracks him in the\r\n          back of the head.\r\n\r\n                         TO BLACK:\r\n\r\n          BACK IN ON:\r\n\r\n          83 INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY 83\r\n\r\n           Andy's eyes flicker open. He sees a hand wrapping a rusty \r\n           wire around the contact of an old car battery. Then he looks \r\n           up and sees a bare light bulb flicker on. \r\n          He's draped lengthwise over a horse trough so his torso is\r\n          completely over the basin. His arms and legs are secured\r\n          with ropes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 77A.\r\n          Suddenly, the sound of RUSHING WATER from inside the trough.\r\n          Andy looks down. A dirty hose hangs over the mouth of the\r\n          trough. Brown water flows from it... Filling it.\r\n\r\n                         ANDY\r\n\r\n                         (PAINED SCREAMS)\r\n          Help! Somebody! Help me!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 78.\r\n          His nose and face are busted - it hurts to scream.\r\n          With the trough filling up quickly, Andy realizes it won't be\r\n          long until the water is above his head.\r\n          He cranes his neck upwards. After all, were he to stay face\r\n          down, he would drown -- just like Jennifer would've.\r\n\r\n          84 EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE DAY 84\r\n\r\n          STANLEY'S POV: It's Jennifer and in her hand is his video\r\n          camera.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          I know. You like to watch. Don't\r\n          you. Don't you worry, I'll give \r\n          you quite a show.\r\n          She sets the camera on top of a tri-pod right in front of his\r\n          face, frames up and hits record. She looks up to him.\r\n          Stanley's arms are tied behind a tree, his head is held in\r\n          position, duct tapped back against the tree.\r\n          His legs are anchored to the ground. The bloody mangled one\r\n          still in the bear trap that bites and gnaws at his leg with\r\n          every move.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          Since you like to watch.\r\n          She flips the monitor of the camera toward him just like he\r\n          did to her.\r\n          She stands in front of Stanley's face. Stanley wants to say\r\n          something but his pain is too intense.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D) \r\n          Can't talk, can you? Well, maybe\r\n          it's because you're hungry.\r\n          Jennifer goes to grabs something behind her.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER (CONT'D)\r\n          You know, you have to eat some real\r\n          nasty shit out here to stay alive.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Bbbb... bitch! Let me go!\r\n          She grabs his nose and pulls open his mouth shoving a MAGGOT\r\n          INFESTED RODENT into his mouth.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          ISOYG PINK 10/29/09 79.\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n          What's wrong, you don't like it? I\r\n          prefer the maggots to the meat.\r\n          Jennifer site down next to Stanley. She glances over to the\r\n          monitor to see what he is looking at. Then she reaches over\r\n          and into a burlap sack.\r\n          Stanley stares straight ahead, at the monitor in front of\r\n          him.\r\n          Jennifer reaches into the burlap bag and takes out a roll of\r\n          fishing line. Then she takes out a pack of fish hooks.\r\n          Stanley's eyes go wide.\r\n          Jennifer removes the hooks from their package. She holds one\r\n          between her thumb and forefinger and studies the barbed tip.\r\n          Smiling to herself, she threads the hooks with fishing line.\r\n\r\n                         STANLEY\r\n          Wh...what are you doing with that?\r\n\r\n                         JENNIFER\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          Oh... just some fishing.

And Johnny, being Johnny, doesn't need much.\r\n          Johnny is close enough to touch her. He snickers a bit,\r\n          never taking his eyes off her ass.\r\n\r\n                         JOHNNY\r\n          Can I fill it up for you, ma'am?\r\n          The woman wears sunglasses and slowly turns to Johnny.\r\n          Johnny takes a long look from bottom to top - and when he\r\n          gets to her face - it registers - but before he can do\r\n          anything, Jennifer swings a tire iron and catches him right\r\n          across the jaw.\r\n          A handful of teeth, ejected by a spurt of fresh blood as\r\n          Johnny falls face-first into the ground.\r\n\r\n          88 INT.

His hands are tied tightly together\r\n          and pulled above his head, running through an eye hook that\r\n          has been screwed into one of the shack's wooden beams.
