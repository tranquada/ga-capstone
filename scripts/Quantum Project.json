THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n            Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes\n            against his body.  He sits down on the bed.  Sees a clock.  5:00 a.m. \n            TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. \n            VOICES rise from the parking lot.  \n\n            Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved\n            plaster ceiling.  Suddenly, floating up through the open window:  \n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE\n                      What do you want?!  \n\n            Pentcho cranes his head.\n\n                                WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n                      Tell me!  Now!  Now!  \n\n            The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him,\n            only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a\n            giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous\n            GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. \n            His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the\n\n            FRONT DOORBELL RINGS\n\n            He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs.  \n\n     53     INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT                             53\n\n            Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to:\n\n     54     INT.  THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT              54\n\n            Pentcho arrives.  He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her.  \n\n                                ALEXANDER\n                      Guess who's coming to dinner.\n\n            Mia jumps right in.  To Pentcho:\n\n                                MIA\n                      I didn't want to leave things the way we\n                      did.  Not this time.\n\n                                PENTCHO\n                      Wait.  I want to tell you something.\n\n            He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living\n            room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL.\n\n                                MIA\n                      I've been dreaming about this.\n\n                                PENTCHO\n                          (excited)\n                      Then you get it.  You'll understand.\n\n                                MIA\n                      What?\n\n            His face has the look of the little boy who has just stumbled upon\n            the pirate's treasure.  \n\n                                PENTCHO\n                      I know what I want.  I let go, and a second\n                      later you materialized at the door.  You\n                      see?  \n\n            CLOSE ON PENTCHO\n\n            feeling the feelings.\n\n                                PENTCHO (CONT'D)\n                      Mia.  I can create reality.  (beat) I can\n                      choose to love you with all my heart.  \n\n            Tears pool along the rims of her eyes.  She stares straight at him,\n            hiding nothing.\n\n                                MIA\n                      You know those people who won't be\n                      photographed because they're afraid you're\n                      stealing their souls...?  \n                          (long beat)\n                      I came to take back my picture.  The one I\n                      keep leaving with you.\n\n            His heart deflates.  His voice follows.  Barely audible:\n\n                                PENTCHO\n                      Why?\n\n                                MIA\n                      So I can move on.  You too.\n\n            A horn blares from outside.\n\n                                MIA (CONT'D)\n                      Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. \n                      I do.\n\n            She turns and runs out the front door.\n\n     55     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT         55\n\n            Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the\n            passenger door of the red Durango.\n\n                                MIA'S VOICE\n                      I'll drive.\n\n            She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel.  Will gets in his\n            side.  \n\n            ON THE FRONT PORCH\n\n            Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door.  Alexander's already\n            outside, watching Mia motor off.  He turns, stares at his son.\n\n                                ALEXANDER\n                      Do you want to think about it some more?  \n\n            PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB.  Jumps into the Beetle.  The\n            headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night.\n\n     56     INT.  THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT                     56\n\n            Mia grips the wheel with two hands.  Will feigns nonchalance. \n\n                                WILL\n                      You okay?\n\n            She nods.  Barely.  They merge onto the highway. \n\n     57     INT.  THE BEETLE (DRIVING) - NIGHT                      57\n\n            Pentcho grips the wheel.  Eyes focused.  We surge into \n\n     58     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN FIELD - OPENING ON                58\n\n            PEARLS, PLAYING OUT, LOOPING INTO A STRING \n\n            whose shape recalls the original brain field.  Thought text scrolls\n            below, accompanied now by Pentcho's own inner voice.\n\n                                VOICE AND TEXT\n                      Each part of physical reality is constructed\n                      of all the other parts...\n\n            EXTREME CLOSE-UP, ON A SINGLE PEARL\n\n            inside of which, the entire strand is reflected.\n\n                                VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D)\n                      A web of connections created by the\n                      interdependence of all things...\n\n            The field collapses back into:\n\n     59     INT.

One\n            beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her\n            for a split second.  She blinks.  Gasps to herself as the beam seems\n            to \n\n            LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR \n\n            and train its phosphorescent glow on:\n\n            MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP\n\n            the point of light reflecting out of her pupils.

The beam is gone.  She looks over at WILL,\n            oblivious, checking his watch. \n\n            BACK ON MIA\n\n            the understanding flooding her eyes as \n\n            SHE SNAPS HER HEAD BACK (JUST LIKE PENTCHO THE GUNFIGHTER)\n\n            And we see her making her move from FOUR DIFFERENT CAMERA ANGLES,\n            from her left, right, up above, and from the back seat of the car as\n            the RUMBLE OF A MEGA-EARTHQUAKE WHOOSHES BY...\n\n            POV MIA: THE BRIDGE, THE CARS, THE BAY\n\n            all sucked out of existence until nothing remains but         \n\n            THE VOID.

Suddenly, tiny sparks\n            of light GLOW and JUMP from portions of the bridge cable.\n\n            SLOW MOTION: PENTCHO AND MIA\n\n            gliding still closer.
