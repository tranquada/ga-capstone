Help him to\n\t\tleave these troubles behind.\n\t\tOtherwise, he'll never be able to\n\t\tstart anew.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tAll right.

Li Mu Bai and I\n\t\taren't cowards.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tWhen it comes to emotions, even\n\t\tgreat heroes can be idiots.  Tell\n\t\tme if Li Mu Bai is not more open\n\t\tthe next time you see him.  I'll\n\t\tgive him an earful!\n\nINT.

And the blade\n\t\tis no ordinary metal.  Still, the\n\t\tsword is the lightest of weapons.\n\t\tYou're just not used to handling it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tBut I have had much practice.  As a\n\t\tchild in the West, a platoon lived\n\t\twith us.  They'd let me play with\n\t\ttheir weapons.  The scabbard is so\n\t\tbeautiful.\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tBeautiful but dangerous.  Once you\n\t\tsee it tainted with blood, its\n\t\tbeauty is hard to admire.  It's 400\n\t\tyears old.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tExquisite!  You said it belongs to...\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tMy friend Li Mu Bai.  He's given it\n\t\tto Sir Te as a gift.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tLi Mu Bai!

An eerie sound\nresonates within the study.  Jen is even more impressed.\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tYes, I am.  But I prefer the\n\t\tmachete.  Certain moves, however,\n\t\tcall for a sword.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tReally?\n\nYu puts the sword back in the case.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\t\t(longingly)\n\t\tIt must be exciting to be a fighter,\n\t\tto be totally free!\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tFighters have rules too: friendship,\n\t\ttrust, integrity... Without rules,\n\t\twe wouldn't survive for long.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tI've read all about people like you.\n\t\tRoaming wild, beating up anyone who\n\t\tgets in your way!\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tWriters wouldn't sell many books if\n\t\tthey told how it really is.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tBut you're just like the characters\n\t\tin the stories.\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tSure.  No place to bathe for days,\n\t\tsleeping in flea-infested beds...\n\t\tThey tell you all about that in\n\t\tthose books?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tYou know what I mean.  I'm getting\n\t\tmarried soon, but I haven't lived\n\t\tthe life I want.\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tSo I heard.  Congratulations.  It's\n\t\tthe most important step in a\n\t\twoman's life, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tYou're not married, are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tNo!  You couldn't roam around\n\t\tfreely if you were.\n\n\t\t\t\tYU\n\t\tYou're probably right.\n\nYu studies Jen.  The room falls silent for a moment.\n\nEXT. SIDE COURT YARD - DAY\n\nIt's dusk and the sky is beautiful orange and purple.  Jen\nis leaving the study escorted by her maid.  She turns to Yu\nfor a final good-bye.

TE'S STUDY - NIGHT\n\nSir Te hands the sword to Governor Yu.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tGo ahead, Governor Yu.\n\nGovernor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the\nsword.  He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword.\nTe snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword\nout from its sheath.  The sword gives off a luminous blue\nglow in the dark.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tTwo feet 9 inches long.  1 inch\n\t\twide.  The handle is 1 inch deep,\n\t\t2.6 inches wide.  Seven-tenths of\n\t\tan inch thick.  With seven rubies\n\t\tmissing from the hilt.  You can\n\t\ttell the design dates back to\n\t\tbefore the Chin era.  Engraved with\n\t\ta technique lost by the time of the\n\t\tHan Dynasty.\n\n\t\t\t\tGOVERNOR YU\n\t\tYour knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tA sword by itself rules nothing.\n\t\tIt comes alive only through skillful\n\t\tmanipulation.\n\n\t\t\t\tGOVERNOR YU\n\t\tI see your point.  Please continue.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIR TE\n\t\tThe Imperial Court isn't the\n\t\tproblem.  With royalty and officials\n\t\teverywhere, the Royal Guard keeps\n\t\tsecurity tight.  But Peking is not\n\t\tlike the West.  Here, you'll find\n\t\tall sorts of characters.  Proceed\n\t\twith caution in your quest for law\n\t\tand order.  Don't depend only on\n\t\tthe court.  Contacts in the Giang\n\t\tHu underworld can ensure your\n\t\tposition.  Be strong, yet supple.\n\t\tThis is the way to rule.\n\nINT. JEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA maid warms her hands in a basin of hot water for Jen, then\nwalks over to Jen and helps remove her earrings.

Miss has grown up,\n\t\tand is getting married soon.  God\n\t\tknows what the future will bring.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tIt will be just the same.

DESERT BLUFF - DAY\n\nA group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up,\nkeeping a respectable distance.  They notice her and rise as\nshe dismounts.\n\nOne of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few\nfeet away.\n\nIn a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and\nknocked his nose into his face.

She sits up with a start and checks her clothes.\nLooking around, she realizes she's in a cave.  Next to her\nare a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp\narrows.  She quickly grabs one of the arrows.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tIf you like that arrow, I can make\n\t\tyou a bow.  Great for hunting wild\n\t\tchicken.  They're delicious.\n\nJen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but\nher legs betray her and she falls.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tYou need to eat, understand?  Then\n\t\tyou'll have the strength to fight.\n\t\tUnderstand?\n\nHe helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac.\nHe hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts\ngrudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she\nstarts to wolf it down.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tYou're eating too fast.

What's your name?\n\nJen spits at Lo.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tI didn't think the Hans had names\n\t\tlike that.\n\nLater: She weaves in and out of consciousness.  In the\nflickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.\n\nLater, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift\nbathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.\n\nHe rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and\ndishevelled body.  He comes over and unties her.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tRelax.  If I had wanted to, I would\n\t\talready have done it.  You must be\n\t\tdying for a bath.  Fresh water's\n\t\thard to get here.

After the\n\t\tbath, you'll be calmer.\n\nJen nods and the bandit releases her.  He starts to sing as\nhe walks out.  Jen waits until the sound recedes before\nclosing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit.\nWhile she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud\nrendition of a tribal song.  Lo apparently doesn't remember\nall the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few\npassages.  Jen smiles.\n\nINT. CAVE - NIGHT\n\nJen grimaces as Lo pulls the last of some cactus needles\nfrom the soles of her feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tLO\n\t\tNo more hitting on the head!

Furious, Lo lunges at her and\nthey tussle briefly.  Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and\nthe scuffling becomes more like foreplay.  Violence turns\ninto unleashed passion.\n\nEXT.

Her white clothes are now stained\nwith blood and mud.  The wind had picked up and every breeze\nsounds like an air attack by Li.\n\nThe two leap onto the tips of the bamboo trees and begin\ntheir dances and dodges.  They glance off bamboos and each\nother while staying afloat.  Finally Jen lands on the same\nstick of bamboo as Li.  The two hold their positions for a\nwhile, as the bamboo bends.\n\n\t\t\t\tLI\n\t\tI only let you go because I wanted\n\t\tto see the real you.\n\nJen tries to shake Li off the bamboo but Li recovers nicely.\n\n\t\t\t\tJEN\n\t\tWhat do you know about a true heart?\n\nLi suddenly leaps off the bamboo tree.

He follows Jen downstream by\nhopping from one rock to another.  Jen recovers the sword\nbut is herself drowning.  Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the\nrapids and fishes Jen out.  Jade Fox carries the unconscious\nJen away.  Li gives chase, but loses them.\n\nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY\n\nIt's raining.  Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine\npaste and then dips a needle in the paste.  She burns the\nneedle point, causing a blue smoke.  She lights some incense\nand puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.\n\n\t\t\t\tFOX\n\t\tSooner or later, they'd drag you\n\t\tback to Peking.  Your parents will\n\t\tnever accept you again.  But why go\n\t\thome?  We've gone this far, we\n\t\twon't stop now.  You'll always be\n\t\tmy lady.  At last, we'll be our own\n\t\tmasters.

Looking out, she sees\nJade Fox in the distance.\n\nINT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY\n\nJen wakes up, flushed from fever.  She takes a sip from a\ncup of water -- it's empty.  She tosses the cup, gets up,\nand walks into the rain.\n\nEXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY\n\nJen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the\nraindrops.
