COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING\r\n\r\n    A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,\r\n    makes its way along a stretch of motorway.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING\r\n\r\n    At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes\r\n    closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the\r\n    bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He\r\n    pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play\r\n    on his MP3.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   INT. COACH. MORNING\r\n\r\n    Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff\r\n    face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,\r\n    Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music\r\n    from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's \"Brighter Day\",\r\n    a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and\r\n    comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.\r\n\r\n    The track will play over the following opening scenes, the\r\n    credits fading subtly in and out in white text.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   EXT. STREET. MORNING\r\n\r\n    We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent\r\n    through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to\r\n    house the east end after the Second World War.\r\n\r\n                                                      CUT TO:\r\n\r\n    We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through\r\n    those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.\r\n\r\n                            SHIFTY\r\n\r\n    Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a\r\n    fence, making a short cut.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING\r\n\r\n    Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,\r\n    pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,\r\n    holding his nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n    SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST\r\n    CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.\r\n                                                            2.\r\n\r\n6    INT. COACH. MORNING.\r\n\r\n     Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on\r\n     his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just\r\n     catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of\r\n     cocaine onto a clean glass table.\r\n\r\n\r\n8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white\r\n     dressing gown, prepares breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping\r\n     over a fence at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.\r\n\r\n\r\n11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n     In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He\r\n     climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real\r\n     enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n12   INT. COACH. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same\r\n     strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.\r\n\r\n\r\n14   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His\r\n     mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.\r\n                                                           3.\r\n\r\n15   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n16   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING\r\n\r\n     The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his\r\n     shoulder.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n     He turns and walks off.\r\n\r\n\r\n17   TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his\r\n     face, he seems a little more with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n18   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one\r\n     half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n19   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.\r\n\r\n\r\n20   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY\r\n\r\n     Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his\r\n     shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.\r\n\r\n\r\n21   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes\r\n     it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.\r\n\r\n\r\n22   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNING\r\n\r\n     Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n23   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad\r\n     facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine\r\n     mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the\r\n     rush.\r\n                                                           4.\r\n\r\n24   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of\r\n     paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He\r\n     stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our\r\n     soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head\r\n     phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.\r\n\r\n\r\n25   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears\r\n     the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts\r\n     it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Fucking hell, man...\r\n\r\n     Shifty can't help but smile.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)\r\n               You're early!\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               Shifty.\r\n\r\n     A smile creeps across Chris' face.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Yes, rude boy.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               You alright geezer.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               I'm sweet... come in, man, come in.\r\n\r\n     Shifty and Chris embrace.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               Good to see you, mate.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Good to see you too, geezer.\r\n\r\n\r\n26   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING\r\n\r\n\r\n     CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP.\r\n\r\n     Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag\r\n     perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.\r\n                                                           5.\r\n\r\n27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING\r\n\r\n     Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and\r\n     pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New\r\n     DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,\r\n     lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,\r\n     books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked\r\n     pile of mobile phone bills with the word \"PAID\" scribed\r\n     across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of\r\n     Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning\r\n     sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He\r\n     stands, staring.\r\n\r\n\r\n28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING\r\n\r\n     Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast\r\n     ready. Shifty turns to face him.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               You alright son?\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               Yeah I just needed to splash my\r\n               face, freshen up a bit.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Have you slept?\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               Did I fuck.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Mate, neither have I...

We hear someone moving\r\nabout upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,\r\nopens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large\r\nbag of sweet corn.\r\n\r\n                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)\r\n          I've got a few things to do today\r\n          geezer, you can stay here if you\r\n          want, just chill out.\r\n\r\nHe rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out\r\ntightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places\r\nthem in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty\r\nclosely, but doesn't say anything.\r\n                                                           7.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)\r\n               Or you can come with me?\r\n\r\n                           CHRIS\r\n               Whatever.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS (CONT'D)\r\n                   (whispers)\r\n               Does your brother know you keep\r\n               those there?\r\n\r\n     Shifty shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS (CONT'D)\r\n                   (Whispering)\r\n               You not worried?\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Mate, he doesn't eat vegetables.\r\n\r\n     Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WE STAY ON CHRIS' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY (O.S.)

MORNING\r\n\r\n     We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and\r\n     walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old\r\n     boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth\r\n     Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl\r\n     eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst\r\n     talking on the phone.\r\n\r\n                           JASMINE\r\n                     (on phone)\r\n               ... she's living like a drifter babe,\r\n               I'm telling you, she's split... sort\r\n               of... with Stefan...

His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.\r\n                                                            8.\r\n\r\n                           JASMINE (CONT'D)\r\n                     (on phone)\r\n               ...Neither knows about the other, and\r\n               then she expects me (she drops to a\r\n               whisper) to fucking cover for her\r\n               (normal volume) Stefan's my mate\r\n               for Christ's sake, I'm not getting\r\n               caught up in that whole mess (to\r\n               boy) Freddie, sit down and finish\r\n               your breakfast!\r\n\r\n     This is too much for Trevor.

He stares at the\r\n     emblem of the cat.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Fucking cat lovers.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               I can't stand people who feed their\r\n               cat's... fucking red snapper... or\r\n               goose liver, because they say the\r\n               fucking things fussy...\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS (CONT'D)\r\n               ...it's a fucking cat.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Wait until you see this...\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n                                                                    *\r\n               Starve the fucking thing for a week\r\n               and it'll eat a condom, do you know\r\n               what I mean...\r\n\r\n     Shifty laughs. Then they stand for a second waiting. Shifty\r\n     knocks again.\r\n\r\n                            SHIFTY\r\n               C'mon Val.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)\r\n               Sorry about this geez.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               Mate, it's cool.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               I didn't wanna drag you around all\r\n               day.\r\n                                                          32.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n     Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a\r\n     shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps,\r\n     echoing down the clinical looking hallway.\r\n\r\n\r\n69                                                                  *\r\n     INT. VALERIE'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAY\r\n\r\n     We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and\r\n     colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller.\r\n     We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the\r\n     first time. At 5'5\" with long arms book-ended by bony hands\r\n     and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is\r\n     clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping\r\n     cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n     Valerie looks towards Chris.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm,\r\n               he's an old friend of mine, we grew\r\n               up together. He's cool. We go way\r\n               back. So it's cool, you know.\r\n\r\n                         CHRIS\r\n               How you doing?\r\n\r\n     He offers a hand that she takes politely.\r\n\r\n                           VALERIE\r\n               Yeah. Hi.\r\n\r\n     A moment of uncomfortable silence.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               I called yesterday but you were\r\n               out.\r\n\r\n                           VALERIE\r\n               When?\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               I dunno, It was probably about two\r\n               in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               I was in all day.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               You must have been asleep.\r\n                                                          33.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               No, no I was awake, I didn't sleep.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               I dunno then.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               Did you say two o'clock.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               Are you sure it wasn't two thirty.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               It may have been.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               I was out on the balcony at two\r\n               thirty.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE (CONT'D)\r\n               But I was in here at two.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE (CONT'D)\r\n               I'll make us some tea.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Yeah, that'll be sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n70                                                                   *\r\n     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY\r\n\r\n     Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front\r\n     room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks\r\n     up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days,\r\n     fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He\r\n     looks slightly shocked to see this.\r\n\r\n                                                       CUT TO:\r\n\r\n     Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room.\r\n     He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves\r\n     his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not\r\n     moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all\r\n     the cats in the room are stuffed.\r\n                                                          34.\r\n\r\n     Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the\r\n     deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the\r\n     wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat\r\n     ornaments rattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n71                                                                   *\r\n     INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY\r\n\r\n     Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the\r\n     counter top.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               How you been, alright.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               Yeah, I'm alright babe, you\r\n               alright?\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Yeah, I'm alright.\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               Good, good.\r\n\r\n     Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               She visited you yet?\r\n\r\n                         VALERIE\r\n               No... not for a long time,\r\n               Shifty... not seen her for a long\r\n               time really, darling.\r\n\r\n     Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the\r\n     tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He\r\n     places a hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               She'll come back one day.\r\n\r\n     They carry on making the tea.\r\n\r\n\r\n72                                                                   *\r\n     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY\r\n\r\n     The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A\r\n     fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink.\r\n     Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before\r\n     Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what\r\n     he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small\r\n     yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a\r\n     smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments\r\n     falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie\r\n     walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully\r\n     back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by\r\n     the music.\r\n                                                           35.\r\n\r\n      We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to\r\n      her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her\r\n      lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.\r\n\r\n                          CHRIS\r\n                No, no, I'm fine......thanks\r\n                though.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CLOSE ON SHIFTY.\r\n\r\n                          SHIFTY\r\n                Look Val we're gonna have to do\r\n                one...\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO\r\n      SHIFTY...\r\n\r\n      Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding\r\n      bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly\r\n      unsettled by what he's seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n73                                                                    *\r\n      EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE'S FLAT. DAY\r\n\r\n      Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to\r\n      walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He\r\n      pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried\r\n      on walking.\r\n\r\n                          SHIFTY\r\n                Geezer, give me a minute.\r\n\r\n      Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his\r\n      jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to\r\n      unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n'\r\n      bass booming out.\r\n\r\n\r\n73A                                                                   *\r\n      INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY\r\n\r\n      Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark\r\n      hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty\r\n      peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -\r\n      a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the\r\n      hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal\r\n      a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays\r\n      out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,\r\n      Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the\r\n      films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,\r\n      cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to\r\n      the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just\r\n      staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.\r\n      Shifty stares him out.\r\n                                                          36.\r\n\r\n                                                                *\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Alright mate?\r\n\r\n                          OTIS\r\n               Alright.\r\n\r\n     Shifty looks about at the room.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               What's your name?\r\n\r\n                          OTIS\r\n               Otis.\r\n\r\n     A BEAT.\r\n\r\n                         SHIFTY\r\n               Where do you get your weed from?\r\n\r\n                         OTIS\r\n               It aint... it aint mine, my erm, my\r\n               mate left it, he left it here...

VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY\r\n\r\n     Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16,\r\n     pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened\r\n     by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.\r\n\r\n\r\n77   INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM.

Chris is fast but\r\n     Shifty's like a whippet.\r\n                                                          46.\r\n\r\n                            SHIFTY\r\n               Follow me.\r\n\r\n     Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n85   EXT.

The drop on the\r\n     other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor\r\n     hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY\r\n\r\n     Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the\r\n     crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are\r\n     near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag\r\n     whipping off the back.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE\r\n     CYCLE TRACK.\r\n\r\n     It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts\r\n     cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more\r\n     serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as\r\n     Shifty.\r\n\r\n\r\n88                                                                   *\r\n     EXT. GROSVENOR ROAD CUT THRU.
