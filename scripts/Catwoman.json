CAMERA MOVES to reveal\n<br/>the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other\n<br/>images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do --\n<br/>REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps\n<br/>cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple.\n<br/>At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi-\n<br/>circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP,\n<br/>others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now\n<br/>hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a\n<br/>RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered\n<br/>columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a\n<br/>hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>SUPERIMPOSE:   \"496 B.C.\"\n<br/></b>\n<br/>WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into\n<br/>the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the\n<br/>brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT\n<br/></b>\n<br/>The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that\n<br/>mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the\n<br/>next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into\n<br/>golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her\n<br/>goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN\n<br/>SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching\n<br/>this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim,\n<br/>elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on\n<br/>its head.\n<br/>\n<br/><b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>                                                      2.\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>CONTINUED:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>THE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing\n<br/>CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS.\n<br/>THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from\n<br/>niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way,\n<br/>moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers...\n<br/>ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open.\n<br/>THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They\n<br/>grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else.\n<br/>At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of\n<br/>the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their\n<br/>swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty.\n<br/>An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere\n<br/>high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking\n<br/>around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls,\n<br/>from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons,\n<br/>clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them,\n<br/>DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility.\n<br/>STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The\n<br/>torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the\n<br/>statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift\n<br/>SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of\n<br/>the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat.\n<br/>MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as\n<br/>they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU\n<br/>takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks\n<br/>through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on --\n<br/>\n<br/><b>                                                           CUT TO:\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>A ROOFTOP\n<br/></b>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>We hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC.

She's cautious, eager\n<br/>to please, to do what's expected of her\n<br/>-- a bit of a doormat.\n<br/>Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of\n<br/>paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as\n<br/>if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles.\n<br/>THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/><b>EXT.

Patience jumps up again\n<br/>quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time\n<br/>managing to hold her balance.\n<br/>MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's\n<br/>like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps\n<br/>become more confident.
