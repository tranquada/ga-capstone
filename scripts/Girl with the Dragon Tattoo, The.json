Sticks of furniture.\r\n      Old water-stained books strewn around.

Mickey Spillane,\r\n      a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about\r\n      the USSR, a children's book.

Crawls desperately\r\n      around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody\r\n      but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and\r\n      finds the blood is coming from his forehead.\r\n      He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he\r\n      could it would mean they were walking toward him, which\r\n      would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank.\r\n      He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind\r\n      him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a\r\n      clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice -\r\n\r\n      He runs for the trees.

Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his\r\n      elbows and toes like an infantryman.\r\n\r\n      Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he\r\n      looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait.\r\n<b>                                                               104.\r\n</b><b>                                                              104.\r\n</b>      \r\n\r\n<b>189   INT/EXT.
