It is presented \nout of order to reflect the final film.  \n\n\t\t\tEXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - 2000 - NIGHT\n\n            Dark night.  Most street lights shot out.  Just one or two of\n            the eerie vapor lights left on the block.\n\n            A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of\n            groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he\n            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the\n            street.\n\n            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of\n            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.\n\n            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. \n            Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out\n            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we\n            saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone.  He's still\n            faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes. \n            He stops in the light.\n\n            And we see it's SHOTGUN: 20 years of fear and loathing etched\n            on his face.  He freezes, listening for a second to the\n            crackheads wheezing mumbles - no - it's something else he's\n            listening for -- and hearing.\n\n            From behind him a low wheezy sound, like some huge panting\n            dog.  He stops.  And it stops.  He walks on and it follows:\n\n            As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears\n            strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily\n            following.\n\n            Suddenly, he hears that panting closer and closer until it's\n            nearly right behind him.  He starts running, though he hasn't\n            yet seen anything.  Only heard the mongrel hot on his heels.\n\n            FOLLOW WITH SHOTGUN\n\n            As he stumbles, careens, and wheezes through the streets and\n            alleys, terrified.  Winded, he eventually stops, his hand\n            trembling into his shopping bag, seeking a weapon.\n\n            And we see the building he's paused beside: Bones' place. \n            Pockmarked by age.  Like the face of some furious old man.\n\n            Now he can almost feel the dog's breath on the back of his\n            neck...Shotgun spins, whipping a bottle of milk out of the\n            bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him.\n\n            The bottle smashes against the wall of Bones' building.  For\n            a second, silhouetted against the now whited wall, the tall,\n            too tall, shape of the skinny black dog.\n\n            Without waiting to see what he hit, Shotgun takes off running\n            to reach his building across the street.  The sound of the\n            dog's nails skittering across the street right behind him --\n\n            -- and he just makes it --\n\n            INT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Inside, safe, panting for breath.  Then starts running up the\n            stairs...\n\n            EXT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            From outside his third floor window, we see Shotgun run into\n            his apartment, slam down his groceries on the counter, grab\n            an old rifle from under his bed and hurry to his open window.\n\n            INT. SHOTGUN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            He scan/aims out his window across the street to the now\n            desolate building where Bones once lived.  Finger on the\n            trigger, eyes scanning the shadows for the dog.  Mumbling\n            quotations from the Bible about canines, some of which are\n            handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors:\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      \"Thou shalt not bring a dog into the\n                      house of the Lord thy God, for they are\n                      an abomination.\"  Deuteronomy.\n\n            Suddenly, something moving on the empty street catches his\n            eye.\n\n            HIS ANGLE ON\n\n            The Black Dog emerging from the shadows in the street.  Our\n            first good look at the beast.  Long clawed paws, all teeth\n            and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasn't eaten in\n            20 years.\n\n            It's long black head seems almost to be throbbing, moving\n            from within, almost subliminally we see a weirder, demonic,\n            more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur... Or is it\n            just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps?\n\n                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n                          (as he aims his rifle)\n                      \"They return at evening: snarling like\n                      dogs and prowling the city...\" Psalms 59,\n                      vs. 6...\n\n            The dog stands in the pool of light, offering a perfect shot. \n            Shotgun smiles, aims, and then fires, making --\n\n            EXT. BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            -- a direct hit!  But the dog doesn't move.  Unfazed.  The\n            bullet must have missed.  Or else gone right through him.\n\n            The long-faced dog just looks up at Shotgun like it was\n            laughing at the fool.  And has been for years.\n\n            Shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter. \n            Shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible\n            necessitates, and finds a half-dozen boxes of rifle rounds.\n\n            He calmly reloads the rifle.  And the sound of another shot\n            echoes in the night over...\n\n            EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Two frat boys, JASON and PALMER, driving a too nice car in a\n            too bad part of town.  Palmer at the wheel while Jason makes\n            a call on the cellular.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Great.  Gun shots.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Just a backfire.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Like you'd know.  Face it.  We're lost.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Take a left, no, I mean a right.  Okay,\n                      stop for a second.\n\n            They stop in the middle of a block.  Jason on the phone.\n\n                                JASON (CONT'D)\n                      We're here.  Where the hell are you?\n\n                                STANK\n                          (on phone)\n                      Back here.  At the end of the block.\n\n            He turns around and sees behind them, TWO GUYS standing on\n            the far corner.  One's on the phone.\n\n                                STANK (CONT'D)\n                          (on phone)\n                      You got the cash?\n\n                                JASON\n                      You got the shit?\n\n                                STANK\n                          (on the phone)\n                      Yeah, but you got to come the rest of the\n                      way on foot.  Leave your car and walk\n                      over here.\n\n            EXT. STREET - SAME\n\n            They exit the car, looking all around them with more than a\n            touch of paranoia.\n\n            As they walk nervously down the block, they join the two on\n            the corner.  It's STANK and WEAZE, both 17.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Let me see it.\n\n                                STANK\n                      Let me see it.\n\n                                JASON\n                          (hands him the money)\n                      Where is it?\n\n                                STANK\n                      I can't carry it in my pocket, man.  And\n                      I can't go get it for you cause you might\n                      be a cop.  You gonna have to pick it up\n                      yourself.\n\n            Jason and Palmer aren't sure about this.  By the sphincteral\n            look on his face, Palmer would rather forget about it.\n\n                                STANK (CONT'D)\n                      Don't worry.  It's just round the corner. \n                      Halfway down that block, you can't miss\n                      it.  Top step of the front stairs,\n                      there's a loose stone.  Go on, I ain't\n                      shitting you.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Fuck it.  Alright.\n\n            EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - CONTINUOUS\n\n            They walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at\n            least half the lots burnt out.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Is it too late for me to officially\n                      register my growing certainty that this\n                      is an extremely bad idea?\n\n            Farther down, in the center of one side of the street, stands\n            a particularly ominous abandoned building.  Bones' building.\n\n            Jason ignites a Zippo, and they see one loose brick.  Jason\n            pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Easy as pie.  And twice as tasty.\n\n            He opens the bag.  It's filled with rock cocaine.\n\n            ANGLE - ACROSS THE STREET\n\n            On the third floor, Shotgun sits in his straight-backed chair\n            in front of the open center window drinking coffee, cradling\n            his rifle on his lap.  Sees the frat boys picking up their\n            shit.  Then he looks out at Bone's 'tomb':\n\n            Dark blank windows staring back at him; the building's front\n            door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces\n            missing, looking almost like a jack-o-lantern's grin.\n\n            Shotgun then looks back down at the boys below.  From behind\n            them they hear their car alarm go off.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Someone's screwing with the car!\n\n            But from the other way come cops, in a plain wrap car, a hand\n            reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof. \n            No place to run.  No place to hide for the boys.  They reach\n            for the door of the shuttered building -- and it opens!\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      Yo.  You two, get the hell away from\n                      there!\n\n            But they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside\n            the gaping maw of Bones' building.\n\n            Shotgun shakes his head sitting back down, cradling his\n            rifle.\n\n                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n                      Fools.\n\n\tINT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Inside, the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door,\n            waiting for the cops to pass.\n\n            The boys look around the decayed Gothic interior lit only by\n            the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside.\n\n            What we last saw as the ornate 70's luxury lobby in Bones'\n            day, is now  a horror show.\n\n            Walls torn and stained.  Mold grows in patches on the wall\n            and ceiling.  Huge cobwebs hang.  The furniture's all broken.\n\n            A gnawing tearing sound makes Palmer spin: a rat sticks its\n            head up through the rotted cushions of the couch.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Let's get the hell outta here.\n\n            Jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing\n            blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street.\n\n            From inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and\n            cop shoes walking.\n\n                                JASON\n                      Oh fuck, c'mon...\n\n            He gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase.  Palmer is\n            right behind him as they slip upstairs, deeper into the\n            gaping darkness of the abandoned building.\n\n            While below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices\n            penetrate the gloom.\n\n                                OLDER COP\n                      ...not going in there.  Waste o' time.\n\n                                YOUNGER COP\n                      I saw 'em go in.\n\n            And from the boys' high vantage point up the stairs we see\n            the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn.\n\n            WHILE INSIDE THE COP CAR - CLOSE ANGLE\n\n            All we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a wax-paper covered\n            pork chop sandwich.  The cop, face in shadow, brings the drip\n            ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face.\n\n            INSIDE BONES' BUILDING\n\n            The frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their\n            feet.  Jason slamming his hand over Palmer's mouth to keep\n            him from screaming.\n\n            DOWN BELOW\n\n            The young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room, and\n            shines his flashlight at the stairwell.\n\n            UPSTAIRS\n\n            Jason pulls the reluctant Palmer further up the stairs, to\n            the third floor as below them they hear the cop coming up.\n\n            Jason pulls Palmer through the nearest door and into:\n\n            INT. JIMMY BONES' OLD PAD - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The rotted remains of what was once Jimmy Bones' master\n            bedroom.  The room he was betrayed and slaughtered in.\n\n            DOWNSTAIRS\n\n            The cop begins to head up the stairs.  Visible behind him,\n            down through the open front door, is the plain wrap car.  The\n            older cop inside, mouth fulla sammich, loudly says:\n\n                                FAT OLDER COP\n                      Forget it!  No way they're in there. \n                      Trust me.  I've been working down here\n                      twenty years.  No one goes in there.\n\n            FROM THE FAT OLDER COP'S POV\n\n            We watch as the younger cop returns to the car, giving up. \n            And when he climbs in, we reverse and reveal who the older\n            cop is: LUPOVICH, the cop who helped kill Bones.\n\n            But he's decayed and expanded into a Hank Quinlan-like\n            mountain of corrupt cop flesh.  Too many pork chop\n            sandwiches.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Let's get the hell outta here.\n\n            INT. JIMMY'S OLD PAD - SAME\n\n            From upstairs, the boys see the blue light of the cop car\n            recede as the car pulls away down below.\n\n            Palmer reaches for the door.  He wants out.  But in the\n            darkness, he can't find the door.\n\n                                PALMER\n                      Gimme some light.\n\n            Behind Jason we see a shape, a shadow, a tall silhouette, a\n            man-shaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness.\n\n            Jason lights his lighter.  And in the flickering we see\n            behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell:\n\n            It's not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper,\n            or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror.\n\n            All surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which\n            we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people\n            were trapped on the surface of things.  Exactly like the\n            glimpse we had beneath the world when Jimmy died...\n\n            The floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it -- made\n            out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms\n            of dead souls.  Their faces, hollow pleading eyes and howling\n            mouths visible like flowing grain in wood.\n\n            And in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of\n            Bones, impossibly tall and thin, stretching malevolently out\n            across the room like a living shadow.\n\n            But the boys don't see this as they're finding the door.  We\n            see Bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble.\n\n            Palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling\n            growl from the darkness on the other side.  And in the open\n            door stands the black dog.\n\n            They boys jump back.  But breathes easy.\n\n                                PALMER (CONT'D)\n                      Just a dog...\n\n            And the black dog leaps up at them -- teeth flying right for\n            the boys' throats.  And in the flickering ghastly light we\n            see its demon face breaking through.\n\n            The dog sinks his long teeth into Jason's arm.  He flails and\n            drops his lighter, still lit, on the floor.\n\n            As soon as he does, the dog releases Jason, and disappears as\n            fast as it appeared, back into the darkness.\n\n            The two kids panic, Jason shaking and bleeding, looking\n            around, waiting for the dog or something else to attack,\n            seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell.\n\n            Behind them we see that tall man-shaped shadow.  The Bones\n            shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys, intent only on\n            the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where\n            it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall.\n\n            A thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to\n            catch on the chipped lead-filled flammable paint.\n\n            THE BOYS RUN\n\n            And stumble down the hall away from the horror, while back in\n            the room the Bones-shadow watches as the lighter flickers and\n            dies out.  Other than a slightly blackened spot, the wall is\n            unburned.\n\n            The black shadow shudders in rage, arches back and hooooowls\n            in frustration, its mouth abnormally large.  The shadowy head\n            snaps in the direction of the boys -- ready to vent it's\n            wrath, and for a subliminal second we see in the head, the\n            hellish face of Jimmy Bones.\n\n            The boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last\n            flight of stairs. \n            Jason's foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a\n            second, it appears as though rotten hands are just below the\n            stairs, grabbing at his foot and leg.\n\n            He yelps in terror, pulling his foot back as they continue\n            towards the front door, the Bones-thing's woofer-busting howl\n            roaring down from the third floor.\n\n            THE SHEER INFINITE ADRENALINE RUSH\n\n            Of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys\n            off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl\n            themselves out the front door into the night air... Jason\n            falling and lying on the stoop.\n\n            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Across the street, Shotgun sees the boys in the doorway. \n            Then, as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and\n            comes to life, the shadows created on Bones' building make it\n            look almost like a demonic face.\n\n            Gulping for air, laughing hysterically at their survival, the\n            frat boys pause.  Jason sits back on his butt, checking his\n            wound.  The doorway behind them just a black hole in space.\n\n                                PALMER\n                          (bumping fists together)\n                      Damn, bro.  That was close!\n\n            THEN SUDDENLY\n\n            Something - it happens so fast we're not sure just what grabs\n            sucks-pulls Palmer back into the black doorway hole.\n\n            Jason, still prone, tries to crawl away but whatever got his\n            friend now sucks him in too.  His fingernails scraping along\n            the stoop in frenzied desperation.\n\n            WITH SHOTGUN\n\n            When he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from\n            across the street, he leaps to his feet and tries to see into\n            the dark of the doorway across the street.  But he can only\n            hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas:\n\n            Moans and the sound of flesh torn, and swallowed, and their\n            last dying screams.\n\n            UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK\n\n            The screaming reverberates.  Faces appear in some windows. \n            While in others, shades are drawn and the lights go out...\n\n            BACK WITH SHOTGUN\n\n            Mumbling to himself:\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      \"For outside are dogs and sorcerers...\"\n                      Revelation 22, vs. 15.\n\n            Tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away.\n\n            LOOKING AT THE BUILDING\n\n            It still has the shadowy look/shape of Jimmy Bones, now\n            shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out\n            again, plunging the street into near darkness.  The body of\n            Palmer no longer visible below.\n\n            When he looks back, the building seems just an old building\n            again.  Then there's movement in an upper window, catching\n            his eye.  Shotgun sees the tall, shadowy silhouette.\n\n            The figure is elongated, can't tell if it is a man, or the\n            distorted shadow of a man.  It beckons to Shotgun.\n\n            SHOTGUN\n\n            Just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the\n            shadowy thing across the street could hear him.\n\n                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n                      You still mad?  Still want me?  Come on\n                      and get me.\n\n            THE SHADOW\n\n            Shakes its head.  As if it can hear him.  And again mutely\n            beckons to him.\n\n            ON SHOTGUN\n\n                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n                      Oh, right.  You can't.

His world.  Cool, handsome,\n            respected.  Dressed very fly, but not excessive.

Bones' old crib.\n\n            WITH BILL AND MAURICE\n\n            Behind them, barely subliminal glimpse - a manshaped darker\n            shadow within a shadow.  Bill feels a cold wind from nowhere. \n            And hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze.\n\n                                HOLLOW ECHOES\n                      It ain't eh money.

What you smokin'?\n\n            BELOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR\n\n            Tia's checking out a bedroom.  Hears a light tinkling in a\n            closet.  She opens it: empty except a row of rusty metal\n            hangers, holding the moldy remains of Bones old suits.\n\n            DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BASEMENT - PATRICK\n\n            Is there a flashlight, poking around.  Trying to find the\n            metal knob to turn on the gas.  Eerie as hell down there.\n\n            Out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving,\n            looming.  A scurrying sound and Patrick turns his flashlight\n            in the other direction: we glimpse a bloated rat.\n\n            Behind him, the shadow we glimpsed grows, elongates.  Patrick\n            notes another door.  This one padlocked.  Sensing someone or\n            something behind him, Patrick turns with the flashlight.\n\n            Nothing there.  But the Bones-shadow is behind him again. \n            Again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight\n            around: nothing.\n\n            Except the Bones-shadow is again...behind him.\n\n            Shaking it off, Patrick heads for the old heater, pulling out\n            matches to light the pilot as Bones-shadow stays behind him.\n\n            BONES POV\n\n            Bones watches as Patrick reaches around the gas heater.  When\n            Patrick strikes a match head, the Bones-shadow moves even\n            closer to him as Patrick reaches in and lights the pilot.\n\n            When Patrick steps back, Bones-shadow grows and stretches,\n            spreading like an ink stain, reaching across to where the\n            pilot flame flickers.\n\n            In profile, the shadow-mouth blows...but no breath comes out. \n            The flame doesn't even flicker.\n\n            Bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of\n            frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth,\n            bigger than any human mouth, howling within the shadow-face.\n\n            The sound echoes all through the basement rooms as Patrick\n            walks back upstairs.  He slaps a nearby plumbing pipe.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Go on old pipes, groan all you like. \n                      Just please don't burst.  That I can't\n                      afford.\n\n            FOLLOW WITH BONES POV\n\n            As disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace\n            pilot would do, he steps into the rusted remains of the old\n            elevator and the POV begins to levitate.\n\n            INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Bones' POV rises straight up as if still in a working\n            elevator.  It rises and we follow up from the basement to the\n            empty first floor, past the second floor to:\n\n            THE THIRD FLOOR\n\n            Where we're still inside, floating in the elevator cage. \n            Then the POV moves through the metal bars and floats towards\n            Bill, who's approaching the door of the room where Jimmy\n            died.\n\n            As Bill reaches to open it, Bones' POV floats closer - and\n            closer - right up on Bill's back now.  Bill feeling the hairs\n            on his neck suddenly rising.  Then he hears:\n\n                                HOLLOW ECHOES\n                      Go on.  It won't kill you.\n\n            Bill turns around to check with Maurice.\n\n                                BILL\n                      You had to hear tha...\n\n            But Maurice is gone.  And he doesn't see the shadow there\n            behind him.  Bill leans in to the door, listening...\n\n                                HOLLOW ECHOES\n                      I ain't gonna be the only one with this\n                      nigger's blood on my hands...\n\n                                BILL\n                      What the f--?\n\n            A hand jolts him from behind.  He spins -- it's just Maurice.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      'S up?\n\n                                BILL\n                      Nothing.  Contact paranoia.  Must be\n                      buggin' from hanging with you.\n\n            They turn to walk back down.  Maurice stops to re-light his\n            joint when the Bones-shadow reaches out to grab his wrist.\n\n            But it's no good.  The shadow hand passes right through,\n            Maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something.\n\n            Maurice lights his roach, and the match burns closer and\n            closer to his fingertips.  Then singes them and he drops the\n            match.  Maurice then heads downstairs after Bill.\n\n            The shadow remains behind, staring at the still burning match\n            on the wooden floor.  He bends down, staring intently as if\n            willing it to burn, his hands urging it on, the flame\n            suddenly rising.  But then the match sputters harmlessly out. \n            The shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs.\n\n            WHILE ON THE SECOND FLOOR\n\n            Tia explores the rest of the floor.  Hears a sound, like a\n            whimpering, from behind another door.\n\n            She slowly eases open the door then jumps back -- Inside, the\n            dog.  It growls low and mean, the black fur on the back of\n            it's neck rising.  It's eyes burning too red and bright.\n\n            Tia freezes.\n\n            The dog growls deeply at her.  And as he does we see the\n            Bones shadow rising behind her.  It seems to lean in and over\n            her, and the dog stops growling.\n\n            Tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger\n            for the dog to smell.\n\n            Bones' shadow from lingers behind her, perhaps simply\n            enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl.\n\n                                TIA\n                      How'd you get locked in here?  And for\n                      how long?  Poor baby...\n\n            The dog leaps up - but not to rip her throat out.  Instead it\n            snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp.\n\n                                TIA (CONT'D)\n                      Poor boy.  You must be starving.\n\n            INT.

Doing something.  Making it\n                      better.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Can't be done.

BONES' BUILDING - MORNING\n\n            Patrick's on a ladder replacing glass in the upper windows. \n            From down the block, we see Cinnabar heading out of her\n            mother's house, holding her portfolio.  The corners of papers\n            sticking out, splashes of color visible.\n\n            Patrick sees Cinnabar about to walk beneath his ladder.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Careful.

Or so my Momma\n                      says.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      What else does she say?\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And\n                      she is a lot of things, not all of them\n                      nice, but crazy Momma's not.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Way I figure, everything our parents tell\n                      us is part true and part total B.S.  And\n                      our whole job is figuring out for\n                      ourselves which is which.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      My momma says every house is two houses. \n                      Every street, two streets.  There's a\n                      whole city, a whole world, kinda beside,\n                      on top, just below this one.

Fingers rotting off?\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Maybe.  But there's an invisible wall, a\n                      fabric that kinda keeps things separate.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Lucky thing.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Yeah.  But when something bad happens,\n                      something really bad -- the wall breaks. \n                      The fabric tears.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      The dead get out?\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Or the living fall in.

Bill has to pull\n            Maurice's dog like attention away from the way Cinnabar's\n            bottom moves as she walks down the street to focus at the\n            matter at hand: unloading their shitload of equipment.\n\nThis portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not \nappear or occur elsewhere in the final movie.

Bill pulls out a six pack of beer. \n            He offers one to Shotgun who, after a beat, accepts it.\n\n            Maurice surreptitiously turns on his small hi-7 camera. \n            Holding it under his arm, but it's on.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      You ever hear of Jimmy Bones, sir?\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      What business is it of yours?\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Just wondered.

He was something.  He could be\n                      cold as ice or warm as blood.  But he\n                      never turned his back for a brother.\n\n            His eyes drift up to the building.\n\n                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n                      Always there.\n\n            Maurice goes in.

Get the hell out of\n                      there.  It's a bad place.  Always has\n                      been.\n\n            EXT. BLACKSTONE AVE. - DAY\n\n            Bill and Maurice walk around interviewing folks about Bones. \n            Bill with the DAT recorder, Maurice with the vidcam.\n\n            We see this through Maurice's shaky video camera:\n\n            grainy VIDEO SHOTS:\n\n            An OLD WOMAN.\n\n                                OLD WOMAN\n                      ...and every Tuesday, he'd roll by in his\n                      car and drive me with all my laundry to\n                      the laundromat so I wouldn't have to\n                      carry the clothes.\n\n            -- a dude in a wheel chair.  Drinking outta paperbagged\n            bottle with a wino hanging on the corner.\n\n                                WHEELCHAIR MAN\n                      Jimmy Bones?  Yeah, I knew that\n                      motherfucker.  People make out like he\n                      was some kinda damn Robin Hood. \n                      Bullshit.  I saw him cut some muhfucker's\n                      tongue once with that razor of\n                      his...dropped it right into that jar of\n                      dill pickles they used to have on the\n                      counter in the bar.\n\n                                WINO\n                      When I was a kid he used to slip twenties\n                      into my pocket so I could buy toys and\n                      shit.\n                          (now to Maurice/at camera)\n                      Bones was awrright.  He was solid.  And\n                      then one day, he just wasn't around no\n                      more.  Don't pay to ask too many\n                      questions 'round here.\n\n            INT. THE BUILDING - THAT NIGHT\n\n            Upstairs, inside what was once Bones' bedroom.  Beneath the\n            cracked ceiling mirror, Bill lies on the airmattress.  He's\n            listening with headphones to a minidisk player.\n\n            Eyes closed, head nodding to the beat.  Around him, we see\n            something strange.  The room shifts.\n\n            It's the same room.  But changed.  It looks like it did when\n            the frat boys were trapped in here.  Or in the instant after\n            Jimmy's death: all surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting\n            pattern in which we can dimly make out faces, as if people\n            were trapped on the surface of things.\n\n            Then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces\n            and into the room.  \n\n            So as Bill, eyes still closed, rocks to the hypnotic beats in\n            his headphones, we see the room around him begin to fill with\n            figures.\n\n            -- all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces\n            of floor and walls.  We hear a low murmur of ghost voices,\n            different languages.\n\n            And as the track ends, the sound cuts through Bill's\n            headphones and his eyes snap open.\n\n            But the room is empty.  And completely normal.  Bill pulls\n            off his head phones.  Ears strain to listen.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Tia?  Patrick?  That you?\n\n            The sounds return, fainter, and form above.  Bill looks up,\n            and for a fraction of a second in the mirror, Bill sees the\n            crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room.\n\n            Bill jolts out of bed and to the door, whips it open, and\n            someone dark looms right there.  But it's just Patrick.\n\n                                BILL (CONT'D)\n                      Shit.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Spooked?\n\n            Bill looks back into the room, normal now.  Glances up at the\n            mirror, just a cracked reflection of the empty room.\n\n                                BILL\n                      No.  Well, yeah.  Maybe just a little.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Yeah, there is a strange vibe here.\n\n            He stops.  Both brothers look at each other, waiting for the\n            other to admit he's seen or felt something's here.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Where's the others?\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\tINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The bathroom is entirely wood lined, like some '70's hot tub\n            paradise.  The room dominated by a large two person tub.\n\n            Tia lights four small scented candles on the counter.  The\n            wind through the open window blows the curtains.  She shuts\n            the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub.\n\n            She lies down in the bath, with her back to the door.  The\n            four candles throwing varying shadows of her.\n\n            Then one of the shadows becomes...the shadow of Bones.  All\n            it's attention is focused on one lit candle.  The one closest\n            to the curtain.\n\n            Slowly the Bones' shadow's fingers start to caress the\n            curtain to make it move, ever so slowly, closer and closer to\n            the candle.  The drapery reaches out, straining, straining\n            towards the candle flame.\n\n            Tia soaks with her eyes closed, enjoying the moist heat.\n\n            Bones' shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the\n            flame towards the curtain, the curtain towards the flame. \n            And soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little\n            flickering flame.  And in an instant the drape is on fire.\n\n            INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Patrick and Bill still talking in front of the bedroom, down\n            the hall from the bathroom.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      ...we just been in the damn suburbs too\n                      long.\n\n            Their conversation interrupted by screams from down the\n            hall... from the bathroom!\n\n            INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The drapes are fully ablaze now, flames lick at the wooden\n            walls.  Tia leaps out of the tub, screaming, trying to throw\n            bathwater at the burning drapes.\n\n            Patrick and Bill crash through the door.  Patrick rips the\n            drapes from the wall and throws them into the bathtub.\n\n            INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\n            Tia shivers in her bathrobe.  Bill and Patrick with her.\n\n                                TIA\n                      There wasn't any draft.  That window was\n                      closed.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      We're all tired.  Everybody makes\n                      mistakes.

BUILDING - DAY\n\n            Ladders, drop-cloths and the beginnings of new paint on the\n            old torn walls.  They're all eating take out burgers.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      I thought you were bringing the Colonel?\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried\n                      chicken.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Why not?

PEARL'S STOREFRONT - NIGHT\n\n            Pearl reaches into an old bureau drawer and pulls out an old\n            photo: Jimmy Bones with his arm around her.  She sits down at\n            her table with a drink and just looks at the picture of\n            herself and her lover when the world was innocent and young. \n            She downs her glass and wipes her tears away.\n\n            OUTSIDE - DOWN THE BLOCK\n\n            In the upper window of the Bones Building we see his\n            silhouette, staring down the block towards Pearl.\n\n            INT.

Always hungry.\n\n            His big black paw actually opens the refrigerator.  With his\n            long nose he digs into the meat drawer.  Inside he finds\n            plastic wrapped raw hamburger meat.\n\n            He pulls it out and drops it on the floor.  Tears it open and\n            gorges himself on the raw meat.\n\n            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The house looms malevolently in the moonlight.\n\n            INT.

OUT ON THE STREET - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Shotgun up in his window, still, holding his gun.  Hears the\n            howling.  He looks around, expecting to see his nemesis, the\n            black dog.  But only darkness.\n\n            EXT. JEREMIAH'S GATED COMMUNITY - NIGHT\n\n            Jeremiah's mansion stands in the moonlight.  Its faux\n            Gerogian splendor in stark contrast to Bones' building in the\n            old neighborhood.\n\n            INT.

MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters\n            and pads softly over to Jeremiah's side of the bed.\n\n            Where it stares intently at the sleeping Jeremiah, who begins\n            to toss and turn.  He settles again on his back.  His head\n            tilted back, his soft, vulnerable throat exposed.\n\n            The dog steps closer to the bed.  We can almost feel the\n            dog's hot fetid breath inches away from his throat.\n\n            The dog stares at Jeremiah.  And for just a second the long\n            doggy face wavers and changes: in shifting shades of black, a\n            ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur -- and\n            looks for an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out\n            Jeremiah's throat!\n\n            But at the last second it freezes.  Head cocks and ear lifts\n            as if hearing something in the wind.  Its master's voice,\n            perhaps.  And then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of\n            the room as silently as it entered.\n\t\t\t\nThis portion of the screenplay is originally pages 60-62.

She's about to knock\n            when she instinctively freezes.  We can almost see the hairs\n            standing up on her neck one by one.\n\n            She looks around -- what is it?  A sound, like a moan.  Is it\n            her name?  Or just the wind.\n\n            Suddenly, with a creak, the door swings open.\n\n            She takes a hesitant step into the building.  Suddenly she\n            jumps, as a door to her left flies open.\n\n            It's just Patrick.

First you can\n                      help us eat lunch.\n\n            Cinnabar follows Patrick into the room, with a last tense\n            look over her shoulder -- still the feeling something's\n            there.\n\n            INT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Tia's feeding the insatiable dog.  Handing quarter-pounders\n            to it, the thing scarfing 'em as fast as she can unwrap them. \n            Then, for a second, it stops.  And looks up.  And just stares\n            at something it knows is there -- but we humans can't see.\n\n                                TIA\n                      Watcha looking at, poochie?\n\n            Cinnabar follows the dog's glance.

Like\n                      they're looking right out of the world.\n\n            The dog continues scarfing down burgers, having him his way. \n            Cinnabar looks warily at the beast.  Who stares right back at\n            her while wolfing down the burgers.\n\n            BONES-VISION/POV\n\n            Steps through the rusted metal into the old elevator shaft\n            and we follow it as it floats down.\n\n            INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            As the dog above eats we again see Bones' shadow form looming\n            over the seeing dirt, the dirt moving ever so subtly, and for\n            a subliminal second the dirt seems to be glowing.\n\n            INT.

The carpet looks\n            perfect.  Old, a little faded, but clean.  No stains. \n\n            With a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the\n            room and closes the door behind him.  We remain in the room.\n\n            ANGLE ON\n\n            The now clean carpet.  Suddenly we see glutinous red liquid\n            seeping back up through the shag, until the stain is right\n            where it was.  Wet and fresh.  Then we see it spread and\n            move, in the shape of a body and the path by which it was\n            dragged out of the room.\n\n            The door opens again, and Patrick steps in to show off the\n            freshly painted room clean rug to Cinnabar and the others. \n            He's brought up short by the sight of the stain.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Must be something seeping through.  From\n                      the floor.\n\n            They roll the carpet back, thinking there must be something\n            on the floor.  The floor beneath the carpet is wet too, but\n            can't tell if it's from the rug or vice-versa.\n\n            He puts his hand down on the wood.  A low rhythmic rumbling.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Do you feel that?\n\n            The others place their hands on the floor.\n\n                                TIA\n                      Yeah.

BASEMENT - LATER\n\n            Patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very\n            strange sounds: groans, thumps, throbs.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Sounds like we got the Invisible Scratch\n                      Piklz hiding in our pipes.\n\n            Patrick traces the piping with the wrench, he comes to a\n            triple corner, where three small pipes all come together.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      I think these bring the water down from\n                      the bathroom.  Into this...\n\n            A larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath\n            the floor.  The thumping sounds emanate from here.  He puts\n            his finger along the seam of the joint.  He pulls it away,\n            red.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Check it out.  The same shit that was in\n                      the carpet.  Told you it was from the\n                      plumbing.\n\n            He lifts the wrench to tighten the seal.  The metal groans. \n            Then snaps.  Sending a thick spray of foul smelling red\n            sludge shooting out of the seam, right into Patrick's face.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Damn, I knew these pipes were wacked.\n\n            He turns the wrench the other way, re-tightening.  The sound\n            seems to move now through the piping.  Then the red sludge\n            sprays out of the next three joints, smearing the others.\n\n            The pounding, throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the\n            room, as if something were actually moving through the pipes\n            until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down,\n            disappearing beneath their feet.\n\n            Then a rasping bark calls their attention.  Bones the dog\n            sits by the padlocked door, panting.  Grinning.\n\n            Patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens\n            the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a\n            deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared.\n\n            INT. STORM CELLAR STAIRS - CONTINUOUS\n\n            As they go, the temperature drops.  A cold, damp sheen\n            appears on their skin.  Then comes a thick glutinous buzzing\n            sound.\n\n                                TIA\n                      What is that?\n\n            Flies.  The stairway walls are thick with furry black flies.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                          (stopping)\n                      Ugh.  Muchos moscos, man.

I think this qualifies as\n                      way more than \"some.\"\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      What a smell. \n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Hey, what you expect?  Where there's\n                      smoke there's fire.  And where there's\n                      flies, there's shit.\n\n            The stairs end in a dark, damp dirt cellar and the remnants\n            of the terminus of the old elevator shaft.\n\n                                MAURICE (CONT'D)\n                      Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space\n                      that was so perfect for a recording\n                      studio.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Yeah, well, Maurice is right.  It's gonna\n                      take more work than I thought.  But we\n                      can still do it.  We'll lay a real floor\n                      in here.  Put damping on the walls. \n                      Totally controlled sound.  Be perfect. \n                      No one could hear shit up on the street.\n\n            Behind them the dog is digging in the dirt.  Furiously.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Yeah, perfect.  Really excellent.  We can\n                      make our first record where no one can\n                      hear us scream.  Be afraid.\n\n            They're not paying any attention to the dog's incessant\n            digging.  Only Cinnabar is.  She's staring at it.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Oh god...\n\n            And she sees, in the deepening muddy hole at the dog's paws,\n            at first glimpses and then the full view, a rotted human\n            corpse.  Really just a skeleton.  With something sticking out\n            of its chest.  Cinnabar shrieks, while the guys try very hard\n            to act real cool.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Hello.  Who're you?\n\n            Maurice bends and pulls out the now blood rusted razor.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.

Don't know where\n                      the deuce is parked.\n\n            He points to one of the bony hands.  The left one.  On the\n            third finger is Jimmy's big diamond ring.\n\n                                BILL\n                      You think that's really him?\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Damn.  It's so...fresh.\n\n            And he's right.  Oddly for an old skeleton, there are strands\n            and bands of wet, raw flesh.  Maurice lifts the hand wearing\n            the ring.  He starts top pull it loose from the finger.\n\n                                TIA\n                      Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take\n                      that.

Bright color beneath the body. \n            Bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the\n            bones.\n\n            The dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of\n            color poking up.

She pulls back.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Shit!  Damn dog.

He's\n            loitering by the body, eyeing the ring.  She's staring into\n            the dark corner of the sub-basement.\n\n            HER POV IN THE DIM LIGHT\n\n            She sees something wavering, a shadow-mirage, Bones.\n\n                                PATRICK (O.S.)\n                      Cinn?\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      What?  Oh yeah.  Coming.\n\n            She follows the others upstairs.  Bones watches her form as\n            she climbs the steps, and --\n\n            -- for a second from BONES POV we see her mother, when she\n            was young.\n\n            Bones looks now at Maurice.  Who checks to see if the others\n            are gone.  Then Maurice hurriedly bends down, and while\n            holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull\n            Bones' ring off his finger.  But it's stuck.\n\n            He tugs again, harder, and rips the corpse's finger off.\n\n                                MAURICE\n                      Oh fuck.\n\n            Oh fuck is right.  Bones' shadow rears as it sees this\n            desecration.  Maurice slips the ring off the finger stump.\n\n                                MAURICE (CONT'D)\n                          (to the corpse)\n                      Sorry, but you wont' be needing this.\n\n            He places the finger back by the hand.  And pockets the ring.\n\n                                MAURICE (CONT'D)\n                      Or this.\n\t\t\t\t\t  \n            INT. BUILDING KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n            Tia fills a bowl with dry dog food.  But Bones the dog turns\n            his head away and just whimpers.\n\n                                TIA\n                      Picky mutt.\n\n            She pulls out a package of raw hamburger, dumps it into the\n            bowl, then leaves.  Behind her, the dog tucks into his chow.\n\n            INT. THE STORM CELLAR GRAVE - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The lock broken, the door stands ajar.  And as the dog gorges\n            upstairs, something very strange is happening down here.\n\n            Flesh is growing on the bones.  Bit by bit, red, wet strips\n            of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse.\n\n            The shadow looks down at his semi-reconstituted corpse.  It\n            almost looks like him, minus the skin.  But it still has a\n            long ways to go.  Still, mere strips of muscle and flesh on\n            the skeleton.\n\t\t\t\nThis portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not \nappear or occur elsewhere in the final movie.

PEARL'S STOREFRONT - NIGHT\n\n            Her usual small crowd arrives for her seance, all hoping this\n            will be the night they reach their loved ones' spirits.  From\n            outside, through the window, we see Pearl greet and seat each\n            of them around the table.  She starts lighting candles.\n\n            INT. BONES' PAD - NIGHT\n\n            Patrick and Cinnabar sipping a little Remy in his room. \n            Alone at last.  Awkward.  Intimate.  He refills her glass.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      She doesn't want me here.  With you.  In\n                      this house.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Believe me, my old man'd rupture his\n                      spleen if he knew we was down here.  All\n                      he talks about is the medal he deserves\n                      for building us a life as far from this\n                      'hood as possible.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      He probably thinks he's saving you from\n                      something.  I'm sure that's what my\n                      mother thinks.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      I'm sure I can make your mother like me. \n                      But then do I gotta worry 'bout your\n                      father?\n\n            Suddenly their banter is dead.  Her face looks stung, like\n            he'd slapped her.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      I don't know anything about my father.  I\n                      never met him.  Momma won't talk about\n                      him, either.\n\n            He puts his arms around her, and she melts into him.\n\n            INT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - NIGHT\n\n            Pearl and the others seated in the dim room around a circular\n            table.  They are holding hands.  Only candle light.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      We should begin with a hymn.\n\n            INT. BONES' BUILDING - NIGHT - UPSTAIRS\n\n            In Bones' old room, the temperature between Cinn and Patrick\n            goes from PG to R.\n\n            The two kiss passionately, deeply -- Cinnabar loses herself\n            for a long beat -- then as if swimming up from the bottom of\n            a deep pool, she pulls herself back.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      I can't.

I mean I'm not ready.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the\n                      boys.\n\n            EXT. PEARL'S STOREFRONT - NIGHT\n\n            From outside, through the open window, we can hear the\n            strains of singing coming from her window.\n\n            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            We float around the members of Pearl's circle.  See objects\n            on the table flickering in the candlelight.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      The spirit world is all around us right\n                      this minute.  And the departed are\n                      pressing in around us.\n\n            Still singing, they all glance about them in darkness as if\n            they can make out the spirits around them.\n\n            Over the low bass of their hymn-singing, her voice cuts in. \n            Uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air: it's a beautiful\n            voice and it does seem to open a window in the air.\n\n            INT. BONES' ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light.  Pitch dark\n            in there, can't see a thing.\n\n            As she's drifting off to dreamland, she hears what sounds\n            like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the\n            darkness of the room, we just stay on her face. \n\n            It's cold in the place.  And spooky.  So she doesn't mind\n            when she feels what she assumes is Patrick slip in bed beside\n            her.  Though we see only a shape sliding under the covers.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                          (half-asleep)\n                      It's okay, just don't get funny on me. \n                      It's warmer this way.\n\n            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Suddenly, the curtains fly open.  And Pearl's voice suddenly\n            stops... and the flame on the candle shoots up, scorching the\n            ceiling before returning to normal.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      Someone's with us.

She goes around the room,\n            inquiring for each of them.  Each time the table says \"No.\" \n            Until there is only her left.  An eerie pause.\n\n                                PEARL (CONT'D)\n                      Is the message for me?\n\n            The table starts bucking wildly.  And suddenly Pearl's neck\n            SNAPS back like it's been caught in a whip.\n\n            Her mouth opens and a low moan escapes.  But sounds nothing\n            like her voice.  A deep wind through an organ tube with\n            swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in.\n\n            Everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm.\n\n            As her eyes widen.  Go super close on her eyes and we see a\n            reflection in her pupil, not of the room she is in, but the\n            Jimmy's building twenty years ago.\n\n            INT. BONES' BUILDING - PAST/PRESENT\n\n            INTERCUT with her face back in the seance staring wide\n            mouthed in her trance.\n\n            The sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track.\n\n            Total dislocation for her as she sees Jimmy's old room, as it\n            was -- but also sees it as it is now, and with her daughter,\n            Cinnabar, lying underneath the covers of the big, round bed.\n\n            And lying close beside her, another figure beneath the\n            covers.\n\n            Whoever is there snuggles closer to Cinnabar.  She responds\n            as he presses against her, then wakes up.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                          (laughing low)\n                      Cut it out.\n\n            But he doesn't.  The movement beside her is undulant. \n            Strong, erotic, she almost gives into it.  And still laughs\n            as she says:\n\n                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)\n                      No, no Patrick.  Stop.\n\n            The figure in the bed presses urgently against her, in a\n            rocking movement which catches her up in it.  She can't help\n            it, she begins to respond to the urging behind her.\n\n            Pearl's eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one\n            fetid Necropoliptic texture.  The bed retains its shape but\n            liquefies, seems to become one with the floor and the walls,\n            all made of a kind of thick, bloody-mud in which the trapped\n            faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan.\n\n            Meanwhile, on that strange bed, the figure behind Cinnabar\n            seems to wrap soft limbs around her, locking her in embrace.\n\n                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)\n                      Cut it out.\n\n            But it doesn't cut out.  It builds.  Strong.  Erotic. \n            Insistent.  She almost gives in to it.\n\n                                CINNABAR (CONT'D)\n                      No, no Patrick.  Stop.\n\n            But the movement is more insistent.  And rougher.  She starts\n            to protest louder when she feels a hand, or something, steal\n            across her mouth to muffle her objections.\n\n            Pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter\n            and help her, but she can't.\n\n            INT. PEARL'S PARLOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Back at the seance, Pearl's back is arched like a bass fiddle\n            string bowed, and then drops.  Released.  Back in her chair.\n\n            The instant she's returned to herself she's out of her chair\n            and out the door.\n\n            INT. BONES' PAD - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Cinnabar struggles with something in the bed, the covers\n            pulled tight against her face, she can't scream.  She twists\n            and wrenches herself about, finally striking behind her with\n            a flailing fist, twists her face free and screams:\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Patrick!

No one attacking her.  And she sees Patrick in the\n            doorway.  But then who - or what - was in the bed?\n\n            Suddenly, her mother yells from below.\n\n                                PEARL (O.S.)\n                      Cinnabar!!!\n\n            Cinnabar lurches out of the bed over to the window.  Down\n            below, her mother's going nuts at the entrance, pounding on\n            the door and practically running over Bill who's opening the\n            door.\n\n                                PEARL (CONT'D)\n                      Outta my way, boy.

Freshly painted, with the neon sign.  But\n            Jeremiah's face shows nothing like what Patrick expected. \n            Nothing but a horrified, angry disgust.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Is this some kind of sick joke?\n\n            Jeremiah's so angry he almost smacks Patrick.\n\n                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)\n                      Listen to me, boy.

Some of the\n            others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what\n            the fuss is.  Then Jeremiah comes eye to eye with Pearl,\n            standing across the street, watching, worried out of her\n            mind.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tThen he looks up and sees Shotgun in the window.  Feeling\n            trapped, humiliated.  He wants out of this street.

BONES' PAD - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Shotgun mixes drinks at the bar and hands them to the just\n            arrived guests, Jeremiah, Officer Lupovich - looking stiff in\n            plain clothes - and Eddie Mack in his purple suit.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Hey Jimmy, you know Eddie Mack, don't\n                      you?\n\n                                BONES\n                      We met.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Yeah, we used to do the after-school b\n                      ball at Kenwood.  What it is?\n\n                                BONES\n                      What it will be.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      And Officer Lupovich.\n\n            Bones says nothing.  Just nods at the cop.\n\n                                MACK\n                      You got a nice crib here.\n\n                                BONES\n                      I do alright.  Everybody's happy.\n\n                                MACK\n                      But things change.  You gotta think\n                      ahead.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      They got lotteries all over now, Bonesy. \n                      Coming here too, maybe next year.\n\n            Bones' look sez: Bitch, don't call me that again.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Half our old customers are gonna be\n                      getting their people to cross state lines\n                      to pick up lotto tickets.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Besides, there's more money to be made in\n                      the gin than the juice.  What do anybody\n                      want with numbers anyway?\n\n                                BONES\n                      What else?

And it's way\n                      more profitable.  Nobody ever wins.  So\n                      you never have to pay out.\n\n                                BONES\n                      But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a\n                      twenty-dollar bag.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm\n                      talking about a five-dollar kick in the\n                      head that's a quick ticket to heaven. \n                      And the fools keep coming back for more.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Those 'fools' are my people.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po'\n                      man's free base.  Here, check it out.\n\n            Eddie pulls a little rock of crack out.  Jimmy takes it in\n            his hand and sniffs it.  Then shrugs and hands it back.\n\n                                BONES\n                      I ain't interested.  And if you gonna\n                      sell it, don't sell it round here.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Just try it.\n\n                                BONES\n                      I said, no thanks.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Go on.  It won't kill you.\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      Back off, Huggybear...\n\n                                MACK\n                      It's like this, Jimmy.  There's a wave\n                      coming.  A big ass Krakatoa, East of Java\n                      wave.  And either you gonna be on top of\n                      the wave up there in chocolate heaven, or\n                      you gonna be buried 'neath the muddy\n                      undertow.\n\n                                BONES\n                      That's cool.  Totally wide-screen sci-fi. \n                      Forward thinking.  I respect that.  But\n                      that ain't my life.  I'm here and now. \n                      Comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night\n                      in a warm nappy dugout.  I'm maintaining. \n                      That's what it's about for me.  And your\n                      twelve and a half-minutes is up.\n\n            Jimmy just walks away from him.  Meeting over.  Eddie and\n            Lupovich and Jeremiah all look at each other, frustrated.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Fine.  Let's go, Loopy-Lou.  Jimmy ain't\n                      into it.  Gonna skip the money train and\n                      take the bus.  His loss.\n\n            Lupovich turns but then spins back around with a .45 in his\n            hand and it's pointed at Jimmy's forehead.  Jeremiah didn't\n            expect this - or did he?\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I\n                      think you oughtta hear the deal.\n\n                                BONES\n                      I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't\n                      need any partners.  I don't need new\n                      product.  And I sure as hell don't need\n                      this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Just try it, Jimmy.  That's all...\n\n            He hands him the rock.  And a little pipe.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      You heard the man.  Try it.\n\n            Bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes\n            a deep puff.  Then lets out a deep cloud of smoke.\n\n            His eyes go a bit glazed.  And from his POV we see the room\n            start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly.\n\n            Just then, the door opens and Pearl steps in, distracting\n            Lupovich for an instant.\n\n            In one eternal crack fueled fast-and-slo-mo second: Jimmy\n            sees his chance, he pulls his razor, but too slow --\n\n            Lupovich turns, the razor no more than lightly slices his\n            arm, and he pulls the trigger on Jimmy Bones...\n\n            Pumping three shots into Jimmy's abdomen, knocking him to the\n            ground.  Shotgun grabs his gun, but too late.  He's covered.\n\n                                MACK\n                      Ain't worth it, Blood.  Just drop it. \n                      And kick it here.\n\n            Pearl in screaming shock.  Her lover bleeding on the carpet.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Tell her to stop screaming.\n\n            Bones is bleeding, and still tripping bad.\n\n                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)\n                      I said stop that bitch screaming or I'll\n                      spread her like butter.\n\n            Shotgun gently puts his hand on Pearl's mouth to quiet her.  \n\n            BACK IN BONES' FUCKED-UP POV:\n\n            Looking down he sees his own blood pouring out, a thick\n            divine river of many colors.  Looking up, they all stand\n            wavering above him, hungry demons, their voices distorting.\n\n                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)\n                      Get his razor.  I ain't gonna be the only\n                      one with this nigger's blood on my hands.\n\n            Mack plucks Bone's silver razor right out of his hands.\n\n                                LUPOVICH (CONT'D)\n                      Take the gloves off.  Everybody leaves a\n                      print.  We hang out together.  Or we hang\n                      separately.  Cut him.  And cut him good.\n\n            Eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the\n            razor into Jimmy.\n\n                                MACK\n                      What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Now you.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      No way man...\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your\n                      choice.\n\n            Jeremiah gets down near Bones.  Bones stares right into his\n            eyes, as his life blood pours freely, weakly lifts his arm to\n            his best friend's face.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Jay bird...help me...like brothers.\n\n            Jeremiah feels Lupovich's gun behind his head.  Hears it\n            cocked.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Sorry, my brother.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Since we was just grasshoppers...\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      You always told me, it's a dog eat dog\n                      world.\n\n            And he thrusts Bones' razor right between the ribs.  Bones'\n            eyes tighten, but never lose their lock on Jeremiah's eyes. \n            His mouth moves as if he's trying to speak.  Instead, he\n            spits a bog of blood right into Jeremiah's face.\n\n            A shaken Jeremiah hands the bloody razor to Shotgun.\n\n                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)\n                      Just do it.  He won't even feel it.\n\n            Bones' eyes bore into Shotgun's.  Shotgun hesitates.  Eyeing\n            his gun on the floor, feeling the one on the back of his neck\n            -- calculating his chances.\n\n            Then Shotgun slices him.  Bones flinches, he definitely still\n            feels it.  Shotgun hands the razor back to Eddie.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Now you, girlie.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      I won't.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Same deal all around.  Or die with him.\n\n            She takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover. \n            Her hands trembling.  There's no way she can do it.  Lupovich\n            brings the gun to the back of her head.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      I can't.  I won't.  Go ahead.  Shoot me. \n                      I'll be better off.\n\n            Bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck, weakly\n            storking her there... And with his other hand, Bones takes\n            her wrists and pulls her hand towards him, burying his razor\n            in his heart.  His eyes roll back and his hand falls away and\n            he's gone.\n\n            She drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out\n            of his chest, a river of blood pouring from around it.\n\n            BONES POV\n\n            As his spirit rises and rises, up to the ceiling, looking\n            down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death.\n\n            Pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood. \n            Then in a frantic daze tears her dress off.  Jeremiah gently\n            takes her bloody dress.\n\n            From above, Bones can hear them speaking below, but it's as\n            if they were speaking far away.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Too risky to take him outside.  Take him\n                      down to the storm cellar and bury him. \n                      And get rid of this too.\n                          (tosses Pearl's bloody dress)\n                      Let this whole damn building be his tomb.\n\n            Shotgun and Lupovich drag Bones' body out of the room,\n            leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet.\n\n            BONES POV\n\n            As he stares down in horror at all this.  Above him, it seems\n            he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky, and a\n            swirling light opening above his head.\n\n            NOW HIS POV\n\n            Is floating upward towards the light, but then he looks\n\n                                                               BACK DOWN\n\n            Staring down at the sight of his body in a deep puddle of\n            blood, and his murderers removing his woman's dress covered\n            with is blood.  As he sees this, his (and ours) POV changes,\n            becomes darker, yet clearer; too sharp, razor sharp as some\n            softness, perhaps life itself, drains out of it.  Bones sees\n            his best friend Jeremiah and Lupovich together dragging his\n            body out the door, leaving a thick wet stain behind him.\n\n            We can hear Jimmy's last wail of rage twist and distorts in\n            the air, becoming another deeper voice within the voice...\n            And then he (and we) plunge back down to the ground, right to\n            the dark, wet stain in the carpet...\n\n            Hit it and go down through an instant's glimpse into the\n            black sea beneath the foundation of the world:\n\n            Necropolis.  Where space itself seems to be made of pale\n            bloated, gnawing, writhing things.  Bodies perpetually\n            devouring themselves and each other.\n\n            We see through this dog-eat-dog nightmare, back out through\n            the blood stain as through a key hole slowly closing.\n\t\t\t\nThis portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not \nappear or occur elsewhere in the final movie.  In order to maintain the \nintegrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.\n\n            EXT. CLUB - LATER\n\n            A line out front.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Be cool.  Everybody's gonna get in.\n\n            Patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing\n            anxious glances down the block towards Cinnabar's home.\n\n            Torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and\n            disappointment that Cinnabar's not there to share it.\n\n            People chomping to get in.  Across the street Shotgun watches\n            with dismay.\n\n            Patrick hears voices down the street.  Looks up to see\n            Cinnabar walking towards the club.  His smile freezes when he\n            sees Pearl right behind her.  Trying to stop Cinn.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      ...I've seen things.  In there.

You were crying like a baby.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      You said the vision, the images.  They're\n                      just that.  Just pictures.  They can't\n                      hurt you.  That's what you always said.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      I lied.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      All the more reason I should be here.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      Please.

Good things\n                      are happening here.  Maybe for the first\n                      time ever.  And maybe that's all it\n                      takes.\n\n            Pearl sees she can't stop Cinn.  Any more than her mother\n            could have stopped Pearl when she was her age.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      I hope so, child.  I really hope so.\n\n            She can only watch as Cinnabar gives Patrick a big hug and\n            follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club.\n\n            INT. THE BUILDING/CLUB - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The place is unfinished.  But all the cooler for it.  The bar\n            is crude.  Cheap beer and jug wine.  But the crowd don't\n            mind.  The place is alive.

Walking through the throbbing\n            crowd, making a path right through them, most of the dancers\n            paying it no mind, it's just another part of the trippy\n            scene.  Or do they even see it?  We can't tell.\n\n            CLOSER ANGLE - ON THE DOG\n\n            And it's single-minded concentration.  Staring straight ahead\n            as it moves through the crowd towards Maurice, who for a\n            second, notices the dog coming but making nothing of it.\n\n            REVERSE - THE DOG'S POV\n\n            What it's staring at.

He starts\n            crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch. \n            While trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws\n            of the canine creature...\n\n            INT. THE CLUB - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Maurice's screams are inaudible.  Just another faint part of\n            the complicated mix.

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare\n            tableaux.  Maurice lies in a pool of blood.  His body shakes\n            and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver.\n\n            Patrick starts for Maurice but the dog growls to keep him\n            back away from its precious food.  Patrick backs up a step. \n            Almost out of his mind with terror.  He really loses it when\n            the dog, in SLO-MO, looks up and directly at him.  It seems\n            to be wearing Maurice's face and speaks with a twisted\n            version of his (Maurice's) voice:\n\n                                DOG/MAURICE\n                      The gangsta of love don't eat no fried\n                      chicken...\n\n            And before Patrick can even freak, the dog has returned to\n            it's normal dog face, and it lunges at Patrick, taking a\n            sizeable bite out of his arm.\n\n            Patrick leaps back out the door, with only a fast glance back\n            at the thing in the room --\n\n            The dog is not following him.  It's standing.  Over Maurice's\n            remains.  Growling low, it begins to shudder uncontrollably\n            to bulge and ooze.\n\n            The gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and\n            finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots, flying\n            all over the room and all over Patrick's eyes and in his\n            mouth.\n\n            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The body is now done.  It looks whole again.  Even strong and\n            young.  If still gray and cold until Bones lies down, curls\n            up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the\n            vital life force of his vengeful rage.\n\n            Bones/The Body opens his eyes, stands up not tottering as\n            before but filled with strength.  He looks as good as new,\n            except for the tattered clothes.\n\n            ON THE DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The dancers can't hear Patrick screaming or running down the\n            stairs.  They're just groovin' along to Ill Bill and the\n            funk.\n\n            Until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the\n            ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes, into their\n            drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices.\n\n            Then Patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell\n            breaks loose as the sight of him, plus the maggots, sends\n            everyone tearing for the exits.\n\n            Seeing his brother in terror, Bill slams the tone arm\n            screeching the needle across the record, leaving only the\n            psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the\n            mix.\n\n            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Meanwhile, down below, the freshly embodied Bones studies the\n            gas furnace.  This time when he bends down to blow out the\n            light -- wooosh, he blows it out.  He reaches under the tank\n            and the gas hisses out.\n\n            Then he eyes his old razor on the floor.  With a confident,\n            strong grip, he picks it up and now, finally --\n\n            BONES IS BACK IN BUSINESS.\n\n            INT. DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Hell-maggots still falling onto people, maggots on the floor\n            making people slip and fall as they jam the exits.  Screaming\n            chaos, people trying to break windows to get out faster...\n\n            Patrick looks across the chaotic room and sees Cinnabar and\n            Tia cringing under a table.  Trapped there.  Bill in the\n            doorway trying to get people out.\n\n            INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            At the top of the stairs, leading up out of the sub basement,\n            Bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light.  Then flips the\n            light switch -- the spark ignites the gas behind him.  It\n            causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement.\n\n            The fire's light seems the very glow of hellfire behind Bones\n            as he marches up the stairs, razor in his hand.\n\n            INT. DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Patrick, trying to stay low, crawls his way to where his\n            sister and Cinnabar are trapped.\n\n            Fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through\n            the floor.  The room is filling with smoke.\n\n            Bill's helping those trampled in the rush to get out.  Bill\n            himself bleeds badly from his neck.\n\n            Patrick runs with Cinnabar and Tia toward the door.  And as\n            the smoke fills the room, through the haze we see:\n\n            Bones step into the room.  His arm raised with the razor. \n            And he flings it out, like a boomerang, the razor flies\n            around the room.\n\n            It swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids,\n            hacking at them through the smoke, like some savage bird,\n            though it doesn't seem intent on slaughtering them, but\n            rather herding them out.  Bill and Patrick pull Cinnabar and\n            Tia out the door -- they're the last in the room.\n\n            Suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid-air and zips back\n            into Bones' waiting fist - just like a boomerang.\n\n            Razor held high, Bones advances on them, steadily, cool as\n            ice amidst the now fully burning house.\n\n            EXT.

See him raise his fists in a rage.  Or\n            is it in triumph?  Before his figure is obscured by falling\n            debris.\n\n            Sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start\n            unrolling a hose.

Beautiful hands.  I\n                      didn't even know.  That night.  When they\n                      - we - killed him, that you were already\n                      alive inside me.  Life's like that. \n                      Grows right out of death.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      But if it's him.

Remnants\n            of the staircase lead up to fragments of the upper floors. \n            Smoke still billowing from the empty center of the ruin.\n\n            Silhouetted in the smoke and the low light of the rising sun:\n            a tall, dark figure, not of then, nor quite of now.\n\n            It is Bones.  Taller, thinner, darker and more menacing then\n            ever.  But unmistakably Bones.  He steps out of the rubble. \n            And looks across the street, up at Shotgun's lit window.\n\n            INT. SHOTGUN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Shotgun's hand shakes as he pours another shot.  Then downs\n            it.  He turns to the window and freezes at what he sees.\n\n            Bones face is just outside the window.  The second story\n            window.  Smiling in at him.  Shotgun is petrified.  But then\n            he picks up his gun and shoots at the face in the window.\n\n                                BONES (O.S.)\n                      Free at last, free at last.\n\n            Shotgun whirls and there stands Bones behind him now.\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      It wasn't my fault.  I didn't know what\n                      they'd planned.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Shush.  It don't matter now.\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      No.  Really, Jimmy.  Remember, man.  It's\n                      me.  I was on your side.  Don't you\n                      remember?\n\n            He just walks towards the terrified Shotgun, closer and\n            closer, leaning right over his shotgun, his face coming just\n            inches from Shotgun's face.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Take a look at what I remember,\n                      brother...\n\n            His big brown eyes fill Shotgun's vision, and in what now\n            seem to be the gigantic pupils in Bones' eyes, Shotgun sees\n            the old apartment, and there it all is again and again.\n\n            Shotgun sees himself hesitating, almost risking it all and\n            instead giving in, stabbing Bones -- he can't look away. \n            Then Bones closes his eyes.  Shotgun sobbing now.\n\n                                SHOTGUN\n                      I had no choice, Jimmy.  What else could\n                      I do?\n\n                                BONES\n                      You coulda died with me.  Died trying.\n\n            Shotgun is cradling his weapon, hands shaking.  He points it\n            at Bones and pulls the trigger.  Bones doesn't even flinch as\n            the pellets rip through him.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      Feel better?\n\n            Bones' impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor.  He\n            waves the razor in front of Shotgun, the rusty blade swinging\n            free back and forth, hypnotically, with a rasping sound.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      You gonna be free and clear, Shotgun. \n                      All debts paid...\n\n            And then in one swift motion, on the back stroke, Bones' hand\n            and razor slash across Shotgun's throat.\n\n            Shotgun doesn't even have time to scream, we just hear his\n            breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his\n            neck.\n\n            Bones bends down and cradling his old friend, whispers gently\n            into his ear.  Singing, perhaps.  We can't quite hear.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      See you on the other side, brother.\n\n            Bones gets up and moves around the room, standing before the\n            window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own.\n\n            For a second he sees the old neighborhood, everybody hanging\n            out.  Then he blinks back to reality.  He looks down the\n            block and sees Pearl's reader and advisor sign.\n\n            INT. JEREMIAH'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n            Bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom, staring\n            at the ceiling.\n\n            Tia's out in the living room, sitting on the couch weeping in\n            her mother's arms.\n\n            Patrick's in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his\n            back and arms.  He's frightened.  And angry.  He storms out\n            of the bathroom, down the hall to his father's office.\n\n            INT. JEREMIAH'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS\n\n            As Patrick slams the door behind him, Jeremiah hides a stack\n            of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Did you do it?\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Sure, son.

BLACKSTONE STREET - NIGHT\n\n            That night we see a walking shadow.  The long tall black clad\n            Bones.  Heading down his old block.  Alone.\n\n            As he moves, his face changes, at times demonic and intent. \n            But periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to\n            reveal a similar but different face below.  More human, lost,\n            pained, confused, and we see why:\n\n            FROM BONES' FUCKED UP UNDEAD POV:\n\n            The dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for\n            brief instants into the street of twenty years ago.\n\n            One moment, people nodding to him, waving, blowing kisses.\n            And then suddenly, it's the empty burnt block it is now.\n\n            Bones' face shifts, cracking, one second the hungry ghost. \n            The next, he's the old Bones who once ruled this 'hood.\n\n            He sees, down the block, the old palmistry sign.  It's\n            Pearl's place.  For a second, the face of the real Jimmy\n            Bones triumphs and he smiles.  Then hears voices behind him.\n\n            Stank and Weaze.  They see a tall, thin figure in some very\n            fine looking, long duster.\n\n                                STANK\n                      Looking to score?\n\n                                BONES\n                      Unh-unh, little brother.

Here it is.\n\n            Suddenly, out from the depths of his shadow, flies the edge\n            of Bones' razor and the blade slashes Stank in the face. \n            Cutting a sideways, smart aleck smile in his cheek.\n\n            Weaze pulls a gun and shoots Bones.  Bones jolts a little as\n            the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach.  But he takes it\n            like a punch and looks up.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      Cut that shit out.\n\n            He grabs one of the boys in each long hand and hoists them up\n            to his height and pins them against the wall.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be\n                      seeing him.

Her\n            hands shuffle large tarot cards.  She lays her own spread. \n            First card face down.  Second card face up.\n\n            THE LOVERS.\n\n            And across it the third is laid: the crumbling Tower.\n\n            Then she slips the first card, the down-turned card out and\n            flips it face up.  Death.

His face wavering between the true\n            face of Jimmy Bones and the angry Bones ready to kill her.\n\n            Then he wraps his arms around her and they kiss.  She faints,\n            the cards in her fist fluttering to the floor.\n\n            He lays her gently down.  When suddenly Cinnabar throws the\n            door open.\n\n            She and Bones make eye contact.  She sets eyes for the first\n            time on the father she's never known.

Then with\n            sudden coke-fueled ferocity, he whips around and starts\n            smacking the shit out of Stank, breaking his nose.  The coke\n            whore cheering Eddie on.

Which they\n            are both doing to excess.\n\n            Mack's wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs\n            (not a pretty sight).

He walks towards her, slowly...\n\n            Then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the\n            floor right towards him.

And the coke actually flies\n            straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and\n            shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose.\n\n            He reels back, choking.  Coughing.  After having probably an\n            ounce fly straight up his snot-locker.  Blood pouring out his\n            nose.  Wobbly now.\n\n            He hears a low echoing laughter through the club, and the\n            sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls\n            spinning 'round the table.\n\n                                MACK (CONT'D)\n                      Who's there?\n\n            Bones stands by the pool table, under the overhanging light. \n            He pulls out his razor and with one savage slice, splinters\n            the pool cue in two.\n\n                                MACK (CONT'D)\n                      Bones?

What the\n                      hell you done to me?\n\n            Bones stops for a moment and looks down at his waist and we\n            see Mack's severed head tied to Bones' belt.  Severed, yet\n            seemingly alive.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Not half what I'm planning on...\n\n                                MACK'S SEVERED HEAD\n                      This some sick fucked up shit.

Fuck you.  Look, I killed you. \n                      You killed me.  Fine.  Now...\n\n            Bones got no time to argue.  He bends and picks up a handful\n            of fetid city garbage.\n\n                                MACK'S SEVERED HEAD (CONT'D)\n                      ...we're even.  No need to get all meta\n                      fucking-phys-i-gack...\n\n            And shoves it into the still talking mouth of Mack.\n\n            EXT. SOUTHWEST SIDE - NIGHT\n\n            Bright, loud summer night.  Blues coming from inside a blues\n            bar, the guy playing \"Killin' Floor\".\n\n            Lupovich heads toward the Armor building.  From a distance,\n            he sees a young runner emerge from a passage on the farside \n            of the building then set off to meet his mark.  Lupovich\n            heads for the passage, the music following him.\n\n            Lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching.  Then\n            slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse.\n\n            A scary walk through inky darkness, scattered with broken\n            glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light\n            spilling like blood out of the open door into the old\n            slaughterhouse at the end of the way.\n\n            Lupovich reaches the back, right next to the old loading dock\n            where the still-livestock were unloaded.  He enters the door,\n            disappearing into the red darkness.\n\n            INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The room, large and open, soaked in the sodium vapor that\n            streams through the tall windows from the streetlights.\n\n            There are a few blood rusted meat hooks still there, backlit,\n            hanging from the ceiling.  Graffiti covers the walls with\n            arcane tags and symbols.  The floors are caked with a sticky\n            grime turned black in the orange haze.\n\n            In the far corner burn three red votive candles.  Behind the\n            candles lies a crumpled brown paper bag.  The stash.\n\n            Lupovich starts over to the corner, twitching at the gross\n            sound of his shoes sticking to the layers of old coagulated\n            blood on the killing floor.\n\n            Behind him, framed for an instant int he doorway - a tall,\n            sharp shadow, a walking razor - Bones!\n\n            The walk is tense.  Somehow the music has followed him here\n            and is echoing and wailing in the walls around him.  He gets\n            to the corner, and reaching over the candles, opens the top\n            of the paper bag.  Jackpot.  Five ziplocks of the rocks.\n\n            He hears a noise.  Lupovich fumbles for his gun and at the\n            same time reaches to snatch the stash bag.  His wrist touches\n            the candles flame and it burns.\n\n                                LUPOVICH\n                      Shit!  Fuck!\n\n            He hears another noise, a blade scraping on concrete, right\n            behind him.  Now the music blends with the echoing squeals of\n            the hogs once butchered on the cutting line.\n\n            Lupovich hears another noise, a blade scraping on concrete,\n            right behind him.  Now the music blends with the echoing\n            squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line.\n\n            Lupovich turns and there, towering over him, stands Bones. \n            And just as startling, there's Mack's laughing severed head\n            swinging from his belt.\n\n            Lupovich can only choke on his terror, and while his mouth is\n            open, Bones shoves a glass pipe into it.\n\n            Brandishing his razor, Bones packs a rock into the bowl and\n            torches it.  He holds the razor to Lupovich's throat.\n\n                                BONES\n                          (in Mack's voice)\n                      \"Just try it...go ahead...it won't kill\n                      you.\"\n\n            Lupovich, trembling, takes a massive hit of the crack deep\n            into his lungs.  The music and the sounds of the dying pigs\n            attack him as the coke fills his lungs and then his blood and\n            then his brain, his eyes starting to bug.\n\n            Bones then knocks the pipe from his lips and seals his hand\n            over Lupovich's mouth and nose.  He can't exhale.  The sounds\n            get louder, the grafted walls come alive.\n\n            Bones removes his hand revealing Lupovich's nose is fused\n            shut, and his mouth is simply gone, the skin flat where the\n            mouth used to be.\n\n            Lupovich's gotta lung full of crack, and no way to exhale. \n            Severed Mack laughs insanely as he sees Lupovich's eyes bulge\n            as his lungs start to strain under the agony.\n\n            His frenzied suffocation is nothing but pure torture.  While\n            he is still kicking with the fear and the drug rush, Bones\n            drags Lupovich to the middle of the room.\n\n            With one arm, Bones lifts the fat cop up and hooks him to one\n            of the meat hooks above.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                          (in Lupovich's voice)\n                      \"I ain't gonna be the only one with this\n                      nigger's blood on my hands...\"\n\n            As Lupovich squirms, Bones takes his blade, and shoves it in\n            just below Lupovich's sternum.  And a spray of blood paints\n            Bones and Mack's hanging head.\n\n            Thick crack smoke emerges from the wound and floats, foglike,\n            out of the chest cavity.  Bones then yanks the blade\n            southward and slices the cop's belly wide open.\n\n            We hear Lupovich's guts spill out on the floor.\n\n                                MACK'S SEVERED HEAD\n                      Was that really necessary?  Can you wipe\n                      my fucking face?  I can't see a goddamned\n                      thing.\n\n            The dope smoke wafts in the room four feet off the floor. \n            The song immolates itself.  Blood drips.  And Bones adds\n            another weight to his belt.\n\n            EXT. ROSSMORE PARK - NIGHT\n\n            Just round the corner from the entrance to the gated suburb. \n            Cinnabar and Pearl.

The real terror of\n            thinking your car just hit a human being.\n\n            Then a face appears in the car window.  Just a homeless guy\n            shaking an angry fist at them.

Nearby\n            is the elevator shaft, a gaping hole in the ruins - but\n            recognizable as such.  The ceiling above them is nearly\n            collapsed, and over most of the room, the accumulated debris\n            and ruin from above has simply fallen through.\n\n            And what remains of the ceiling is still shifting, groaning,\n            coming apart.\n\n            Patrick shines his flashlight down to the ground, until:\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Here.\n\n            He's found the hole that was Bones' hastily dug grave, but\n            there's nothing in it now but swarming white maggots.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      Is it there?\n\n            She gets down on her hands and knees as Patrick shines the\n            light, but after a few frantic moments of digging, it's\n            clear:\n\n                                PEARL (CONT'D)\n                      It's gone.

All traces of the demonic are gone.  Pearl\n            melts as the Delfonics swell, Jimmy holding her close.\n\n                                BONES (CONT'D)\n                      I want you to do something for me, baby.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      What?\n\n            We see what he's holding: the dress.  Rotted and blood\n            clotted and ruined.\n\n                                BONES\n                      I always loved you in this dress.\n\n            He holds it up for Pearl to see and from:\n\n            HER POV\n\n            The dress is brand new and beautiful.  She's finally\n            entranced.\n\n            INT. THE SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            Patrick, Bill and Cinnabar have managed now to pry open the\n            elevators outer doors.  They step inside on the soft ashen\n            ground and look up:\n\n            THEIR POV\n\n            The shaft goes all the way into eternity.  But along the\n            tacked walls, they see hand and footholds put there for\n            workers.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      We can climb out.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Climb out to where?\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Anywhere but here.\n\n            One by one they start to climb, Bill first.  As they climb,\n            they become aware of light on the first floor level just\n            ahead.\n\n            BACK IN BONES' CRIB\n\n            Pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor\n            length mirror on Bones' closest door.\n\n            PEARL'S POV - IN THE MIRROR\n\n            Not only the dress, but she too looks exactly as she was 22\n            years ago, skin smooth as cocoa butter, eyes free from worry\n            and pain.  \n\n            Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly\" as Jimmy takes her in his\n            arms and starts to slow dance her in the midst of all those\n            candles.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      Where are we, baby?\n\n                                BONES\n                      Where we'll always be...\n\n                                PEARL\n                      But.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Hush, baby.\n\n            Pulls her closer, closer, until her last misgivings are gone. \n            Whatever purpose she came with lost in the power of having\n            the impossible.\n\n            INT. THE ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS\n\n            The three still climbing handhold by handhold, knocking loose\n            dirt in each others' eyes.  Bill is just now reaching the\n            first floor level, trying to force open the outer doors.\n\n            Suddenly, an ominous sound: the chain/mechanism of the\n            elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them. \n            Panicking, Bill tries with all his might.\n\n            As the elevator inches closer and closer --\n\n            Until Bill finally manages to get the doors open.  They all\n            scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them.\n\n            NEW ANGLE\n\n            After they catch their breath, they look up and around to\n            find themselves -- \n\n            INT. THE NECROPOLIS - CONTINUOUS\n\n            A distorted M.C. Escher-like feel to the place.  Where up\n            seems to be down, down up, and left is right.  Not helped by\n            behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps\n            outside, and the moonlight falling through the skylight.\n\n            Then, slowly through the gloom, they begin to perceive that\n            the walls are clotted and congealed, teratomic masses of\n            distorted flesh; faces, limbs, eyes, mouths, all trapped -\n            all contorted in agony.  At first they seem to be frozen in\n            the walls, like the ruins of Herculaneum.  But then we see --\n\n            They are slowly writhing, moving.  Hands grasping, teeth and\n            rotted jaws widening, and worst of all, the eyes staring out.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Is this Hell?\n\n                                BILL\n                          (gripping the gun)\n                      Or just Hell-adjacent...\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Ain't no Heaven.  Ain't no Hell.  There's\n                      just the world of the dead, my momma\n                      always talked about.  Like she said, the\n                      door is open, and we're seeing right\n                      through our world into this one.  We just\n                      have to remember what was really here. \n                      And follow it.  Those stairs should take\n                      us to the second floor.\n\n            As they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the\n            drone/moan of the dead, the soft music playing in Bones'\n            crib.\n\n            ANGLE AS\n\n            They start up the stairs into the darkness.  Patrick first,\n            Cinnabar in between him and Bill.  Patrick still holding his\n            flashlight, but it's starting to flicker a little.\n\n            More of the same horror along the stairway walls, eyes\n            looking at them, hands caress Cinnabar's hair, another hand\n            shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing Bill's thigh. \n            Bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt.  And the\n            hands shoot back down.\n\n            BACK IN BONES' CRIB\n\n            The Munch-like dance of death goes on, Bones stroking the\n            back of her neck.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Just like I told you this morning, I'd be\n                      stroking your neck tonight.\n\n            Pearl absolutely lost.\n\n            BACK ON THE STAIRS\n\n            The three still ascending when Patrick's flashlight suddenly\n            cuts out.  Total darkness.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Shit.\n\n            A faint sound: Patrick shaking the flashlight.  Nothing but\n            the sound of breathing, both human and non-human.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Thing worked fine a minute ago. \n                      Batteries were brand new -- \n\n            Then as suddenly as it went out, the flashlight comes back\n            on, illuminating a horrible sight: Maurice.  Standing right\n            there, a few feet in front of them.\n\n                                BILL\n                      Maurice!\n\n            Maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow. \n            The boys want it to be Maurice.  But Cinnabar knows better.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      That's not Maurice --\n\n            But with the beam of the flickering flashlight, they follow\n            the shadowy figure up the steps.\n\n            Then Maurice gets a bit to far ahead, and they can't see him\n            for a beat.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Maurice.  Hold up, man.\n\n            Then after a silent beat, just Maurice's hand appears back\n            out of the darkness, beckoning them onward.  Then the\n            flashlight cuts out again.  They're back in the darkness.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                          (as he shakes the flashlight)\n                      Okay, we're on the second floor.  I feel\n                      it.  No more steps.\n\n            The sound of Patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around\n            in the torch.  Eventually it comes on again.\n\n            Up ahead, they still barely see Maurice, his back to them,\n            face in one quarter profile, leading them towards the next\n            flight of stairs at the end of the hall.\n\n            They follow.  Closer and closer to the stairs, Maurice going\n            eerily in and out of their vision.  The flashlight dies\n            again.\n\n            Darkness.  Patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly.  Then\n            just as quickly dies again!  A shake and it's lit again --\n            just as Bill is stepping into the corner where Maurice\n            disappeared.\n\n            FLICKERING HORROR\n\n            As the dog leaps at them from the corner, all teeth and\n            slavering jaws!  Everyone scrambles for their lives, and the\n            flashlight falls to the floor.\n\n            LOW ANGLE FROM THE FLOOR - JUST BEHIND THE FLASHLIGHT\n\n            We see the skewed horror: as the dog tears at Bill, as his\n            gun skitters across the floor; as Patrick grabs the gun and\n            fires, and we get a bit more illumination from the exploding\n            gunpowder.  But it does no good.\n\n            Bill screams in terror as he's torn to pieces, and then the\n            flashlight goes out and again, we're in Stygian darkness. \n            The sound of Bill dying and a long silence.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Bill?!  Cinnabar?  Cinnabar?!\n\n            No answer.  At first.  Finally in husky voice:\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      I'm here.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Bill!  Bill?!\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Patrick, he's...\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Okay, okay.  Listen:\n\n            From somewhere comes the sound of the music from Bones' crib.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right\n                      near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk\n                      up there.\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      I can't find you.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Here!\n\n            Silence.  As we expect the worse, expect something else to\n            take her hand.  But then:\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      Is that you?\n\n            Pause -- the music from Bones' crib still beckons to them.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Yeah.  Come on.  Don't let go.\n\n            We're in near total darkness as they climb the stairs, maybe\n            a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third\n            floor they're approaching.  All we can hear is their\n            footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the\n            way up the stairs and emerge into:\n\n            BONES' CRIB - THEIR POV\n\n            Both amazed to see Pearl as young and beautiful as Cinnabar\n            is, clinging to the dashing Jimmy dancing to the spectral\n            sounds of some soul classic from back in the day.  Cinnabar\n            entranced by the vision.\n\n            ANGLE AS\n\n            Pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them, smiling and\n            beckoning Cinnabar to come join her.  Cinnabar begins to.\n\n            Patrick watches her until he hears something O.S. calling to\n            him.  It sounds a million miles away and yet right in his\n            ear.  And it sounds like Jeremiah.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Paaatrick...\n\t\t\t\t\t  \nThis portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not \nappear or occur elsewhere in the final movie.

He moves to the wall, drawn by\n            the strange sight and the recurring sound...\n\n                                JEREMIAH (CONT'D)\n                          (as if a million miles away)\n                      Patrick.  Help me.\n\n            It's coming from within the wall. \n\n            INTERCUTTING\n\n            Now, while Cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and\n            father across the room --\n\n            Patrick, at the wall, tries to place his ear near it in order\n            to hear where the voice is coming from.\n\n            While Cinnabar is now within Bones' reach.  Pearl steps back\n            to allow Jimmy to embrace Cinnabar.  They're reunited.\n\n                                BONES\n                      Welcome home, baby girl.\n\n            Pearl watches as Bones caresses his daughter's cheek. \n            Patrick now close to the wall -- trying to hear the faint\n            voice calling to him.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Please...help me...\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      Dad?\n\n            Suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall. \n            Patrick stumbles back as his father's head and torso press\n            out from the wall, stretched in straining effort.\n\n                                JEREMIAH\n                      Help me.

I don't want to spend forever\n                      like this.\n\n            Jeremiah's arm reaches out from the wall, grasping towards\n            Patrick, who reaches out to his father -- \n\n            When suddenly with frightening speed Jeremiah grabs it, and\n            wrenches Patrick to him, pulling Patrick flush up against the\n            wall, even starting to suck him in to the wall.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      No!!!\n\n            As Patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from\n            his father's grasp, he can see back across the room to the\n            others.  He sees the room as it really is - he can see what's\n            really happening.\n\n            Pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood\n            encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver\n            that's stroking Cinnabar's cheek and holding her close...\n\n            Jeremiah pulling Patrick into the wall, into the Necropolis\n            itself.  Patrick, though, just as concerned with Cinnabar as\n            with himself, yelling at her across the crib.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Cinnabar!  Stop!\n\n            But Cinnabar doesn't even turn her head.  She just steps into\n            her father's embrace.  But Pearl does seem to hear something.\n\n            She looks back at Patrick, beneath the illusion of the room\n            she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear\n            him more clearly now.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      No!  Cinnabar, no!!!!\n\n            Slowly, Pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a\n            full-length view of herself: a woman in ruined tatters of her\n            old, rotted dress.\n\n            Then, coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter\n            -- dancing with a decayed corpse.\n\n                                PEARL\n                      Noooooo!\n\n            Pearl whirls and rips Cinnabar away from Bones, who at first\n            sort of chuckles to himself.  But he stops laughing when\n            Pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her\n            breast.  In a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and Pearl\n            are engulfed in flames.\n\n                                BONES\n                      NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\n\n            Bones runs to Pearl and throws his arms around her, trying to\n            smother the flames any way he can.\n\n                                PEARL\n                          (to Patrick and Cinnabar)\n                      Get out!!!  Go!!!\n\n            Cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor, sees her mother in\n            flames.\n\n            Patrick desperately tries to escape his father's death grip. \n            Finally, with horrible sound, Patrick wrestles free from the\n            wall, and from his father.\n\n            He lurches free from them and makes it over to Cinnabar and\n            drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around\n            them.  As the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges\n            of Bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash.\n\n            An eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash\n            and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls.\n\n            Cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was\n            her mother and Bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a\n            shroud of flame and ash.\n\n            ANGLE AS\n\n            Patrick and Cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the\n            stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from Bones crib\n            giving everything a flickering hellish cat.\n\n            Everything behind and above them crumbling to dust.  The\n            floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped\n            inside.  \n\n            ON THE FIRST FLOOR\n\n            They reach the open elevator shaft.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      We gotta jump!\n\n                                CINNABAR\n                      I can't!\n\n            Everything around them rumbling and crumbling.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      We have to!\n\n            Patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes, dazed but unhurt.\n\n            LOOKING UP\n\n            He sees Cinnabar peering over the edge in fear.  Then, behind\n            her, he can hear a low rumbling growl.  He sees Cinnabar turn\n            and scream --\n\n            Ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes\n            his eyes and looks up, Cinnabar is gone from view.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Cinnabar!  Where are you!?\n\n            He immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees Cinnabar\n            standing at the edge of the shaft above him.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Cinn!  Jump!!\n\n            And she jumps, landing right next to Patrick, who quickly\n            gets her to her feet.\n\n                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n                      Let's go!!!\n\n            They run out of the shaft and into the sub-basement just as\n            the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash.\n\n            A hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now. \n            Mixed with the sound of all the screaming, moaning souls in\n            the Necropolis.\n\n            Patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris\n            blocking the exit.  \n\n            He pulls Cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar\n            stairs, step into the dawn, weary, beaten down but not dead.\n\n            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - DAY\n\n            They've made it out of the Inferno.  Like Dante said \"Thus we\n            emerged again to see the stars.\"  No stars here, just the\n            glorious dawn.\n\n            Patrick stops, feels the new sun on his face.  Breathes clean\n            air again for the first time.\n\n                                PATRICK\n                      We made it...\n\n            Then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might\n            be a low, low chuckle.  Jimmy Bones' chuckle.\n\n                                BONES (O.S.)\n                      Dog eat dog, boy.  Dog eat dog...\n\n            Patrick turns and spins in mounting horror.  There, behind\n            him, right where Cinnabar was standing...\n\n            The black dog.  It leaps right at the camera, filling the\n            frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue.  WE FREEZE.\n\n                                                          FADE TO BLACK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \n\t\t\tEND CREDITS\n\n\n\nback\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBones\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Adam Simon\u00a0\u00a0Tim Metcalfe\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:21:18.724933"}
