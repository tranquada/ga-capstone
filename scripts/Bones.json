Just one or two of\n            the eerie vapor lights left on the block.\n\n            A MIDDLE-AGED AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN carries his single bag of\n            groceries.  The man listens and watches carefully, as he\n            negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the\n            street.\n\n            We won't see his face until he reaches the next pool of\n            light, but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear.\n\n            Moving down the block, all shops abandoned.  Broken windows. \n            Rats.  The man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out\n            and crumpled in an abandoned doorway.  It's the crackhead we\n            saw mumbling himself into the nod-off zone.  He's still\n            faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes. \n            He stops in the light.\n\n            And we see it's SHOTGUN: 20 years of fear and loathing etched\n            on his face.  He freezes, listening for a second to the\n            crackheads wheezing mumbles - no - it's something else he's\n            listening for -- and hearing.\n\n            From behind him a low wheezy sound, like some huge panting\n            dog.  He stops.  And it stops.  He walks on and it follows:\n\n            As he hurries to the next pool of light and safety, his ears\n            strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily\n            following.\n\n            Suddenly, he hears that panting closer and closer until it's\n            nearly right behind him.  He starts running, though he hasn't\n            yet seen anything.  Only heard the mongrel hot on his heels.\n\n<b>            FOLLOW WITH SHOTGUN\n</b>\n            As he stumbles, careens, and wheezes through the streets and\n            alleys, terrified.  Winded, he eventually stops, his hand\n            trembling into his shopping bag, seeking a weapon.\n\n            And we see the building he's paused beside: Bones' place. \n            Pockmarked by age.  Like the face of some furious old man.\n\n            Now he can almost feel the dog's breath on the back of his\n            neck...Shotgun spins, whipping a bottle of milk out of the\n            bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him.\n\n            The bottle smashes against the wall of Bones' building.  For\n            a second, silhouetted against the now whited wall, the tall,\n            too tall, shape of the skinny black dog.\n\n            Without waiting to see what he hit, Shotgun takes off running\n            to reach his building across the street.  The sound of the\n            dog's nails skittering across the street right behind him --\n\n            -- and he just makes it --\n\n<b>            INT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            Inside, safe, panting for breath.  Then starts running up the\n            stairs...\n\n<b>            EXT. SHOTGUN'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            From outside his third floor window, we see Shotgun run into\n            his apartment, slam down his groceries on the counter, grab\n            an old rifle from under his bed and hurry to his open window.\n\n<b>            INT. SHOTGUN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            He scan/aims out his window across the street to the now\n            desolate building where Bones once lived.  Finger on the\n            trigger, eyes scanning the shadows for the dog.  Mumbling\n            quotations from the Bible about canines, some of which are\n            handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors:\n\n<b>                                SHOTGUN\n</b>                      \"Thou shalt not bring a dog into the\n                      house of the Lord thy God, for they are\n                      an abomination.\"  Deuteronomy.\n\n            Suddenly, something moving on the empty street catches his\n            eye.\n\n<b>            HIS ANGLE ON\n</b>\n            The Black Dog emerging from the shadows in the street.  Our\n            first good look at the beast.  Long clawed paws, all teeth\n            and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasn't eaten in\n            20 years.\n\n            It's long black head seems almost to be throbbing, moving\n            from within, almost subliminally we see a weirder, demonic,\n            more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur... Or is it\n            just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps?\n\n<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n</b>                          (as he aims his rifle)\n                      \"They return at evening: snarling like\n                      dogs and prowling the city...\" Psalms 59,\n                      vs. 6...\n\n            The dog stands in the pool of light, offering a perfect shot. \n            Shotgun smiles, aims, and then fires, making --\n\n<b>            EXT. BONES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            -- a direct hit!  But the dog doesn't move.  Unfazed.  The\n            bullet must have missed.  Or else gone right through him.\n\n            The long-faced dog just looks up at Shotgun like it was\n            laughing at the fool.  And has been for years.\n\n            Shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter. \n            Shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible\n            necessitates, and finds a half-dozen boxes of rifle rounds.\n\n            He calmly reloads the rifle.  And the sound of another shot\n            echoes in the night over...\n\n<b>            EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            Two frat boys, JASON and PALMER, driving a too nice car in a\n            too bad part of town.  Palmer at the wheel while Jason makes\n            a call on the cellular.\n\n<b>                                PALMER\n</b>                      Great.

It's STANK and WEAZE, both 17.\n\n<b>                                JASON\n</b>                      Let me see it.\n\n<b>                                STANK\n</b>                      Let me see it.\n\n<b>                                JASON\n</b>                          (hands him the money)\n                      Where is it?\n\n<b>                                STANK\n</b>                      I can't carry it in my pocket, man.

Bones' building.\n\n            Jason ignites a Zippo, and they see one loose brick.  Jason\n            pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy.\n\n<b>                                JASON\n</b>                      Easy as pie.

It's filled with rock cocaine.\n\n<b>            ANGLE - ACROSS THE STREET\n</b>\n            On the third floor, Shotgun sits in his straight-backed chair\n            in front of the open center window drinking coffee, cradling\n            his rifle on his lap.  Sees the frat boys picking up their\n            shit.  Then he looks out at Bone's 'tomb':\n\n            Dark blank windows staring back at him; the building's front\n            door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces\n            missing, looking almost like a jack-o-lantern's grin.\n\n            Shotgun then looks back down at the boys below.  From behind\n            them they hear their car alarm go off.\n\n<b>                                PALMER\n</b>                      Someone's screwing with the car!\n\n            But from the other way come cops, in a plain wrap car, a hand\n            reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof. \n            No place to run.  No place to hide for the boys.  They reach\n            for the door of the shuttered building -- and it opens!\n\n<b>                                SHOTGUN\n</b>                      Yo.

Mold grows in patches on the wall\n            and ceiling.  Huge cobwebs hang.  The furniture's all broken.\n\n            A gnawing tearing sound makes Palmer spin: a rat sticks its\n            head up through the rotted cushions of the couch.\n\n<b>                                PALMER\n</b>                      Let's get the hell outta here.\n\n            Jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing\n            blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street.\n\n            From inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and\n            cop shoes walking.\n\n<b>                                JASON\n</b>                      Oh fuck, c'mon...\n\n            He gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase.

And in the flickering we see\n            behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell:\n\n            It's not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper,\n            or the cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror.\n\n            All surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting pattern in which\n            we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people\n            were trapped on the surface of things.  Exactly like the\n            glimpse we had beneath the world when Jimmy died...\n\n            The floor, the walls, the furniture, everything in it -- made\n            out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms\n            of dead souls.  Their faces, hollow pleading eyes and howling\n            mouths visible like flowing grain in wood.\n\n            And in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of\n            Bones, impossibly tall and thin, stretching malevolently out\n            across the room like a living shadow.\n\n            But the boys don't see this as they're finding the door.  We\n            see Bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble.\n\n            Palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling\n            growl from the darkness on the other side.  And in the open\n            door stands the black dog.\n\n            They boys jump back.  But breathes easy.\n\n<b>                                PALMER (CONT'D)\n</b>                      Just a dog...\n\n            And the black dog leaps up at them -- teeth flying right for\n            the boys' throats.  And in the flickering ghastly light we\n            see its demon face breaking through.\n\n            The dog sinks his long teeth into Jason's arm.  He flails and\n            drops his lighter, still lit, on the floor.\n\n            As soon as he does, the dog releases Jason, and disappears as\n            fast as it appeared, back into the darkness.\n\n            The two kids panic, Jason shaking and bleeding, looking\n            around, waiting for the dog or something else to attack,\n            seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell.\n\n            Behind them we see that tall man-shaped shadow.  The Bones\n            shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys, intent only on\n            the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where\n            it fell against the lower wood paneling of the wall.\n\n            A thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to\n            catch on the chipped lead-filled flammable paint.\n\n<b>            THE BOYS RUN\n</b>\n            And stumble down the hall away from the horror, while back in\n            the room the Bones-shadow watches as the lighter flickers and\n            dies out.  Other than a slightly blackened spot, the wall is\n            unburned.\n\n            The black shadow shudders in rage, arches back and hooooowls\n            in frustration, its mouth abnormally large.  The shadowy head\n            snaps in the direction of the boys -- ready to vent it's\n            wrath, and for a subliminal second we see in the head, the\n            hellish face of Jimmy Bones.\n\n            The boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last\n            flight of stairs. \n            Jason's foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a\n            second, it appears as though rotten hands are just below the\n            stairs, grabbing at his foot and leg.\n\n            He yelps in terror, pulling his foot back as they continue\n            towards the front door, the Bones-thing's woofer-busting howl\n            roaring down from the third floor.\n\n<b>            THE SHEER INFINITE ADRENALINE RUSH\n</b>\n            Of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys\n            off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl\n            themselves out the front door into the night air... Jason\n            falling and lying on the stoop.\n\n<b>            EXT. BONES' BUILDING - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            Across the street, Shotgun sees the boys in the doorway. \n            Then, as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and\n            comes to life, the shadows created on Bones' building make it\n            look almost like a demonic face.\n\n            Gulping for air, laughing hysterically at their survival, the\n            frat boys pause.  Jason sits back on his butt, checking his\n            wound.  The doorway behind them just a black hole in space.\n\n<b>                                PALMER\n</b>                          (bumping fists together)\n                      Damn, bro.

His fingernails scraping along\n            the stoop in frenzied desperation.\n\n<b>            WITH SHOTGUN\n</b>\n            When he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from\n            across the street, he leaps to his feet and tries to see into\n            the dark of the doorway across the street.  But he can only\n            hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas:\n\n            Moans and the sound of flesh torn, and swallowed, and their\n            last dying screams.\n\n<b>            UP AND DOWN THE BLOCK\n</b>\n            The screaming reverberates.  Faces appear in some windows. \n            While in others, shades are drawn and the lights go out...\n\n<b>            BACK WITH SHOTGUN\n</b>\n            Mumbling to himself:\n\n<b>                                SHOTGUN\n</b>                      \"For outside are dogs and sorcerers...\"\n                      Revelation 22, vs. 15.\n\n            Tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away.\n\n<b>            LOOKING AT THE BUILDING\n</b>\n            It still has the shadowy look/shape of Jimmy Bones, now\n            shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out\n            again, plunging the street into near darkness.  The body of\n            Palmer no longer visible below.\n\n            When he looks back, the building seems just an old building\n            again.  Then there's movement in an upper window, catching\n            his eye.  Shotgun sees the tall, shadowy silhouette.\n\n            The figure is elongated, can't tell if it is a man, or the\n            distorted shadow of a man.  It beckons to Shotgun.\n\n<b>            SHOTGUN\n</b>\n            Just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the\n            shadowy thing across the street could hear him.\n\n<b>                                SHOTGUN (CONT'D)\n</b>                      You still mad?

She opens it: empty except a row of rusty metal\n            hangers, holding the moldy remains of Bones old suits.\n\n<b>            DOWNSTAIRS IN THE BASEMENT - PATRICK\n</b>\n            Is there a flashlight, poking around.  Trying to find the\n            metal knob to turn on the gas.  Eerie as hell down there.\n\n            Out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving,\n            looming.  A scurrying sound and Patrick turns his flashlight\n            in the other direction: we glimpse a bloated rat.\n\n            Behind him, the shadow we glimpsed grows, elongates.  Patrick\n            notes another door.  This one padlocked.  Sensing someone or\n            something behind him, Patrick turns with the flashlight.\n\n            Nothing there.  But the Bones-shadow is behind him again. \n            Again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight\n            around: nothing.\n\n            Except the Bones-shadow is again...behind him.\n\n            Shaking it off, Patrick heads for the old heater, pulling out\n            matches to light the pilot as Bones-shadow stays behind him.\n\n<b>            BONES POV\n</b>\n            Bones watches as Patrick reaches around the gas heater.  When\n            Patrick strikes a match head, the Bones-shadow moves even\n            closer to him as Patrick reaches in and lights the pilot.\n\n            When Patrick steps back, Bones-shadow grows and stretches,\n            spreading like an ink stain, reaching across to where the\n            pilot flame flickers.\n\n            In profile, the shadow-mouth blows...but no breath comes out. \n            The flame doesn't even flicker.\n\n            Bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of\n            frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth,\n            bigger than any human mouth, howling within the shadow-face.\n\n            The sound echoes all through the basement rooms as Patrick\n            walks back upstairs.  He slaps a nearby plumbing pipe.\n\n<b>                                PATRICK\n</b>                      Go on old pipes, groan all you like. \n                      Just please don't burst.

ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n            Bones' POV rises straight up as if still in a working\n            elevator.  It rises and we follow up from the basement to the\n            empty first floor, past the second floor to:\n\n<b>            THE THIRD FLOOR\n</b>\n            Where we're still inside, floating in the elevator cage. \n            Then the POV moves through the metal bars and floats towards\n            Bill, who's approaching the door of the room where Jimmy\n            died.\n\n            As Bill reaches to open it, Bones' POV floats closer - and\n            closer - right up on Bill's back now.  Bill feeling the hairs\n            on his neck suddenly rising.  Then he hears:\n\n<b>                                HOLLOW ECHOES\n</b>                      Go on.

Maurice stops to re-light his\n            joint when the Bones-shadow reaches out to grab his wrist.\n\n            But it's no good.  The shadow hand passes right through,\n            Maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something.\n\n            Maurice lights his roach, and the match burns closer and\n            closer to his fingertips.  Then singes them and he drops the\n            match.  Maurice then heads downstairs after Bill.\n\n            The shadow remains behind, staring at the still burning match\n            on the wooden floor.  He bends down, staring intently as if\n            willing it to burn, his hands urging it on, the flame\n            suddenly rising.  But then the match sputters harmlessly out. \n            The shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs.\n\n<b>            WHILE ON THE SECOND FLOOR\n</b>\n            Tia explores the rest of the floor.  Hears a sound, like a\n            whimpering, from behind another door.\n\n            She slowly eases open the door then jumps back -- Inside, the\n            dog.

And as he does we see the\n            Bones shadow rising behind her.  It seems to lean in and over\n            her, and the dog stops growling.\n\n            Tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger\n            for the dog to smell.\n\n            Bones' shadow from lingers behind her, perhaps simply\n            enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl.\n\n<b>                                TIA\n</b>                      How'd you get locked in here?

Or in the instant after\n            Jimmy's death: all surfaces seem to be a swirling, shifting\n            pattern in which we can dimly make out faces, as if people\n            were trapped on the surface of things.\n\n            Then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces\n            and into the room.  \n\n            So as Bill, eyes still closed, rocks to the hypnotic beats in\n            his headphones, we see the room around him begin to fill with\n            figures.\n\n            -- all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces\n            of floor and walls.

It\n            causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement.\n\n            The fire's light seems the very glow of hellfire behind Bones\n            as he marches up the stairs, razor in his hand.\n\n<b>            INT.

His arm raised with the razor. \n            And he flings it out, like a boomerang, the razor flies\n            around the room.\n\n            It swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids,\n            hacking at them through the smoke, like some savage bird,\n            though it doesn't seem intent on slaughtering them, but\n            rather herding them out.  Bill and Patrick pull Cinnabar and\n            Tia out the door -- they're the last in the room.\n\n            Suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid-air and zips back\n            into Bones' waiting fist - just like a boomerang.\n\n            Razor held high, Bones advances on them, steadily, cool as\n            ice amidst the now fully burning house.\n\n<b>            EXT.

He sees the room as it really is - he can see what's\n            really happening.\n\n            Pearl, not in a new dress, but in a horrible tattered, blood\n            encrusted old dress, standing next to a rotting cadaver\n            that's stroking Cinnabar's cheek and holding her close...\n\n            Jeremiah pulling Patrick into the wall, into the Necropolis\n            itself.

But Pearl does seem to hear something.\n\n            She looks back at Patrick, beneath the illusion of the room\n            she sees him being pulled into the awful wall, and can hear\n            him more clearly now.\n\n<b>                                PATRICK (CONT'D)\n</b>                      No!

But he stops laughing when\n            Pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her\n            breast.  In a terrible whoosh, the dried old dress and Pearl\n            are engulfed in flames.\n\n<b>                                BONES\n</b><b>                      NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!\n</b>\n            Bones runs to Pearl and throws his arms around her, trying to\n            smother the flames any way he can.\n\n<b>                                PEARL\n</b>                          (to Patrick and Cinnabar)\n                      Get out!!!

As the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges\n            of Bones' blood on it, the room begins to turn to ash.\n\n            An eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl, blowing the ash\n            and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls.\n\n            Cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was\n            her mother and Bones now, too, sees them almost lost in a\n            shroud of flame and ash.\n\n<b>            ANGLE AS\n</b>\n            Patrick and Cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the\n            stairs, the moon overhead and the flames from Bones crib\n            giving everything a flickering hellish cat.\n\n            Everything behind and above them crumbling to dust.
