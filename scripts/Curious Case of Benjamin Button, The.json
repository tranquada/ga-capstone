Queenie, in a white\n     uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and\n     apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient\n     faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing\n     eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come\n     to know... the face of a very old man...\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 21.\n\n33   CONTINUED:                                                  33\n\n     The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a\n     six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small,\n     shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with\n     arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a\n     hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one\n     ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are\n     sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the\n     last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we\n     watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might,\n     banging it just for the hell of it making noise...\n\n                                QUEENIE\n                  Stop bangin' that fork...\n                       (fixing it in his\n                        arthritic hand)\n                  It's for eating, not for playin'\n                  with... And use your napkin,\n                  please Mr. Benjamin...\n\n     And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of\n     the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man\n     having dinner with his contemporaries.\n\n34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34\n\n     A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six-\n     year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between\n     them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough,\n     sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making\n     him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the\n     other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking...\n     Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children\n     playing... people talking...\n\n                                  BENJAMIN BUTTON\n                  What's there?\n\n     Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally\n     curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself\n     precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall\n     is lower and he just sees the street... children running\n     on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off\n     for a party... He leans forward to get an even better\n     view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him...\n\n                                QUEENIE\n                  Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come\n                  back here...!\n\n     ...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the\n     safety of the old people... out of sight of the street...\n\n                                                                  22.\n\n\n\n35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35\n\n     The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in\n     a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed...\n\n                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)\n               I loved her very much. She was my\n               mother.\n\n     And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes\n     his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie\n     in bed, her \"son\", the \"old man\" on the floor...\n\n                             BENJAMIN BUTTON\n               Somedays I feel like I'm different\n               from the day before...\n\n                             QUEENIE\n               Everybody feels different about\n               themselves one way or another.\n               We're all goin' the same way, just\n               taking different roads to get\n               there... You're on your own road,\n               Benjamin.\n\n                             BENJAMIN BUTTON\n               How much longer do I have to live,\n               Mother?\n\n                             QUEENIE\n               Just be thankful you got what\n               you're given. You already here\n               longer than you supposed to be.\n\n     We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in...\n\n                             BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)\n               Some nights, I would have to sleep\n               alone.\n\n     He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying\n     him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy\n     going back down into the room to be with Queenie...\n     shutting the door...\n\n36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36\n\n     An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a\n     book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his\n     wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                       23.\n\n36   CONTINUED:                                                        36\n\n                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)\n                  I didn't mind.

I felt safe.\n\n     Be he still wants to know \"What's over there?\" He wheels\n     himself over to sit at the window looking outside...\n     looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate...\n     trying to see what's dangerous...\n\n                                BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.)

General Winslow,\n                  U.S. Army Retired... raised the\n                  flag...\n\n37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37\n\n     And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just\n     that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's\n     naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with\n     a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING\n     OPERA...\n\n                                BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.)\n                  Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted\n                  opera singer... well, she'd sing,\n                  Wagner...\n\n38   INT.
