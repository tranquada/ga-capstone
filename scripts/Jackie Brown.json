LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY\n   \n   We hear the rhythm of funky seventies SOUL MUSIC.\n   \n   Then SHE steps into FRAME.\n   \n   She is JACKIE BROWN, a stewardess dressed in her CABO AIR\n   uniform. (A little shuttle airline that flies from Los\n   Angeles to Cabo San Lucas. Approximate flight time: forty\n   five minutes)\n   \n   Jackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her\n   through the airport. The CREDITS APEAR and DISAPPEAR in\n   front of her.\n   \n   Jackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid\n   forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties.\n   \n   The people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps\n   off.\n   \n   She breezes through Customs and we follow her with a\n   STEDICAM as she strides through the airport... She gets\n   to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment\n   comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n                   (into mike)\n             Flight 710 Cabo San Lucas, now\n             boarding Gate 12, first class only.\n   \n   With a smile on her face, she collects passengers'\n   boarding passes as they board the plane.\n   \n                                               FADE TO BLACK\n   \n   \n   TITLE CARD\n   \n   \"ORDELL ROBBIE\"\n   \n                                               FADE UP ON:\n   \n   \n   EXT. FIRING RANGE - DAY\n   \n   VIDEO\n   \n   A chorus line of six beautiful bikini-clad women, all\n   holding different automatic weapons, BLASTING away.\n   \n   The cheap VIDEO TITLES to:\n   \n   \"CHICKS WHO LOVE GUNS\"\n   \n   Play over this image.\n   \n   One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous\n   brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera\n   holding a TEC-9 and describing it.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n                   (to camera)\n             Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.\n             The popular TEC-9 is advertised by\n             its makers as being tough as the\n             toughest customer.\n   \n   SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of\n   birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney\n   continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S\n   VOICE begins talking over the video.\n   \n                       BLACK MAN (O.S.)\n             That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass\n             spray gun outta South Miami.\n   \n   After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.\n   \n                       BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n             Cost three-eighty retail. I get them\n             for two hundred and sell 'em for\n             eight.\n   \n   \n   INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT\n   \n   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL\n   ROBBIE.\n   \n   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.\n   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather\n   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball\n   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's \"look.\" At\n   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.\n   \n   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.\n   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a\n   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)\n   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in\n   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.\n   \n   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the\n   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and\n   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the\n   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also\n   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in\n   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his\n   body language and his thought process.\n   \n   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a\n   correction facility, in the real world his timing is\n   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to\n   but attempt to sing anyway.\n   \n   The third person watching the video is the person who\n   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-\n   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like\n   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies\n   from the seventies like \"Pom Pom Girls\" \"Malibu Beach\"\n   and \"Beach Girls,\" except Melanie is older than any of\n   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-\n   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.\n   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of\n   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man\n   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.\n   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,\n   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who\n   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,\n   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.\n   \n   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in\n   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops\n   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,\n   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and\n   paying no attention to the video.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             This TEC-9? They advertise it as\n             being the most popular gun in\n             American crime. Can you believe that\n             shit? It actually says that on the\n             little booklet that comes with it.\n             \"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,\"\n             like they're proud of that shit.\n   \n   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.\n   \n   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a\n   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue\n   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Check out this body-builder chick...\n             Now see what she got. That's a Styer\n             aug. Styer Aug's a bad motherfucker.\n             Listen.\n   \n   Ordell punches up the volume.\n   \n   Cindy BLASTS the Styer Aug, loud.\n   \n   Ordell imitates the sound of the weapon.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Shit's expensive, man. Comes from\n             Austria. My customers don't know shit\n             about it, so there ain't no demand.\n                   (to Melanie)\n             Baby, I could use some more ice.\n   \n   Melanie puts down the magazine, takes his cocktail glass\n   from him and moves to the kitchen.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             But put that bad boy in a flick,\n             every motherfucker out there want\n             one. I'm serious as a heart attack.\n             Them Hong Kong movies came out, every\n             nigga gotta have a forty-five. And\n             they don't want one, they want two,\n             cause nigga want to be \"The Killer.\"\n             What they don't know, and that movie\n             don't tell you is a .45 has a serious\n             fuckin' jammin' problem. I always try\n             and steer a customer towards a 9-\n             millimeter. Damn near the same\n             weapon, don't have half the jammin'\n             problems. But some niggas out there,\n             you can't tell them anything. They\n             want a .45. The killer had a .45,\n             they want a .45.\n   \n   Melanie comes back, hands Ordell his screwdriver, then\n   sits where she was.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Thanks, Baby.\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             Who's your partner?\n   \n   Ordell sits down on the couch. Melanie's reading\n   \"Movieline Inside\" magazine.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Mr. Walker. He runs a fishing boat in\n             Mexico. I deliver the merchandise to\n             him, gets it to my customers. On all\n             my bulk sales, anyway.

He\n             got himself a yacht, with all kinds\n             of high tech navigational shit on it.\n                   (back to video)\n             AK-47, the very best there is.\n   \n   GLORIA, a tall, Amazonian, bikini-clad, black woman faces\n   camera and describes the AK-47.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             When you absolutely, positively,\n             gotta kill every motherfucker in the\n             room, accept no substitute.

Stop fuckin' wit ya!\n   \n   Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you\n             know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Naw, man. I gotta be someplace.

He locks his front door and walks\n   with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We\n   STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             What's the problem?\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Well, it ain't so much a problem a a\n             situation. Remember I sold those\n             three M-60 machine guns outta the\n             five I got?\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Uh-huh.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.\n             This group of Koreans in Koreatown\n             have started a Neighborhood Watch\n             kinda thing. And they want a few\n             weapons so the neighborhood niggas\n             know they mean business. So I'm gonna\n             sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.\n             Only problem, I aint never dealt with\n             these Koreans before. Now I aint\n             worried. Asians are by and large real\n             dependable. They don't want no\n             trouble. You might argue about price,\n             but you aint gotta worry about them\n             shootin' you in the back. But I got\n             me kind of a rule. Never do business\n             with nobody you ain't never done\n             business with before without backup.\n             That's why I need you, backup.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out\n             nowhere -\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             - Let me finish. Can I finish?\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Go ahead.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   TRUNK\n   \n   The trunk of a car is opened.\n   \n   Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump\n   action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part\n   of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as\n   a playing piece.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Now you're gonn be in the trunk\n             holding onto the shotgun. And I'm\n             going to tell them I'm opening up my\n             trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up\n             the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad\n             boy.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'\n             anybody.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             What the fuck I tell you. You don't\n             hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the\n             gun. They'll get the idea.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             I ain't gittin' in that trunk.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll\n             be in there - ten minutes.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk\n             no minutes. Why don't I just ride\n             with you?\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You can't ride with me. The surprise\n             effect is ninety percent of it.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't\n             gittin' in that trunk.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             I can't believe you do me this way.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             I ain't doin' you no way. I just\n             ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a\n             problem with small places.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Well, my ass has got a problem\n             spending ten thousand dollars of my\n             own goddam money to get ungrateful,\n             peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I\n             do it -\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Look, man, I know I owe you -\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             - Well, if you owe me, git your ass\n             in the trunk.\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             - I wanna help you, but I don't wanna\n             be locked in the trunk of no car.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You think I wanted to spend ten\n             thousand dollars on your ass?\n   \n   Beaumont starts to speak -\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Answer the question, nigga. Do you\n             think I wanted to spend the thousand\n             dollars on your ass? Yes or no?\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Course you didn't.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             But the only way to help you was to\n             do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,\n             how 'bout this? After we're through\n             fuckin' with these Koreans, I take\n             you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.\n             My treat.\n   \n   Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Just think, man. That Scoe's special,\n             smothered in gravy and onions. Get a\n             side of red beans and rice.\n             Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.\n   \n   Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;\n   \n                       BEAUMONT\n             Now exactly how long I gotta be in\n             this motherfucker.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   TRUNK\n   \n   Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid\n   is SLAMMED closed.\n   \n   \n   EXT. / INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT\n   \n   Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush\n   interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to\n   life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player\n   inside the dash.\n   \n   The tape is labeled \"ORDELL'S JAMS.\"\n   \n   Cool, old-school R&B fills the cab.\n   \n   Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and\n   mouthing the words.\n   \n   He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...\n   \n   ... then stops.\n   \n   Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab\n   goes black.\n   \n   He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A\n   tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the\n   only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.\n   \n   In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his\n   right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the\n   glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes\n   the glovebox.\n   \n   The cab goes black.\n   \n   \n   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT\n   \n   The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban\n   nowhere.\n   \n   Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and\n   walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the\n   trunk and says;\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Don't worry. It's just me.\n   \n   The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the\n   shotgun.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             I was wondering. Did any federal\n             people come visit you in jail and I\n             should be watching my ass?\n   \n   Beaumont doesn't say anything.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             You wouldn't tell me if they did and\n             I wouldn't blame you.\n   \n   Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.\n   \n   Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,\n   and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He\n   racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in\n   the chest. He goes back into he trunk.\n   \n   Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the\n   weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.\n   \n   Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into\n   the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B\n   song come back on, but VERY LOW.\n   \n   Ordell drives the Olds away.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   INT.

MOTEL - NIGHT\n   \n   Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside\n   his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked\n   in front of the motel.\n   \n   As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side\n   comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back\n   in his seat looking up at Louis.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You know what your problem is, Louis?\n   \n   Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his\n   pockets.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             You think you're a good guy.

And it ain't cause you're\n             scared neither. It's cause you think\n             you're a good guy, and you think\n             there's certain things a good guy\n             won't do.

Shot\n             twice. Once in the head and once in\n             the chest.\n   \n   Jackie, she puts the \"ool\" in \"cool.\"\n   \n                       NICOLET (O.S.) (CONT'D)\n             I had the chance to talk to Beaumont\n             yesterday. You see, like you,\n             Beaumont found himself in some hot\n             water. He was looking at ten years he\n             was pretty sure he didn't want to do\n             and was understandably concerned. Now\n             maybe you don't know Beaumont, but\n             Beaumont knew you, and maybe so does\n             the guy who blew Beaumont's head off.\n   \n   Not a word.\n   \n                       DARGUS (O.S.)\n             If you don't want to talk to us, I\n             guess we'll just have to hand you\n             over to Customs.\n   \n   Jackie puts out her cigarette.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Okay, let's go.\n   \n   She stares down the cops.\n   \n   \n   DARGUS AND NICOLET\n   \n   We cut to the detective and the special agent for the\n   first time in the scene.\n   \n                       DARGUS\n             You know, Miss Brown, there's\n             basically three types of people that\n             we come along in the performance of\n             our duty. One is, INNOCENT PEOPLE.\n             Victims, witnesses, innocent\n             bystanders... You ain't any of these.\n             Then there's two; CRIMINALS. These\n             sonabitches have dedicated their\n             lives to a life outside the law. That\n             ain't you either. Where you belong is\n             the third category. The category we\n             refer to as LOSERS.\n   \n   Jackie's eyes don't even narrow at the insult. She just\n   says without expression;\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I'm not a loser.\n   \n                       DARGUS\n             Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were\n             flying for TWA and got busted for\n             carrying drugs. You were carrying\n             them for a pilot husband of yours. He\n             did time and you got off. But that\n             ended your career with the big\n             airlines. Cut to thirteen years\n             later. You're forty-four years of\n             age. You're flying for the shittiest\n             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit\n             Mexican airline that there is. Where\n             you make a whopping twelve-thousand\n             dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva\n             lot to show for a twenty year career.\n             And to top it off, you're going to\n             jail. Now true, the judge, even with\n             your prior, will probably only give\n             you a year or two. But this doesn't\n             seem like the time of life you got\n             years to throw away.\n                   (pause)\n             Now, we don't like trying losers like\n             they're criminals. But in the absence\n             of a criminal, we will try you. Now,\n             wasn't this money given to you by an\n             American living in Mexico by the name\n             of Cedric Walker?\n   \n   Jackie remains unmoved by this monologue.\n   \n   Nicolet joins back in.\n   \n                       NICOLET\n             You know, ol' Beaumont wasn't much\n             for talkin', either. Yeah, he told us\n             about you and Mr. Walker, but whoever\n             the hell it was he worked for out\n             here, he wouldn't say. Could it be\n             the same person you were supposed to\n             deliver this money to?\n   \n   Jackie just stares at them, saying nothing.\n   \n   Dargus sits behind his desk, with Jackie's flight bag on\n   it.\n   \n                       DARGUS\n             I'd like your permission to open this\n             again. So we'll know exactly how much\n             money we're talkin' about here.\n   \n   Jackie gets up from her chair, walks over to the desk,\n   unzips the bag, takes out the manila envelope and drops\n   it on the desk.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Help yourself.\n   \n                       DARGUS\n             While you're at it, let me see what\n             else is in there.

You\n             want to stay out of jail, don't you?\n   \n   Max looks at Jackie thinking about something.\n   \n                       MAX (CONT'D)\n             What'dya think?\n   \n   \n   CLOSEUP JACKIE\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I think maybe I have more options\n             than I thought.\n   \n                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n   \n   \n   CLOSEUP: ORDELL\n   \n   Sitting in his black Mercedes, parked across the street\n   from Jackie's apartment building in Hawthorne. Johnny\n   Cash is playing inside his car.\n   \n   \n   EXT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT\n   \n   ORDELL'S POV\n   \n   Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue\n   Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets\n   out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window\n   of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture\n   and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives\n   off.\n   \n   \n   ORDELL\n   \n   While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his\n   gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little\n   Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the\n   pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him\n   as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once\n   inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND\n   HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.\n   \n   He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a\n   moment, then Jackie opens the door.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             How you doing, Ms. Jackie?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I was expecting you. Come in.\n   \n   Jackie holds the door open for him.\n   \n   \n   INT. JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n   \n   Ordell steps inside. He moves over by a halogen lamp in\n   the living room.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You got some booze?\n   \n   Jackie still standing by the door. She doesn't look\n   frightened.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I got some vodka in the freezer.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Got some o.j.?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Yeah.\n   \n   Ordell turns the halogen lamp to dim.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Well, then, why don't you be a good\n             hostess and make me a screwdriver?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Sure.\n   \n   Jackie moves into the kitchen area. Ordell follows her,\n   hanging in the doorway, while she makes the drink. Jackie\n   doesn't turn on the light.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You gonna thank me?\n   \n   Taking a glass from the cupboard.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             For what?\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Who you think got your ass outta\n             jail?\n   \n   Opening the freezer and filling a glass with ice cubes\n   and taking out vodka.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             The same guy who put me in, thanks a\n             lot.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Hey, you get caught with blow, that's\n             our business.\n   \n   Opens refrigerator, light cuts into the kitchen. She\n   takes out orange juice, then closes the door.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             It wasn't mine.\n   \n   Ordell has to stop and think.\n   \n   Jackie makes screwdriver.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Oh, shit. I bet it was that present\n             Mr. Walker was sending Melanie.\n             Yaaaah, he's the one musta put it in\n             there if you didn't. Oh, man, that\n             shit's uncalled for, baby, and I\n             apologize. I 'magine they asked you a\n             shitload of questions about it, huh?\n             All that money, want to know where\n             you got it?\n   \n   Jackie doesn't answer. She just walks up to Ordell\n   handing him his yellow drink in the darkness. Ordell\n   takes it, continues to look at Jackie.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             I'magine they asked who you givin' it\n             to, too.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             They asked.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             And what was your answer?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You positive about that? You weren't\n             nervous and let something slip by\n             mistake? If you did, I ain't mad, I\n             just gotta know.\n   \n   Jackie says to his face;\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             You're not asking the right\n             questions.\n   \n   Then she walks past him back to the living room. She goes\n   over to the halogen lamp, turning the light up brighter,\n   then moves by the door, still standing and looking at\n   Ordell in the kitchen doorway.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Beaumont Livingston.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             I knew it.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.\n   \n   Ordell by the halogen lamp. He turns it back to dim.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Yeah?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I didn't tell 'em anything.\n   \n   Ordell moves slowly towards Jackie.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             My name come up?\n   \n   Jackie slowly shakes her head \"no.\"\n   \n   Ordell directly in front of Jackie, he gently places his\n   gloved hands on her shoulders.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             You say anything about me?\n   \n   Jackie shakes her head \"no.\"\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             Well, that's mighty honorable of you.\n   \n   Ordell's gloved fingertips move up her collarbone to her\n   throat, gently touching her skin. Jackie locks eyes with\n   his, but still shows no fear.\n   \n                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n             This fella Beaumont, they say what\n             happened to him?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             They told me.\n   \n   At this moment the film becomes a:\n   \n   \n   SPLIT SCREEN\n   \n   On the RIGHT-HAND SIDE is Ordell with his hands barely\n   touching Jackie's throat. On the LEFT-HAND SIDE is Max\n   driving home in his Seville.\n   \n   \n   MAX IN CAR\n   \n   Max drives home, an almost moony romantic look no his\n   face. He can't stop thinking about Jackie. During the\n   night she'd have a gleam in her eyes, the look saying;\n   \"WE COULD HAVE FUN\". Unless she was appraising kinda him\n   with the look, making a judgment and what it said was; \"I\n   COULD USE YOU\". Either way it was a turn-on.\n   \n   Max pulls into the driveway of his small house in\n   Torrance.\n   \n   \n   ORDELL AND JACKIE\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Yeah, somebody musta been real mad at\n             Beaumont. Or  they were afraid of\n             what he might say to keep from doin\n             some time. I'magine from time-to-time\n             they asked you a whole shitload of\n             questions. And you didn't give 'em no\n             answer?\n   \n   Jackie shakes her head from side to side.\n   \n   Ordell moves his thumbs from her collarbone to the middle\n   of her throat.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You scared of me?\n   \n   Jackie shakes her head from side to side without her eyes\n   leaving his. Reaches over the seat\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             You got a reason to be nervous with\n             me?\n   \n   With his hands on Jackie's throat, staring into the\n   woman's eyes, from BELOW FRAME then feels something hard\n   the fuck against his crotch. Neither break eye contact.\n   \n   Ordell hears a CLICK.\n   \n   Can't believe it.\n   \n   \n   MAX IN CAR\n   \n   Max takes his keys, then to the glove box...\n   \n   \n   THE GLOVE BOX\n   \n   The gun is gone.\n   \n                       MAX\n             Where is it?\n   \n   \n   A CLOSEUP OF MAX'S GUN IN ORDELL ORDELL'S CROTCH\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Is that what I think it is?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             What do you think it is?\n   \n   \n   CLOSEUP GUN IN CROTCH\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             I think it's a gun pressing against\n             my dick.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             You thought right... Now take your\n             hands from around my throat, nigga.\n   \n   Ordell flashes his hustler's smile and lets go.\n   \n   END OF SPLIT SCREEN\n   \n   Jackie turns Ordell around, gun firmly in his back, and\n   pushes him against the wall.\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             What the hell you doin'?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Shut your ass up and grab the wall!\n   \n   Jackie has Ordell against the wall and is frisking him\n   the way a cop would. She finds the .22 pistol in his\n   pocket\n   \n                       ORDELL\n             Now, baby, that's got nothin' to do\n             with you. I just carry that.

Jackie in a bathrobe steps into FRAME\n   and opens the door. She says to the yet-unseen-by-camera\n   visitor;\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             You want your gun, don't you? Come\n             in. I'll go get it.\n   \n   She leaves FRAME, and Max enters it, closing the door\n   behind him. Max stands by the door, a little surprised\n   and a touch pissed at the nonchalantness.\n   \n   As he stands on the threshold to her living room, waiting\n   for her to return with the gun, feeling foolish, he\n   thinks about hauling her ass back to the stockade.\n   That'll change her expression, he'd bet.\n   \n   She returns from the bedroom, gun in hand, wearing a sort\n   of sad smile.\n   \n                       JACKIE (CONT'D)\n             Max, I'm sorry. I was afraid if I\n             asked to borrow it you'd say no.\n             You'd have to. Would you like some\n             coffee?\n   \n   Then, as quickly as the anger rose in Max, it dissipates\n   completely, leaving only curiosity.\n   \n                       MAX\n             If you're having some.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I am.

But I can't afford to\n             start all over again. I got too much\n             time and money invested in my\n             records.\n   \n   The song starts; it's an old romantic soul music number\n   from the early seventies.\n   \n                       MAX\n             Yeah, but you can't get new stuff on\n             records.\n   \n   Jackie picks up her cigarettes off the coffee table.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I don't buy new stuff that often.\n   \n   Jackie enters the kitchen door frame by Max.

She pulls down two mugs from a cabinet.\n   \n                       JACKIE (CONT'D)\n             He had his doubts at first.

He can't trust his other\n             people. They're crooks. He can try\n             bringing I in himself, but Ordell\n             sure don't want to go through no\n             Customs line. Either he recruits\n             another Cabo stewardess, or he\n             continues to trust me. I made him\n             feel he still can.\n   \n   Jackie walks to the table with the two coffee mugs and\n   sits down.\n   \n                       MAX\n             How do you get it out?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Same way I been don', but first they\n             got to let me go back to work.\n   \n                       MAX\n             You're gonna offer to set him up?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             If I get let off.

It started falling out ten\n             years ago. So I did something about\n             it.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             How'd you feel about it?\n   \n                       MAX\n             I'm fine with it, or I wouldn't of\n             done it, I did it to feel better\n             about myself, and I do.

The best job I\n             could get after my bust was Cabo Air,\n             which is about the worst job you can\n             get in this industry. I make about\n             sixteen thousand, with retirement\n             benefits , ain't worth a damn. And\n             now with this arrest hanging over my\n             head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I\n             gotta start all over again, but I got\n             nothin to start over with. I'll be\n             stuck with whatever I can get.

But I knew this narcotics\n             cop one time. Told me that in a raid,\n             the whole package never gets back to\n             the station.

He's a young guy\n             havin' fun being a cop. I know the\n             type, trust me on this. He's more\n             interested in Ordell than the money.\n             If he's gonna do anything suspect,\n             it'll be cutting corners to get the\n             conviction; but he wouldn't walk off\n             with the money. It's evidence.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             What about you Max?\n   \n                       MAX\n             What? If I was in Nicolet's place?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             No, I mean you, right now.

It\n             wouldn't even be missed.\n   \n                       MAX\n             A half-a-million dollars will always\n             be missed.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             You're avoiding the question.\n   \n                       MAX\n             Okay, sure.

Knowing\n   they must be Nicolet and Dargus, he watches one of them\n   take the Broadway bag from Jackie and look inside. They\n   talk for a minute - it would seem about nothing too\n   serious.

The\n   older woman says something, and the younger woman hands\n   her the ashtray Jackie was using.\n   \n   Max watches the Young Girl finish her food and get up\n   from the table. She stoops down to get the Broadway\n   shopping bag and walks out of the food court.\n   \n   Max watches Nicolet and Dargus let the Young Girl get a\n   little ahead, then follow after her. They're gone.\n   \n   Max turns back on the older woman all alone.\n   \n   She finishes the coffee she was drinking and stands up,\n   carrying - how about that? - A Broadway shopping bag.

JACKIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n   \n   Max sits on the couch in Jackie's apartment drinking\n   white wine.\n   \n   Jackie paces in front of him, white wine in one hand,\n   Davidoff in the other, going over the details of\n   tomorrow. One could notice a slight change in Jackie.\n   \n   There's a bit of an edge to Miss Brown that's bubbling\n   underneath her cool surface. It's understandable. After\n   all, she's been the architect of this half-a-million\n   dollars switcheroo. She's moved heaven and earth to make\n   all the pieces fall into place, and all the players thnk\n   what she wants them to think.\n   \n   As she talks to Max she knows tomorrow all her hard work\n   will either fail or succeed. But don't take this\n   difference the wrong way. This edge I'm referring to is\n   not one born out of fear (Jackie's nervous, but she's not\n   afraid). It's more the edge an athlete might feel before\n   an all-important competition.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             I told them Ordell's changed the\n             amount he's bringing in.\n   \n                       MAX\n             Do you think they bought it?\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Oh, yeah. I got them thinking\n             Ordell's real nervous. They love\n             thinking he's scared of them.\n   \n                       MAX\n             You know, a good cop won't let you\n             know he knows you're fulla shit.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             All he needed was a reasonable\n             explanation.\n   \n                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n   \n   \n   BACK TO JACKIE WITH NICOLET\n   \n   MEDIUM JACKIE\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Right. Everything's the same except\n             one change. Ordell thinks it's just\n             too hot right now to bring in all his\n             money. He knows you're watching him,\n             and he's paranoid. He's keeping his\n             stash where it is, but he wants to\n             bring in fifty thousand for bail in\n             case he needs it.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   BACK TO JACKIE AND MAX\n   \n                       MAX\n             It'll be more than that.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.\n   \n                       MAX\n             But you still have to show him the\n             money at the airport.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Well, you know I'm not going to show\n             him the whole amount.

He'll be expecting fifty\n             thousand and there it is - on top.\n   \n                       MAX\n             You're takin' a helluva chance kid.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr.\n             Walker put the money in, and I didn't\n             know nothing about it.

Nothing to worry 'bout\n             - everything's the same - except for\n             one change. That bitch you saw in the\n             mall, Simone.

They're\n   watching \"Dirty Mary and Crazy Larry\" on TV.\n   \n   \n   ON TV\n   \n   Peter Fonda and Susan George make jokes as they're\n   pursued by police cars.\n   \n   They can hear Ordell on the phone. Melanie smiling at\n   Louis, flirtatiously and conspiratorially lifts her bare\n   foot and rubs his arm with it. Louis turns to her and\n   gives her a look that says: \"I'm not on your side, bitch.\n   So knock it of.\"\n   \n   Melanie sees this and takes her foot away.\n   \n   Louis turns back to the television.\n   \n   \n   CLOSEUP MELANIE\n   \n   Looks at Louis for a moment, then sighs, saying under her\n   breath;\n   \n                       MELANIE\n             Chicken shit.\n   \n                                               FADE TO BLACK\n   \n   \n   TITLE CARD:\n   \n   \"MONEY EXCHANGE 550,000\"\n   \n                                               FADE UP:\n   \n   \n   A GRAPHIC MAP\n   \n   With Mexico and California on it.

He looks around, confused.\n   \n                       MELANIE (CONT'D)\n                   (like a teacher on Romper\n                   Room)\n             Nooo, that's towards Sears. We came\n             in through Bullocks. I know where it\n             is. Want to follow me, Lou-is?\n   \n   Pissed, he leaves FRAME. Melanie, wearing her Melanie\n   smirk, follows behind.\n   \n   \n   EXT. PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY\n   \n   Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,\n   walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.\n   \n   Melanie follows close behind.\n   \n   We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes\n   direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We\n   see he has a searching look on his face.\n   \n                       MELANIE\n             You have no idea where you parked, do\n             you?\n   \n   Louis doesn't answer.\n   \n   Melanie laughs.\n   \n                       MELANIE (CONT'D)\n             Jesus, but if you two aren't the\n             biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my\n             life... How did you ever rob a bank?\n             When you robbed banks, did you have\n             to look for your car then too? No\n             wonder you went to jail.\n   \n   Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of\n   his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But\n   instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.\n   He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and\n   saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for\n   what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another\n   aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck\n   up.\n   \n   But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.\n   \n                       MELANIE (CONT'D)\n             Is it this aisle, Lou-is?\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             Yeah, down the end.\n   \n                       MELANIE\n             You sure?\n   \n   They walk it; it's not it.\n   \n   Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the\n   next one.\n   \n                       MELANIE (CONT'D)\n             Is it this aisle or the next one\n             over?\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             This one.\n   \n                       MELANIE\n             You sure?\n   \n   In between two cars, Louis spins on her.\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             Don't say anything else, okay? I'm\n             telling you, keep your mouth shut.\n   \n   Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say\n   something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'\n             word.\n   \n                       MELANIE\n             Okay, Lou-is.\n   \n   That did it!\n   \n   Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots\n   her... BAM... in the belly.\n   \n   She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.\n   \n   BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.\n   \n   One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.\n   \n   Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF\n   HIM.

Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,\n   and yells through the passenger window;\n   \n                       LOUIS\n             Hey, look.

He walks up to a jewelry\n   counter and begins looking at he pieces in the display\n   case, when a pretty, young SALESGIRL comes up to him.\n   \n                       SALESGIRL\n             Can I show you something?\n   \n                       MAX\n             Not right now.

Then she\n   lifts her eyes, meeting Max's across the room. Max gives\n   her a nod of his head to show he approves. Jackie smiles\n   and breaks contact, turning to Amy. We hear her say from\n   a distance. \"This looks pretty good on me.\"\n   \n   Max hears a commotion behind him and turns to see Louis\n   and Melanie hurriedly making their way towards Designer\n   Clothes.\n   \n   He turns his attention back to browsing through dresses\n   on a rack.\n   \n   He sees Louis and Melanie squabbling.\n   \n   He sees Jackie disappear into the fitting room.\n   \n   He sees Amy leaving the fitting room entrance.\n   \n   He watches Melanie, by herself, watch Amy leave. Melanie\n   watches the fitting room for a few moments. Gathering her\n   courage, then makes her move, entering the fitting room.\n   \n   Max smiles to himself, \"so far so good\" he thinks. He\n   throws a look towards Louis, only to see Louis staring\n   dead at him with an unhappy look on his face.

Jackie goes into her act, acting\n   agitated and distracted as she talks to Amy, pays with\n   cash, then leaves stopping to say;\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Oh, somebody left a shopping bag in\n             there.

You've spent nineteen\n             years dealing with people who take\n             incredible risks.

Sitting in the corner is\n   the Robinson's/May bag. He walks over to it, lifts out\n   the towels, and sees all that money. He replaces the\n   towels, picks up the bag and leaves.

PARKING LOT - DEL AMO MALL - DAY\n   \n   He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking\n   towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,\n   never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the\n   car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.\n   \n   It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.\n   He made it.

I've had my eye on\n             this suit - Wait, let's start over. I\n             got there early. The idea was to try\n             on the suit, see if I liked it. If I\n             did, get them to wrap it up, and\n             change back into my uniform. That's\n             what Sheronda's expecting me to wear.\n             Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag\n             with fifty thousand, and go home.\n   \n                       NICOLET\n             But you didn't do that.\n   \n                       JACKIE\n             Because I didn't have it.

What am I\n             supposed to do, go after her? I'm in\n             my fucking underwear.
