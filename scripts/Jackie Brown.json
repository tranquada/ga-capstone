MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b><b>   \n</b>   The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL\n<b>   ROBBIE.\n</b><b>   \n</b>   Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.\n   Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather\n   jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball\n   caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's \"look.\" At\n   this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.\n<b>   \n</b>   Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.\n   (the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a\n   cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)\n   and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in\n   his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.\n<b>   \n</b>   LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the\n   Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and\n   dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the\n   video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also\n   in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in\n   penal institutions. The experience has affected both his\n   body language and his thought process.\n<b>   \n</b>   While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a\n   correction facility, in the real world his timing is\n   thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to\n   but attempt to sing anyway.\n<b>   \n</b>   The third person watching the video is the person who\n   lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-\n   three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like\n   the kind you se in the old Crown International movies\n   from the seventies like \"Pom Pom Girls\" \"Malibu Beach\"\n   and \"Beach Girls,\" except Melanie is older than any of\n   those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-\n   uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.\n   So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of\n   lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man\n   more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.\n   In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,\n   film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who\n   kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,\n   Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.\n<b>   \n</b>   But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in\n   Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops\n   in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,\n   smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and\n   paying no attention to the video.\n<b>   \n</b><b>                       ORDELL\n</b>             This TEC-9? They advertise it as\n             being the most popular gun in\n             American crime. Can you believe that\n             shit? It actually says that on the\n             little booklet that comes with it.\n             \"Most Popular Gun in American Crime,\"\n             like they're proud of that shit.\n<b>   \n</b>   Ordell hits the fast-forward on his remote control.\n<b>   \n</b>   Sidney is rushed off the screen and replace by CINDY, a\n   pretty, blonde bodybuilder clad in a red, white and blue\n   bikini, holding a Styer Aug.\n<b>   \n</b><b>                       ORDELL (CONT'D)\n</b>             Check out this body-builder chick...\n             Now see what she got.

He\n             did time and you got off. But that\n             ended your career with the big\n             airlines. Cut to thirteen years\n             later. You're forty-four years of\n             age. You're flying for the shittiest\n             little shuttle-fucking piece of shit\n             Mexican airline that there is. Where\n             you make a whopping twelve-thousand\n             dollars a year.
