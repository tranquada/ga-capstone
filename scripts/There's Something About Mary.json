Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too\nhard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender\nand gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the\nend zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another\ndefender.\n\n--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED\nINCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH.

She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just\nLAUGHS.\n\n--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a\nromantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but\nhe's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are\nspraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND\nWEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.\n\n--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't\nlooking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In\nthe b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.\n\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT\n\nA content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently\nlistening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the\nnewspaper.\n\n                        MAGDA (V.O.)\n           I'm buying bananas tonight.\n\n                        MARY (V.O.)\n           Why?\n\n                        MAGDA (V.O.)\n           Back when I was your age I always used to\n           make myself a big banana split after sex. I\n           think you're gonna need one tonight.\n\n                        MARY (V.O.)\n           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll\n           probably need it before I will.\n\nINT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME\n\nMary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the\ncouch.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap\n           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an\n           oyster shucker.\n\n                        MARY\n           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to\n           take you to the movies.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're\n           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to\n           be.\n\n                        MARY\n           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this\n           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.\n\nBACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.\n\n                        MARY (V.O. )\n           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a\n           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.\n\nHealy loses the smile and sits up.\n\n                        MAGDA (V.O.)\n           An old flame?\n\n                        MARY (V.O.)\n           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest\n           guys in the world.\n\nHealy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.\n\nON MARY\n\n                        MARY (cont'd)\n           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major\n           crush on him.\n\nBACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He\ngrabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.\n\n                        HEALY\n           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)\n           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that\n           reminds me, I've got to call\n           what's-his-face and cancel.\n\nON MARY\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Do I sense a chill in the air?\n\nMary sits down.\n\n                        MARY\n           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of\n           my love life. I always pick guys on what I\n           feel in here.\n                 (pats heart)\n           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying\n           \"Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common\n           with this one, you'll grow to feel\n           something for him.\" But it never happened.\n\nON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular\nphone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.\nPanic-stricken. Then he answers it.\n\n                        HEALY\n                 (jovial voice)\n           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but\n           I'm out rustling up some champagne and\n           roses in preparation for the greatest\n           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are\n           having a good day, too.\n\nHealy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.\n\nON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.\n\n                        MARY\n           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to\n           say I'm...looking forward to tonight.\n\nShe hangs up.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at\n           night?\n\n                        MARY\n           I can't do it--I just found out it's his\n           birthday.\n                 (sighs)\n           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.\n\nON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then\nhe sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he\nhears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog\nYAPPING.\n\nON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's\nTucker, the architect.\n\n                        MARY\n                 (surprised)\n           Tucker...come on in.\n\nBACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller\ncoaster heading downhill.\n\n                        MAGDA (V.O.)\n           Well look who's here.\n\nBACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE\nOF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.\n\n                        TUCKER\n           There she is--I brought you a little\n           thirst-quencher, Mag.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Oh, you are sweet.\n\n                        TUCKER\n           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk\n           so you'll pass out and I can have my way\n           with Mary.\n\nEveryone LAUGHS.\n\n                        MARY\n           Can I pour you one?\n\n                        TUCKER\n           Thanks, but I've got to be going.\n           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social\n           visit.\n\nTucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.\n\n                        MARY\n           What's up?\n\n                        TUCKER\n           Well...I've got a little more news about\n           your friend Healy.\n\nMary seems relieved.\n\n                        MARY\n           I know what you're going to say, but he\n           already told me everything. I know he's not\n           an architect.\n\nTucker pulls out a piece of paper.\n\n                        TUCKER (cont'd)\n           I think you'd better sit down.\n\n                        MARY\n           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,\n           but I'm really strapped for time here and--\n\n                        TUCKER\n           Mary, the man's a killer.\n\nON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.\n\nBACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.\n\n                        MARY\n                 (stunned)\n           What...?\n\n                        TUCKER\n           I've got a friend in the Boston police\n           department. He faxed me this this morning.\n           I'll just give you the highlights.\n                 (reading from rap sheet)\n           After a short stint as a petty thief,\n           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery\n           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he\n           committed his first murder--a pretty\n           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He\n           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,\n           despite a grim psychological profile, the\n           state was forced to release him. In his\n           mid-twenties and again in his early\n           thirties he was suspected of homicides in\n           the states of Utah and Washington.\n           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly\n           decomposed that there wasn't enough\n           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so\n           forth and so on.\n\nMary looks like she's going to throw up.\n\nON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.\n\n                        MARY (V.O.)\n           Holy shit...\n\n                        MAGDA (V.O.)\n           Puffy, get over here.\n\nWe hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a\nLOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.\n\nON MARY\n\n                        MARY\n           Magda!\n\n                        MAGDA\n           The little shit lied to me about that guy!\n\nMary picks up the startled dog and pets him.\n\n                        MARY\n                 (growing emotional)\n           I can't believe this is happening. I'm\n           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.\n\n                        TUCKER\n           Okay, just calm down. It's going to be\n           okay.\n\nTucker puts his arms around her.\n\n                        MAGDA\n           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.\n\nMary looks fondly at Tucker.\n\n                        MARY\n           Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in\n           my life.\n\n                        TUCKER\n           Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give\n           me a big head.\n                 (smiles)\n           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got\n           to distance yourself as much as possible\n           without pissing this psycho off.\n\n                        MARY\n           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to\n           do. I'll call him right now.\n\nBACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He\nstares at it, then picks it up.\n\n                        HEALY\n           Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and\n           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a\n           message. BEEP.\n\n                        MARY (V.O.)\n                 (nervous)\n           Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're\n           not going to believe this--well, you'll\n           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I\n           just got beeped for emergency surgery.\n           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to\n           bail on you.\n\nAs we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.\n\n                                                    DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

He rounds a corner, then stops next\nto an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker\nDUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into\ntraffic and follows.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\nINT.
