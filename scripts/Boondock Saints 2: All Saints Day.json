You\n                     got your talkers and you got your\n                     doers.\n\n          \n          We recognize this man as ROCCO.

All they\n                     got is talk. But when all's said and\n                     done, it is the doers who change the\n                     world. And when they do that, they\n                     change us. That's why we never forget\n                     them...So, which one are you? Do you\n                     just talk about it?
