It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,\r\n           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling\r\n           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something\r\n           profoundly English.\r\n           We are a very long way from Hollywood.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3 EXT.

DAY. 3B\r\n\r\n           As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front\r\n           of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,\r\n           Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a\r\n           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the\r\n           painting.\r\n\r\n                          KENNETH\r\n           ... and this is one of Carracci's\r\n           earlier works and one is able to\r\n           see the emergence of his now famous\r\n           Baroque style, which is clearly\r\n           rooted in the tradition of high\r\n           renaissance and antiquity...\r\n           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the\r\n           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The\r\n           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams\r\n           affectionately.\r\n\r\n                          KENNETH\r\n           Colin! Come in. Have you met James\r\n           and Anna? Two very brilliant\r\n           pupils.\r\n           He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a\r\n           little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no\r\n           time to waste.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm leaving for London now, Pa.\r\n\r\n                          KENNETH\r\n           Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear\r\n           boy...\r\n           He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to\r\n           walk him back to the door.\r\n\r\n                          KENNETH\r\n           I can always get you a research\r\n           position at the V&A when you've\r\n           grown up a bit and got this film\r\n           idea out of your system...\r\n           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into\r\n           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           Kenneth, you might have told Cook\r\n           we were another two for dinner.\r\n           What is everyone supposed to eat?\r\n           Cabbage soup?

COLIN smiles\r\n           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as\r\n           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3C INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. GARDEN.

There's\r\n           nothing to eat but I'm sure the\r\n           conversation will be charming.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I don't want to be late in the\r\n           morning.\r\n           As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an\r\n           elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning\r\n           evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           I'm sure they won't mind.

DAY. 4\r\n\r\n           The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.\r\n           COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in\r\n           the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but\r\n           racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her\r\n           attention fully to him for the first time.\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           Now go and have a lovely time,\r\n           darling. We're always here when\r\n           you're ready to talk your future.\r\n           COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out\r\n           JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house\r\n           with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook\r\n           and ask her how many pork chops we\r\n           need for tonight. Then bring the\r\n           car round. I must get to the\r\n           village before the shop shuts...\r\n           She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an\r\n           afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.\r\n           COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.\r\n           We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly\r\n           his need to get away.\r\n           He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of\r\n           the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,\r\n           the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for\r\n           the road ahead.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 3.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5 EXT.

He gazes drily at Colin.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           There are no jobs.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'll come back tomorrow morning.\r\n           Just in case.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           It's a free country.\r\n           He sounds as though he rather regrets it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          11A EXT. 144 PICCADILLY.

(MONTAGE) 12\r\n\r\n           COLIN is back in his place at 8.30 sharp the next morning.\r\n           PERCEVAL gives him a grim stare as he goes through to his\r\n           office. VANESSA glances up from her typewriter. He meets her\r\n           eye optimistically but she ignores him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          13 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. RECEPTION AREA.

He grins back, sensing an opportunity.\r\n\r\n                          VANESSA\r\n           You can start by making me a cup of\r\n           tea.

RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 15\r\n\r\n           Close on the clock as it ticks around monotonously to\r\n           12.30. VANESSA puts on her gloves and collects her bag.\r\n           She gives COLIN a sly look.\r\n\r\n                          VANESSA\r\n           You can answer the telephone while\r\n           I'm at lunch, if you like.\r\n           She winks.

But if you want me to\r\n           transfer every single one...\r\n           PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           Use your judgement.\r\n           He hesitates and looks back.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)\r\n           I need a number for Noel Coward.\r\n           It won't be in the book, so\r\n           you'll have to track him down.\r\n           COLIN realises this is a test. He thinks quickly.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 8A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          16 INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. HALL.

RECEPTION AREA. DAY. 19\r\n\r\n           A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.\r\n           Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The\r\n           seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his\r\n           campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything\r\n           changes.\r\n           He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR\r\n           LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on\r\n           his arm.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his\r\n          fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is\r\n          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star\r\n          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.\r\n          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they\r\n          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them\r\n          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone\r\n          who comes into contact with them.\r\n          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet\r\n          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable\r\n          bluster and bonhomie.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply\r\n           impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on\r\n           the telephone? The darling girl\r\n           spends the entire day asleep. But\r\n           great beauty has its way...\r\n          He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic\r\n          response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices\r\n          COLIN hovering by the sofa.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           Hello, boy... remind me?\r\n          He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           You remember Colin, darling. You\r\n           met him at the Clarks' party.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n\r\n                          (NO IDEA)\r\n           Of course. What are you doing\r\n           here?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           You said there might be a job on\r\n           your film.\r\n          OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his\r\n          pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of\r\n          cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.\r\n          He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 11.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           There won't be any film unless\r\n           Miss Monroe gets her splendid\r\n           posterior out of bed.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           The House Committee are\r\n           threatening to withhold Miller's\r\n           passport. They say he's a\r\n           communist. No Arthur, no Marilyn.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           I'll have a word with the\r\n           American ambassador. I'm taking\r\n           him to see Vivien in South Sea\r\n           Bubble on Thursday... now, tell\r\n           me, Hughie, are Terry's rewrites\r\n           in?\r\n          He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they\r\n          disappear together into Perceval's office.\r\n          VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks\r\n          dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees\r\n          they are called \"Oliviers\". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in\r\n          amusement.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           They named them after Larry. The\r\n           first actor since Du Maurier to\r\n           have his own brand and they pay\r\n           him an absolute fortune. (Pause)\r\n           I'm afraid they're rather\r\n           ghastly.\r\n          She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in\r\n          mock awe.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           Isn't he gorgeous, Vanessa?\r\n\r\n                          VANESSA\r\n           I suppose he's all right.\r\n          VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a\r\n          handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,\r\n          getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of\r\n          Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n\r\n                          (TO COLIN)\r\n           Let's elope together and have the\r\n           most glorious affair. (Arch) Oh,\r\n           but then, who'd look after my\r\n           poor Larry?\r\n           Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.\r\n           VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           Now, darling, you must do\r\n           something for Colin. You\r\n           absolutely promised.\r\n           OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back\r\n           at PERCEVAL as he comes in.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Let's try to find him something\r\n           to do, Hughie.\r\n           COLIN grins in triumph. VIVIEN smiles at him.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           You will take care of my precious\r\n           Larrykins, won't you?\r\n           She flirtatiously offers up her cheek for COLIN to kiss.\r\n           COLIN's smile falters as he sees PERCEVAL looking at him\r\n           grimly.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20 INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY. 20\r\n\r\n           COLIN stands eagerly at PERCEVAL's desk. PERCEVAL looks at\r\n           him, more than usually brusque.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           Arthur Jacobs, Miss Monroe's\r\n           publicist is flying in tomorrow.\r\n           He wants to see the house she'll\r\n           be staying in. Find something\r\n           suitable.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          20 ALT INT. 144 PICCADILLY. HUGH PERCEVAL'S OFFICE. DAY. ALT\r\n\r\n\r\n                          20\r\n           COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a\r\n           tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed\r\n           and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-\r\n           up screen in the corner of the room.\r\n           Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the\r\n           film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice\r\n           of Colin.\r\n           He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,\r\n           hair and wardrobe tests for the film. MARILYN MONROE in\r\n           character as Elsie Marina.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 12A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting\r\n           silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in\r\n           costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she\r\n           wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking\r\n           wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.\r\n           It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,\r\n           fascinated, completely forgetting why he's there, still\r\n           holding the tray -\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n\r\n                          (TO CARDIFF)\r\n           Larry says he particularly likes\r\n           this dress. She looks radiant.\r\n\r\n                          CARDIFF\r\n           Exactly - we need to tone her down\r\n           a bit.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           How the hell do you tone down\r\n           Marilyn Monroe?!\r\n           COLIN laughs. He immediately regrets it. Both men turn to\r\n           look at him. PERCEVAL turns off the projector and gazes at\r\n           him stonily.\r\n\r\n                          PERCEVAL\r\n           Marilyn Monroe's publicist is\r\n           flying in tomorrow.

He taps his pencil thoughtfully\r\n           as he lights a cigarette - one of the branded pack that\r\n           Olivier gave him. He inhales deeply, thinking, then\r\n           grimaces in distaste, quickly stubbing it out under his\r\n           foot.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 13.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          22 EXT.

It is a rough, local place utterly devoid\r\n           of glamour or comfort.

The wallpaper is faded yellow\r\n           with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display\r\n           case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the\r\n           landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Colin Clark.

Pity, you\r\n           just missed them.\r\n          There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.\r\n          COLIN takes it on the chin.

The wallpaper is peeling, the\r\n           furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.\r\n           Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag\r\n           on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He\r\n           looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot\r\n           under the bed.

They chat and smoke, their scripts in\r\n           their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first\r\n           amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.\r\n           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very\r\n           much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.\r\n           RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.\r\n\r\n                          WATTIS\r\n           What a wonderful adventure, Dame\r\n           Sybil.\r\n\r\n                          SYBIL THORNDIKE\r\n           Such a lark!

I wish we could\r\n           all bring a friend. One does get so\r\n           terribly nervous. It's just like\r\n           the first day at school, isn't it?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 30.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           She smiles kindly at MARILYN who smiles back tentatively from\r\n           behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as\r\n           he makes his opening speech of welcome.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Welcome dear Marilyn, to our\r\n           little fraternity. (Pause, looks\r\n           around) We may seem a little\r\n           strange and quaint to you at\r\n           first, but I hope that in time\r\n           you may come to find your method\r\n           in our madness.\r\n           Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he\r\n           gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely\r\n           sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN\r\n           also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned\r\n           but clumsy joke.\r\n           Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a\r\n           sentimental flourish.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           So. My very noble and approv'd\r\n           good masters, let us now embark\r\n           on our great voyage of discovery\r\n           together. (Pause) With boldness\r\n           and (we pray) good fortune, may\r\n           we strive to create a work of art\r\n           that, led by your good graces,\r\n           will be cherished as long as\r\n           motion pictures may be\r\n           remembered.\r\n           He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes\r\n           discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.\r\n           There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of\r\n           eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the\r\n           reading.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50 INT.

OLIVIER is in full flow,\r\n           employing a heavy Mittel European accent.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 31.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)\r\n           \"Were you surprised to get my\r\n           invitation?\"\r\n          MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly.\r\n\r\n           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)\r\n           \"I'll say I was surprised.

CAFE DE PARIS. LONDON. NIGHT. 64\r\n\r\n           The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.\r\n           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few\r\n           young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an\r\n           exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and\r\n           the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among\r\n           them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them\r\n           both a glass.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Are you sure you can afford all\r\n           this?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Oh, it's all right.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           It must be costing a week's wages.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           It's worth it.\r\n           LUCY can't help being charmed.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           You're not the average third, are\r\n           you?

You and\r\n           Vivien?\r\n           He smiles mysteriously and leans in to kiss her. She avoids\r\n           him coolly.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm not that easy.\r\n           The WAITER approaches with a bill on a silver salver and\r\n           offers him a pen.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 43A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          WAITER\r\n           You'll be signing on your father's\r\n           account, sir?\r\n          COLIN blushes violently.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Certainly not. I settle my own\r\n           bills.\r\n          The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves.

Lucy's house has a neat\r\n           patch of front lawn, a stolid family car in the drive and\r\n           net curtains in the windows.

NIGHT. 65A\r\n\r\n           COLIN and LUCY are kissing in the small \"best\" parlour at the\r\n           front of the house. It is spotlessly neat and clean.\r\n           COLIN touches Lucy's breasts and then opens the buttons of\r\n           her blouse. She puts her hand on his, stopping him.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 45.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Wait a while, crocodile.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I really do like you, Lucy.\r\n          She looks at him shrewdly.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Maybe.\r\n          She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY (CONT'D)\r\n           That's my dad.\r\n          She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies\r\n          herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.\r\n          ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.\r\n          He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at\r\n          his daughter.\r\n\r\n           MR.

He takes his cue\r\n          and stands up.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Yes, I should be off. Colin Clark.\r\n           Pleased to meet you, Mr. Armstrong.\r\n          He offers the surprised MR.

LUCY follows\r\n          him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Next Saturday?\r\n          She nods.

He is\r\n           uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his\r\n           parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he\r\n           and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car\r\n           with an uneasy sense of relief to be getting away.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          66 EXT.

DAY. 69\r\n\r\n           OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS\r\n           watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They\r\n           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the \" The Coconut\r\n           Girl\" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is\r\n           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is\r\n           an effective but theatrical performance.\r\n           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back\r\n           row watching her performance from the same scene. She\r\n           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,\r\n           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand\r\n           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming\r\n           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's\r\n           look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and\r\n           reassurance.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           That one's pretty damn good.

For all his greatness as an actor he will\r\n           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive\r\n           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his\r\n           heart.\r\n           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches\r\n           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn\r\n           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on\r\n           screen he begins to see things differently.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 49.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           He sneaks a look at her in real life. She is holding\r\n           MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one\r\n           disastrous take follows another.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          70 INT.

SHOPPERS wander past, taking little notice of\r\n           MARILYN who has her hair covered in a scarf and wears dark\r\n           glasses. MILLER walks at her side, holding her hand.

His face lights\r\n          up and he shouts -\r\n\r\n                          PASSER-BY\r\n           It's Marilyn Monroe!\r\n          MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is\r\n          surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A\r\n          feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come\r\n          running to look, pushing and shoving to see.\r\n          MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin\r\n          with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the\r\n          cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press\r\n          towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it\r\n          becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream\r\n          Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.\r\n          A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back\r\n          against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on\r\n          her face.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           My God, she'll be torn apart...\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           Get her out of here.\r\n          COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what\r\n          they can to keep the excited fans at bay.\r\n          They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open\r\n          and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is\r\n          pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around\r\n          her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the\r\n          front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive\r\n          in beside Marilyn.\r\n          People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in\r\n          violent hysteria.\r\n          MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 53.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Jeez, Marilyn, they really\r\n           fucking love you.\r\n           As COLIN looks in the rear-view mirror he sees MILLER shaking\r\n           his head in dazed horror as MARILYN slumps half-collapsed\r\n           into the seat beside him.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           Madness.

He sees - or imagines - a terrible sadness\r\n           before she quickly replaces her dark glasses.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77 INT.

Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming\r\n          gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar\r\n          put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to\r\n          allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN\r\n          looks up at her in anguish.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I can't do this.

They speak in low, urgent tones.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           It's nearly lunch time.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           She isn't feeling the part.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           It's a light comedy. How much\r\n           feeling can it possibly require?\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Give her a few minutes...\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           She can't hide in her bloody\r\n           dressing room all day.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Oh, yes she can.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 62.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           OLIVIER looks at him angrily. He is close to the end of his\r\n           tether.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n\r\n                          (TO COLIN)\r\n           Go and find out what the hell's\r\n           going on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. MARILYN'S DRESSING ROOM. 87\r\n\r\n\r\n           DAY.\r\n           COLIN knocks softly on the dressing room door. PAULA\r\n           appears, opening it no more than a crack. She looks out\r\n           suspiciously, sees it is Colin and turns back into the\r\n           room.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA\r\n           It's Colin.\r\n           COLIN waits a moment then PAULA opens the door wider.\r\n           PAULA (CONT'D) (cont'd)\r\n           Come in. Marilyn wants to see\r\n           you.\r\n           COLIN stares at her in surprise.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          88 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. MARILYN'S DRESSING ROOM. 88\r\n\r\n\r\n           DAY.\r\n           COLIN comes in. The dressing room is in semi-darkness.\r\n           PAULA settles down in the corner. MARILYN lies on a sofa,\r\n           wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are\r\n           scattered across the dresser at her elbow. There is a long\r\n           pause. She sighs softly.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           How old are you?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           24. (Pause) Nearly\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           You remind us of the young king in\r\n           the movie. Kind of honest and\r\n           innocent.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n\r\n                          (WOUNDED)\r\n           I'm not innocent.\r\n           She turns her head and her beautiful face comes fully into\r\n           the light.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           What's your job on this picture?\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 62A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm the third assistant director.\r\n           Just a gopher really. Go for\r\n           this, go for that...\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           You're Larry's assistant too.\r\n          He shrugs awkwardly.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           What were you doing in my house\r\n           last night? Did he send you?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           COLIN hesitates. It seems pointless to deny it.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           He was worried about you.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Are you spying on me?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           No! Of course not. Why would\r\n           anyone spy on you?\r\n           She sighs, and looks away.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Are you all right, Miss Monroe?\r\n           He waits hesitantly, but she seems to have drifted off. But\r\n           then, suddenly, she turns back to him, her eyes huge.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Colin? Whose side are you on?\r\n           COLIN stares at her. She looks utterly beautiful and\r\n           vulnerable in the shadowy light. There is only one answer\r\n           anyone could give.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Yours, Miss Monroe.\r\n           She rewards him with a brilliant smile, her whole face\r\n           lighting up.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Call me Marilyn.\r\n           He is suddenly overwhelmed by a rush of sympathy. She looks\r\n           so lost and vulnerable. Perhaps he means it. Perhaps he is\r\n           on her side now.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. DAY. 89\r\n\r\n           As COLIN walks down through the studio he meets RICHARD\r\n           WATTIS with PAUL HARDWICK, on their way to wardrobe. WATTIS\r\n           winks at him.\r\n\r\n                          WATTIS\r\n           Marilyn's got a new boyfriend.\r\n           Larry will get jealous.\r\n\r\n                          HARDWICK\r\n           You can say that again.\r\n           He gives a camp laugh. COLIN tries to shrug it off with a\r\n           lightness he doesn't feel.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Nothing happened.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 63A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          WATTIS\r\n           You were in there for ten minutes\r\n           at least. Plenty of time for a\r\n           kiss and a cuddle.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 64.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Paula was with us the whole time.\r\n\r\n                          WATTIS\r\n           The mind boggles, dear.\r\n           COLIN smiles but his expression freezes as he looks up to\r\n           see LUCY nearby. She has heard every word of the exchange.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 90\r\n\r\n           MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance\r\n           routine. Released from the need to remember any words she\r\n           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in\r\n           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,\r\n           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.\r\n           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina\r\n           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates\r\n           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and\r\n           MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the\r\n           actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the\r\n           doorway.\r\n           Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one\r\n           can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely\r\n           joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn\r\n           is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his\r\n           face as he watches.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. NIGHT. 91\r\n\r\n           The stage is empty except for OLIVIER and MILLER. They sit\r\n           in a pool of light in the cavernous room. COLIN pours\r\n           whisky for them and then steps back into the shadows. Both\r\n           men ignore him. He is too unimportant to worry about.\r\n           MILLER leans forward, holding his pipe but not smoking it.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           I dreamed last night I could hear\r\n           singing. And then I realised it\r\n           wasn't a dream. There was a male\r\n           voice choir serenading Marilyn\r\n           under our window. At two in the\r\n           morning. It's a circus. A freak\r\n           show.\r\n           OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm going back to New York for a\r\n           few days. I need to see my kids.\r\n           I need a break.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 65.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           That won't help Marilyn.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           (After a moment)\r\n           I can't help her. (Pause) You\r\n           know what she loves to do most?\r\n           Sleep. It's what she lives for.\r\n           Sleep is her demon.\r\n          He pauses for a second.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER (CONT'D)\r\n           I've disappointed her.\r\n          OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER (CONT'D)\r\n           She thought I could smash all her\r\n           insecurities with one magical\r\n           stroke. That I could make her a\r\n           new person.\r\n          He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER (CONT'D)\r\n           She wants me to protect her but I\r\n           can't. I can't even protect\r\n           myself. (Pause) She read some\r\n           notes I made. They were nothing.\r\n           Just a few ideas.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           About her?\r\n          He looks up and nods slowly.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           She took them the wrong way.\r\n          He leaves a long, uneasy pause.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           But you do love her? Your new\r\n           bride and all that?\r\n          MILLER plays with his whisky.\r\n\r\n                          MILLER\r\n           I can't work. I can't think.\r\n           (Pause) She's devouring me.\r\n          Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to\r\n          every word.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 66.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          92 EXT.

VIVIEN LEIGH sits in the back seat.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           Hello, Colin darling. You look\r\n           like Horatio defending the\r\n           bridge.

DAY. 93\r\n\r\n           VIVIEN is doing what amounts to a royal tour. She greets\r\n           everyone, from the lowest chippie to the Heads of\r\n           Department with the same flirtatious grace. OLIVIER walks\r\n           at her elbow. The crew crowd around her. She is easy and\r\n           relaxed, relishing every second of their attention.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           I hope Larry isn't making you all\r\n           work too hard. I know what a\r\n           dreadful slave driver he can be.\r\n           She sees ORTON and takes his hands.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           David, he would be lost without\r\n           you.\r\n\r\n                          ORTON\r\n           Just doing my job.\r\n           Tough as he is, he melts visibly. She moves on to JACK\r\n           CARDIFF, the lighting cameraman, looking at him in mock\r\n           misery.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           I'm getting old, Jack.

She has come straight from make-up and wears\r\n           only a towelling robe, slippers and curlers in her hair.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 67.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           Compared to VIVIEN she looks frumpish. VIVIEN glides\r\n           towards her, hands extended.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           Darling Marilyn!\r\n           She kisses her on both cheeks and holds her hands.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           Larry tells me you are quite,\r\n           quite superb. I'm wild with\r\n           jealousy.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Oh, but everyone says you were a\r\n           wonderful Elsie on stage.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN\r\n           But I'm too old to play her in\r\n           the film. Larry was quite brutal\r\n           about that. You see, the truth is\r\n           all that matters to him. That's\r\n           why we all admire him so very\r\n           much.\r\n           She glances at OLIVIER with a fluttering laugh. He smiles\r\n           back with a haunted look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           Now, I must let you work. I only\r\n           came to wish you good luck!\r\n           Goodbye, everyone!\r\n           The crew press around her. MARILYN watches, feeling more\r\n           than ever the odd one out. COLIN watches her from the edge\r\n           of the crowd. She cuts a lonely, vulnerable figure. He is\r\n           totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN\r\n           comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.\r\n           VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and\r\n           she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade\r\n           of a beautiful building is beginning to crack. She gazes at\r\n           him with bitter disappointment.\r\n\r\n                          VIVIEN (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh, Colin.

The\r\n           screen is lit up with the rushes of the scene in The Prince\r\n           And The Showgirl where a startlingly beautiful MARILYN, in\r\n           gorgeous close-up, eats caviar and drinks champagne in a\r\n           toast to the American President.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 68.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector\r\n          beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth\r\n          holding a pile of film cans.

COLIN is\r\n           nervous and not quite sure what to do with himself. He\r\n           looks at the drinks in their decanters on the sideboard and\r\n           is suddenly desperate for some Dutch courage. He finds the\r\n           brandy and picks it up -\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n\r\n                          (OFF)\r\n           Help yourself to a drink.\r\n           COLIN wheels in surprise. MARILYN stands in the doorway,\r\n           casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a\r\n           pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I was just... checking you've got\r\n           everything you need.\r\n           She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away\r\n           from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his\r\n           gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks\r\n           up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the\r\n           decanter from his hand.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Here, let me.\r\n           She pours some brandy into a glass and gives it to him.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Are you frightened of me, Colin?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 72.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           No.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Good.

Will you\r\n           do that?\r\n          She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself\r\n          sinking into her gaze.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm only the third.

You\r\n           can see both sides of the\r\n           situation.\r\n          He shrugs in helpless agreement.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           I want you to be honest.

I'm starved.\r\n          He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his\r\n          silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh, gee, I'm sorry. Am I\r\n           interrupting something? Maybe you\r\n           have a Mrs. Colin waiting for you\r\n           at home?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           There's no Mrs. Colin.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           So we can talk as long as we\r\n           like?\r\n          He nods uncertainly.

It's\r\n           agony for him because he's a\r\n           great actor who wants to be a\r\n           film star, and agony for you\r\n           because you're a film star who\r\n           wants to be a great actress. And\r\n           this film won't help either of\r\n           you.\r\n          He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She\r\n          stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-\r\n          conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens\r\n          and coughs. She laughs.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Are you sure you can handle that?\r\n           You don't look old enough to\r\n           drink.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm 23, Miss Monroe.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           It's Marilyn.

MARILYN looks back\r\n           innocently and mouths the word \"packages\". She giggles. He\r\n           turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own\r\n           laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes\r\n           shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.\r\n           He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in\r\n           irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself\r\n           together.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Hello? Milton?\r\n           There is a long silence at the other end of the line.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          100 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS.

When he speaks again his anger is just\r\n           barely under control.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Let me speak to her, Colin.\r\n\r\n           CUT BACK TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          101 INT.

He turns back to the phone, barely able to get the\r\n           words out between snorts of laughter.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm sorry, Milton. I have to go.\r\n           He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN\r\n           smiles.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Let's walk in the garden. See if\r\n           we can find any more reporters in\r\n           the bushes.\r\n           She giggles.

DAY/DUSK. 104\r\n\r\n           There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.\r\n           MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the\r\n           path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical\r\n           closeness.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I didn't know it was so pretty\r\n           out here.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           You should get out more.

We're just like\r\n           Elsie and the young King. What\r\n           would Sir Laurence say if he\r\n           could see us now?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I don't think he'd mind.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a\r\n           friendly way as they walk.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I wanted to be an artist. To\r\n           grow as an actor. I was so proud\r\n           to be working with the great\r\n           Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks\r\n           I'm the enemy.\r\n           She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           He doesn't understand your kind\r\n           of actor. He's hated the method\r\n           ever since Vivien worked with\r\n           Elia Kazan. It's all too new and\r\n           strange. You're the future, and\r\n           it frightens him.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Every time I walk into the studio\r\n           I feel this sense of doom come\r\n           over me. He looks at me like\r\n           he's smelling a pile of rotten\r\n           fish. And the crew hate me.\r\n           Paula is the only person I can\r\n           trust. (Pause) Except for you\r\n           now, maybe.\r\n           She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses\r\n           swim as he stares into them...\r\n           ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.\r\n           It's Mr. Miller.\r\n           MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing\r\n           back briefly at Colin.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for\r\n           telling me the truth.\r\n           COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises\r\n           that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           You'll be leaving now, I expect.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105 INT.

COLIN walks in as OLIVIER is talking to\r\n\r\n           MILTON.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           I don't care if he fucks her\r\n           sideways. Perhaps it'll calm her\r\n           down. (Pause) Oh, hello, boy.\r\n          He smiles cheerfully.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 77.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           I hear you spent last night with\r\n           Marilyn.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I didn't spend the night with\r\n           her. We just had a chat.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           I heard them chuckling.\r\n          OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Perhaps if Colin is very\r\n           diplomatic Marilyn is more likely\r\n           to behave herself.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           She just wants a chum, that's\r\n           all.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           A chum? Jesus Christ, what is\r\n           this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,\r\n           kid.\r\n          He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.\r\n          OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror\r\n          and sighs abruptly.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           I thought working with Marilyn\r\n           would make me feel young again.\r\n           But I look dead in the rushes.\r\n           Dead behind the eyes.\r\n          He gazes at himself thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           Perhaps I'm angry with her\r\n           because in my heart I know my own\r\n           career is in a terrible rut. I\r\n           wanted to renew myself through\r\n           her but all I see reflected in\r\n           that magnificent face is my own\r\n           inadequacy.\r\n          He leans back.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           You know, I admire Marilyn.

DAY. 106\r\n\r\n           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at\r\n           the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is\r\n           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,\r\n           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.\r\n\r\n                          SOUNDMAN\r\n           What was Marilyn like then, Col?\r\n\r\n                          HARDWICK\r\n           Going over her lines with her,\r\n           were you?\r\n\r\n                          SOUNDMAN\r\n           Will she be in today or is she\r\n           too tired?\r\n           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely\r\n           protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           She was just being friendly.\r\n\r\n                          WATTIS\r\n           I'll bet.\r\n           There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner\r\n           only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.\r\n\r\n                          WATTIS (CONT'D)\r\n           Ever heard of the Venus Fly Trap?\r\n           There you are, Colin the innocent\r\n           little fly buzzing about happily,\r\n           when suddenly a heavenly scent\r\n           attracts you and - Snap!\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Oh, fuck off, Dickie.

COLIN looks on uneasily as\r\n           MARILYN, resting against her lean-to, has her costume\r\n           attended to by LUCY.\r\n\r\n                          ORTON\r\n           Three minutes, ladies and gents.\r\n           Three minutes.\r\n           It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date\r\n           with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently\r\n           behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an\r\n           angry MILTON.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Arthur Miller called me.

MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          108 EXT. STUDIO.

Marilyn\r\n           Monroe fancying you? Come on.\r\n           COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted\r\n           the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like\r\n           the idea being dismissed so lightly.\r\n           Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.\r\n           Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them\r\n           in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and\r\n           her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Hi, Colin.\r\n           COLIN smiles, self-conscious. MARILYN stops and frowns,\r\n           looking at Lucy.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Hey, are you guys dating? That's\r\n           what I heard.\r\n           She looks at him expectantly and suddenly his growing\r\n           fantasy that she might actually be interested in him kicks\r\n           in hard. He shrugs casually.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 81.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Of course not. You know how crews\r\n           like to gossip.\r\n           His voice trails off lamely as he realises he is repeating\r\n           what he has just said to Lucy. MARILYN smiles.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Too bad. You look cute together.\r\n           She walks off with her retinue. There is a long pause.\r\n           COLIN looks up to see LUCY staring at him in dismay. There\r\n           are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           I thought you were different.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Lucy, I really like you.

Part of him knows he should go after her, but in\r\n           the end he just stays where he is. He can't help feeling an\r\n           unworthy sense of relief.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          110 INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. COLIN'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 110\r\n\r\n           COLIN crosses to the mean little bed on its iron frame and\r\n           collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats\r\n           up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands\r\n           then folds the pillow over his head in a desperate attempt to\r\n           block it out.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          111 EXT.

As he reaches the doors\r\n           to the editing suites a battered old Wolsey draws up beside\r\n           him. ROGER SMITH is at the wheel.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           Get in.\r\n           COLIN looks at him in confusion. The studio doors open and\r\n           MILTON emerges. He glances darkly at COLIN and ROGER.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           Any problem, Roger?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 82.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           Just dropped by to take Colin out\r\n           to lunch.\r\n          COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his\r\n          cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           You're not taking him to Marilyn?\r\n           That would drop us all in a whole\r\n           ocean of shit.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           Oh, no, sir.\r\n          MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           What do you have in there?\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           Just a picnic. We've been looking\r\n           forward to it, haven't we, Colin?\r\n          COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly.

MARILYN screams and buries\r\n           herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over\r\n           into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and\r\n           the car roars off.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                          (SHOUTS)\r\n           Colin!

MARILYN\r\n           emerges from under the blanket, tousled and laughing.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Do you think he saw me?\r\n           COLIN can't help laughing. He finally tumbles into the back\r\n           seat with MARILYN as the car speeds away.

The wind sighs and the grass\r\n           is pleasantly warm underfoot. MARILYN turns her face up to\r\n           the sun.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           This is how I ought to feel every\r\n           day.\r\n           COLIN smiles.

Every surface is\r\n           covered with important documents - the place is a shrine to\r\n           antique learning and culture. SIR OWEN MORSHEAD (63), the\r\n           Queen's librarian, is a pleasantly eccentric figure with a\r\n           sly wit.

COLIN looks nervously at MARILYN but she\r\n           smiles and winks at him, mocking herself gently.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Shall I be \"her\"?\r\n           She jumps up onto a step and strikes a pose - hip out,\r\n           shoulders back, bosom thrust forward, the classic Marilyn\r\n           \"look\". The delighted crowd bursts into cheers. COLIN\r\n           stands proudly nearby, content to watch Marilyn being a\r\n           star, basking in the certain knowledge that she will be\r\n           leaving with him.

He\r\n          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only\r\n          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes\r\n          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than\r\n          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her\r\n\r\n                         CLOSER -\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Don't spoil it.\r\n          She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           I want this to be the perfect\r\n           date.\r\n          He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,\r\n          her expression wistful.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           I haven't had a real date since I\r\n           was 13 years old.\r\n          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo\r\n          of a lost childhood.\r\n          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.\r\n          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans\r\n          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as\r\n          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.\r\n          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching\r\n          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine\r\n          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him\r\n          with a radiant smile.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           That was nice.

COLIN hurls himself off\r\n           the bed.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 99.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I came in through the window...\r\n          He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Milton thought you were sick.\r\n          She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed\r\n          smile.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           The window? Is there a balcony,\r\n           like in Romeo And Juliet? How\r\n           romantic. (Pause) But I'm not\r\n           sick. What makes them think that?\r\n          She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her\r\n          bedside table.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Please don't take any more pills.\r\n          She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He\r\n          reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts\r\n          it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph.\r\n           COLIN (CONT'D) (cont'd)\r\n           Who's that?\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           My mom.\r\n          Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           They took her to the Sanatorium\r\n           when I was a kid. I grew up in\r\n           other people's homes, mostly.\r\n          Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture,\r\n          this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Abraham Lincoln?\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I don't know who my father is so\r\n           it might as well be him. Why not?\r\n           I can pick any father I want.\r\n          She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Do you have a home, Colin? A real\r\n           one?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Yes, I do.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 100.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           And a mother and father who still\r\n           live together?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Yes.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           And do they love you?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm sure they do.\r\n          He nods. She smiles sadly.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           You're lucky.\r\n          Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Do you love me, Colin?\r\n          He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately\r\n          vulnerable.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Yes.\r\n          She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her\r\n          palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them\r\n          away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back\r\n          gently on the pillow.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           But you and I come from different\r\n           worlds. You're like some Greek\r\n           Goddess to me...\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I'm not Greek.\r\n          She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his\r\n          hand, looking at him in appeal.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           I don't want to be a Goddess. I\r\n           just want to be loved like an\r\n           ordinary girl.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Mr. Miller loves you.\r\n          She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I found his notebook. It said I'd\r\n           let him down.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Writers scribble all kinds of\r\n           things. It doesn't mean anything.\r\n          She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           He wanted me to find it. It said\r\n           he should never have married me.\r\n           That I was unpredictable and a\r\n           woman-child, flighty and self-\r\n           centred. He's left me, Colin. Why\r\n           do the people I love always leave\r\n           me?\r\n          She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN\r\n          responds with sudden passion.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'll never leave you.\r\n          She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           All people ever see is Marilyn\r\n           Monroe. As soon as they realise\r\n           I'm not her, they run.\r\n          He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.\r\n          She sighs sleepily.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           Boy, there's a lot of men in this\r\n           business. And they all think\r\n           you've got to sleep with them.\r\n          She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           You're not like that. That's why\r\n           I like you.\r\n          COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           You should date that Wardrobe\r\n           lady. She's pretty.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I don't want to. (Pause) I love\r\n           you, Marilyn.\r\n          She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They\r\n          stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched\r\n          with both sensuality and a longing for something less\r\n          tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The\r\n          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.\r\n          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.\r\n          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for\r\n          weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it\r\n          does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away\r\n          from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           What's the matter? Don't you want\r\n           to make love?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Maybe we should just be friends.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Okay. Friends.\r\n          She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies\r\n          cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she\r\n          buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against\r\n          his back. She curls against him.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           This is nice. Like spoons. I used\r\n           to do this with Johnny.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Who's Johnny?\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Johnny Hyde. My agent, back in\r\n           the old days. He was thin, like\r\n           you...\r\n          Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body\r\n          warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is\r\n          clear eyed now and determined.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Marilyn?\r\n          She mutters softly in reply.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           Do one thing for me? Come into\r\n           the studio on time tomorrow and\r\n           show everybody what you can do.\r\n           Show Larry you're a great\r\n           actress.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n\r\n                          (BLURRED)\r\n           Okay.\r\n          He smiles and turns out the light.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 103.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          135 INT. PARKSIDE. MARILYN'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM. DAY. 135\r\n\r\n           First light streams in through the curtains. COLIN wakes to\r\n           hear Marilyn singing cheerfully. He gets up and sees her\r\n           through the open door of the bathroom sitting in the bath,\r\n           her back towards him. She is practicing the gentle waltz\r\n           tune she is to sing in the film.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           \"I found a dream and lay in your\r\n           arms the whole night through...\r\n           I'm yours no matter what others\r\n           may say or do...\r\n           She has never sounded so happy or carefree. COLIN smiles.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          136 EXT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. GATE.

(Pause) Christ, you\r\n           look rough.\r\n           He looks at him thoughtfully, then shrugs.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           Let me know when Marilyn arrives.\r\n           If she ever does.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Oh, I'm pretty sure she'll be in\r\n           this morning.\r\n           OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          137 INT.

DAY. 137\r\n\r\n           MARILYN, OLIVIER and WATTIS act a scene together; a drunken\r\n           Elsie Marina is being seduced by the Grand Duke, and\r\n           Northbrook bursts in to interrupt them as a VALET plays the\r\n           violin in the doorway behind him.\r\n\r\n           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)\r\n           \"Your Grand Ducal Highness..\"\r\n\r\n           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)\r\n           \"This is intolerable\"!\r\n\r\n           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)\r\n           \"With the deepest respect, sir,\r\n           my message was so important I had\r\n           no choice but to intrude\".\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 104.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           OLIVIER (AS REGENT)\r\n           \"Revolution?\"\r\n\r\n           WATTIS (AS NORTHBROOK)\r\n           \"No, sir, Miss Marina's aunt has\r\n           been in a motor accident.

PAULA appears.\r\n           She looks at him for a long, unnerving moment then speaks\r\n           with sudden ferocity.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA\r\n           From the first moment all I have\r\n           felt is Olivier's loathing and\r\n           contempt. He thinks I'm\r\n           unnecessary. Me, her drama coach,\r\n           surrogate mother, nursemaid. On\r\n           call 24 hours a day to help her\r\n           act, dole out pills, bolster her\r\n           ego, keep her sober enough to work.\r\n           (Pause) Me. Unnecessary. (Pause) No\r\n           me, no Marilyn.\r\n           He is taken aback by her passion. She smiles bitterly then\r\n           walks on. COLIN hesitates.

MARILYN looks at him dully, her\r\n           eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands\r\n           on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his\r\n           hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           You think I can act, don't you,\r\n           Colin?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Of course I do. You were\r\n           wonderful today.\r\n           PAULA looks at MILTON, then moves between them busily.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA\r\n           Marilyn's tired now.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I want him to stay with me.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           What would Arthur say if he knew\r\n           Colin was here?\r\n           A flicker of terror crosses MARILYN's face. COLIN turns on\r\n           them angrily.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           You heard what she said. She\r\n           wants me here.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 106.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the\r\n          field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the\r\n          bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA\r\n           You have no idea of your position\r\n           in the world, Marilyn. You are the\r\n           greatest actress there's ever been.\r\n           Not just actress. The greatest\r\n           woman of this or any time. I love\r\n           you like a daughter.\r\n          COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA (CONT'D)\r\n           It's hard now, but believe me you\r\n           will survive this and go on to\r\n           better things. Your life is ahead\r\n           of you. You're young, just\r\n           beginning.\r\n          Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN\r\n          watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA\r\n          gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.\r\n          Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.\r\n          As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I'm so tired of feeling scared.\r\n           Life is so shitty. I hate it. It\r\n           hurts too much.\r\n          COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I'm here now. I'll look after\r\n           you.\r\n          She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Good old Colin. Looking after me,\r\n           looking after Larry, looking after\r\n           Vivien. Always putting everyone\r\n           before yourself.\r\n          There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she\r\n          smiles and touches his face gently.\r\n          He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 107.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          141 INT.

It hurts, Colin!\r\n           She is doubled up, clutching her stomach, sweating and\r\n           frightened.

There is a shuffling sound and the\r\n           door is unlocked. At the same moment PAULA comes rushing\r\n           in, hair awry, gown flapping, a wild look in her eye.\r\n\r\n                          PAULA\r\n           Marilyn!

It's a castle, like in a\r\n           fairy tale. We wouldn't even have\r\n           to live together. You could have\r\n           your own suite of rooms...\r\n          He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She\r\n          looks at him with a sad, sweet smile.

He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain\r\n          that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't\r\n          want to be rescued.\r\n          He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Of course you're happy.

There is a\r\n           flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one\r\n           side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn\r\n           should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her\r\n           platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.\r\n           She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.\r\n           He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111-\r\n\r\n           112A.\r\n          MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She\r\n          smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort\r\n          or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or\r\n          sullen hostility.

I have\r\n           been ill.\r\n          She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to\r\n          understand herself and their expectations of her.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           I'd like you to remember I tried.\r\n          This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.\r\n          No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.\r\n          Perhaps they think it is just another performance.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          147A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 147A\r\n\r\n           OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on\r\n           top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after\r\n           his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible\r\n           as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.\r\n\r\n           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)\r\n           \"..I found a dream and lay in your\r\n           arms the whole night through, I'm\r\n           yours no matter what others may say\r\n           or do. Be light of heart and fancy\r\n           free, that's the way to start,\r\n           there will be nothing to lose till\r\n           you lose your heart..\"\r\n           She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There\r\n           is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is\r\n           amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy\r\n           for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept\r\n           up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her\r\n           she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring\r\n           softly so that only he can hear.\r\n\r\n                          SYBIL THORNDIKE\r\n           First love is such sweet despair,\r\n           Colin.\r\n           She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a\r\n           long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into\r\n           the darkness at the back of the set.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          148 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 148\r\n\r\n           Inch by laborious inch The Sleeping Prince moves towards the\r\n           finish line. We see a montage of scenes being filmed -\r\n           - HARDWICK enters as Major Domo through the main door of the\r\n           oval room, carrying a silver tray bearing shaving\r\n           equipment...\r\n           - WATTIS and JEREMY SPENSER crossing the drawing room to the\r\n           Grand Duke's bedroom...\r\n           - WATTIS crosses the drawing room and knocks on a door...\r\n           The process is hardly any easier but somehow the work is\r\n           done, until we come to the final shot in the sequence -\r\n\r\n                          ORTON\r\n           Very quiet, studio! Going for a\r\n           take.\r\n           The big overhead lights switch on with a series of heavy\r\n           clunks.\r\n\r\n                          DENYS\r\n           Camera running!

He\r\n           grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles\r\n           indulgently.\r\n\r\n                          ORTON\r\n           Cut! Okay boys and girls, that's a\r\n           wrap!\r\n           There is a smattering of applause from the crew. MARILYN\r\n           leaves the stage.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          148A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. CORRIDOR. DAY. 148A\r\n\r\n           MARILYN walks away from us, down the long corridor, alone.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          149 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 149\r\n\r\n           The crew shake hands and clap each other on the back like a\r\n           group of hardened war veterans. ORTON offers COLIN a\r\n           grudging nod - `well done'. MILTON now comes forward,\r\n           calling out above the hubbub.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON\r\n           If you'd all like to step this way,\r\n           you'll find something I think\r\n           you'll like.\r\n           MILTON indicates a trestle table at one end of the studio,\r\n           loaded with gaily wrapped parcels. He ushers the crew over.\r\n\r\n                          MILTON (CONT'D)\r\n           A parting gift to each of you from\r\n           Marilyn. Men on the left, ladies on\r\n           the right.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113B.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd\r\n          happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without\r\n          looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against\r\n          the wall.\r\n          There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.\r\n          Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps\r\n          their present. The bin is soon overflowing.\r\n          MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.\r\n          ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile\r\n          undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.\r\n\r\n                          JACOBS\r\n           It's been a lot of fun, kids. See\r\n           you at the Academy Awards.\r\n          He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the\r\n          dustbin as he goes.\r\n          COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the\r\n          label on his own small parcel, which reads simply \"To Colin,\r\n          with thanks, Marilyn\".\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 114.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         150 OMITTED 150\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          150A INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. WARDROBE DEPT. DAY. 150A\r\n\r\n           The wardrobe department is empty except for LUCY, who\r\n           cradles her own gift from Marilyn. COLIN comes in, looking\r\n           nervous. They look at each other awkwardly.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Aren't you going to throw yours\r\n           away?\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Of course not. It's from Marilyn\r\n           Monroe.\r\n           He smiles. She shrugs and turns to leave.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 115.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           (After a second)\r\n           Lucy?\r\n           She turns back to look at him.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN (CONT'D)\r\n           I was wondering if you're doing\r\n           anything this Saturday.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           I'm washing my hair.\r\n           He nods, accepting this as no more than he deserves. She\r\n           goes but then stops to look back at him.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY (CONT'D)\r\n           Did she break your heart?\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           (After a second)\r\n           A little.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY\r\n           Good. It needed breaking.\r\n           There is no malice in her response, just an awareness that\r\n           he is older and wiser now, and perhaps a better man for the\r\n           experience. He nods, accepting the rebuke.\r\n\r\n                          LUCY (CONT'D)\r\n           (After a second)\r\n           I might be free on Wednesday.\r\n           COLIN smiles. She goes out. He looks down at Marilyn's\r\n           present in his hands.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          151 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. HALL. DAY. 151\r\n\r\n           COLIN walks down the hall. He notices the red light is on\r\n           outside the viewing theatre. As he goes towards it he sees\r\n           ROGER coming the other way on his way out of the studio, his\r\n           job done. The two men smile; an acknowledgment of everything\r\n           they've been through together. ROGER offers him a friendly\r\n           salute and then goes on his way.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          152 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. VIEWING THEATRE. DAY. 152\r\n\r\n           OLIVIER sits on his own, watching an edited version of the\r\n           \"The Coconut Girl\" sequence (Scenes 61 and 62). COLIN comes\r\n           in. OLIVIER glances at him.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           \"You do look, my son, in a moved\r\n           sort/As if you were dismay'd: be\r\n           cheerful, sir./Our revels now are\r\n           ended.\r\n\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           These our actors,/As I foretold\r\n           you, were all spirits and/Are\r\n           melted into air, into thin air...\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Prospero.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n\r\n                          (SMILES)\r\n           We are such stuff/As dreams are\r\n           made on, and our little life/Is\r\n           rounded with a sleep...\"\r\n          COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in\r\n          silence as another sequence is projected for them. The\r\n          sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and\r\n          caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before\r\n          collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,\r\n          what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous\r\n          beauty.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           (After a second)\r\n           She's quite wonderful. No\r\n           training, no craft, no guile,\r\n           just pure instinct. Astonishing.\r\n          He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in\r\n          surprise.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           You should tell her that.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n           Oh, I will. But she won't believe\r\n           me. That's probably what makes\r\n           her great. It's certainly what\r\n           makes her so profoundly unhappy.\r\n          He smiles wryly.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           I tried my best to change her,\r\n           but she remains brilliant despite\r\n           me. (Pause) Directing a movie has\r\n           to be just about the best job\r\n           ever invented, but Marilyn has\r\n           cured me of ever wanting to do it\r\n           again.\r\n          He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the\r\n          lights come up.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           And now I'm going back to the\r\n           theatre. John Osborne is writing\r\n           a piece for me.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           I thought you hated all that\r\n           Royal Court stuff.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER\r\n\r\n                          (SMILES)\r\n           Miller made me see things\r\n           differently. (Pause) You have to\r\n           find new worlds to conquer, if\r\n           you want to be the best. And\r\n           believe me, most of the time, I\r\n           really am the best.\r\n           He goes to the door and pauses.\r\n\r\n                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)\r\n           You've done a good job, boy.\r\n           (Pause) Welcome to the circus.\r\n           He goes out. COLIN looks back up at the projection box.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Run it again, please.\r\n           The lights go down. MARILYN's face appears on the screen,\r\n           laughing and happy. It is another sequence, the one where\r\n           Marilyn does her sweet, uninhibited little dance (Scene\r\n           90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.\r\n           HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the\r\n           darkness, then -\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          152A INT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY 152A\r\n\r\n           The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing\r\n           his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing\r\n           the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head\r\n           down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.\r\n           BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and\r\n           regulars at play.\r\n           And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and\r\n           freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up\r\n           as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.\r\n           COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to\r\n           his woe and his pint.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           Buy a girl a drink?\r\n           COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Can I get another one of those\r\n           please, Barry?\r\n           BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not\r\n           to stare.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           I didn't want to leave without\r\n           saying goodbye.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117A.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n           MARILYN hands COLIN a package.\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n           The first time you saw this, all I\r\n           had on was the radio.\r\n           Colin opens the package.

DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 152B\r\n\r\n           The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens\r\n           the car door for MARILYN.\r\n           MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles\r\n           and says lightly:\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           What's that for?\r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n           That's for being on my side; and\r\n           remember, when you see me wink,\r\n           that's for you.\r\n           ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.\r\n\r\n                          ROGER\r\n           (glancing at COLIN)\r\n           Looking a couple of inches taller\r\n           than when I first saw you.\r\n           ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well\r\n           done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he\r\n           watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.\r\n\r\n                          BARRY\r\n           Was that really Marilyn Monroe?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           No - just a good friend of mine.\r\n           BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring\r\n           at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it\r\n           drives into the English countryside.\r\n\r\n                          FADE TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          153 EXT. WARDOUR STREET. LONDON. DAY. 153\r\n\r\n           COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat\r\n           dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is\r\n           little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and\r\n           down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.\r\n           We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154\r\n\r\n           COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all\r\n           over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.\r\n           A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own\r\n           desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Any messages?\r\n           THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.\r\n\r\n                          SECRETARY\r\n           It's probably just someone having\r\n           a joke.\r\n           COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles\r\n           phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           (After a moment)\r\n           Did she say anything?\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 118.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          SECRETARY\r\n           She just asked you to call.\r\n           (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it?\r\n           COLIN stares down at the paper.\r\n\r\n                          COLIN\r\n           Probably.

COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of\r\n           paper.\r\n           The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.\r\n\r\n                          OPERATOR\r\n           Your call to Los Angeles.\r\n           We hear the crackle of the international line.

Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood\r\n           hills.\r\n           A white phone rings on the table.\r\n           It rings continuously, insistently.\r\n           It carries on ringing.\r\n           No one comes.\r\n           HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think\r\n           Marilyn might appear, but she never does.\r\n           It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As\r\n           the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet\r\n           echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.\r\n\r\n           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MARILYN\r\n\r\n                          (VO)\r\n           \"I found a dream and lay in your\r\n           arms the whole night through, I'm\r\n           yours no matter what others may\r\n           say or do.

COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157\r\n\r\n           COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn\r\n           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise\r\n           has been revisiting it in his memory.\r\n           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going\r\n           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle\r\n           in resignation.\r\n           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He\r\n           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they\r\n           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he\r\n           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.\r\n           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a\r\n           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends\r\n           to look.\r\n           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her\r\n           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from\r\n           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by\r\n           Olivier, or perhaps \"borrowed\" as a souvenir and long since\r\n           forgotten.\r\n           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,\r\n           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.\r\n           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to\r\n           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks\r\n           happily.\r\n           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet\r\n           and charming.\r\n           There is something so completely natural about the gesture\r\n           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and\r\n           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It\r\n           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen\r\n           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for\r\n           years.\r\n           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,\r\n           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever\r\n           his.\r\n           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without\r\n           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then\r\n           looks back, smiling at the camera.\r\n\r\n          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Her face fills the screen.\r\n          Beautiful, timeless -\r\n          Happy.\r\n          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -\r\n\r\n           FADE TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n                          THE END\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nMy Week with Marilyn\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Adrian Hodges\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:55.762026"}
