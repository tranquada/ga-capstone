It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,\r\n           complete with turrets and even a moat.

He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a\r\n           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the\r\n           painting.\r\n\r\n<b>                          KENNETH\r\n</b>           ... and this is one of Carracci's\r\n           earlier works and one is able to\r\n           see the emergence of his now famous\r\n           Baroque style, which is clearly\r\n           rooted in the tradition of high\r\n           renaissance and antiquity...\r\n           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the\r\n           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The\r\n           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace.

He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is\r\n          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star\r\n          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.\r\n          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they\r\n          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them\r\n          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone\r\n          who comes into contact with them.\r\n          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet\r\n          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable\r\n          bluster and bonhomie.\r\n\r\n<b>                          OLIVIER\r\n</b>           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply\r\n           impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on\r\n           the telephone?

They\r\n           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the \" The Coconut\r\n           Girl\" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is\r\n           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is\r\n           an effective but theatrical performance.\r\n           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back\r\n           row watching her performance from the same scene. She\r\n           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,\r\n           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand\r\n           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming\r\n           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's\r\n           look stiff and clumsy.

For all his greatness as an actor he will\r\n           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive\r\n           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his\r\n           heart.\r\n           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches\r\n           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn\r\n           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on\r\n           screen he begins to see things differently.\r\n\r\n<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 49.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n           He sneaks a look at her in real life.

Released from the need to remember any words she\r\n           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in\r\n           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,\r\n           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.\r\n           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina\r\n           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates\r\n           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and\r\n           MARILYN captures all this perfectly.

Cheering BOYS hang out of every window.\r\n           MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into\r\n           the crowd to rescue her.

COLIN is much more self-\r\n           conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.\r\n           Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the\r\n           shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances\r\n           away, embarrassed.\r\n\r\n<b>           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 92.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Don't be shy, Colin.

He\r\n          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only\r\n          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes\r\n          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than\r\n          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her\r\n\r\n<b>                         CLOSER -\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          MARILYN\r\n</b>           Don't spoil it.\r\n          She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           I want this to be the perfect\r\n           date.\r\n          He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,\r\n          her expression wistful.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           I haven't had a real date since I\r\n           was 13 years old.\r\n          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo\r\n          of a lost childhood.\r\n          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.\r\n          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans\r\n          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as\r\n          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.\r\n          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching\r\n          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine\r\n          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him\r\n          with a radiant smile.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARILYN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           That was nice.

The\r\n          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.\r\n          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.\r\n          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.\r\n\r\n<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for\r\n          weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it\r\n          does for him it will only damage her further.

The sound of Marilyn\r\n           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise\r\n           has been revisiting it in his memory.\r\n           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going\r\n           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle\r\n           in resignation.\r\n           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He\r\n           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they\r\n           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he\r\n           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.\r\n           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a\r\n           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends\r\n           to look.\r\n           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her\r\n           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from\r\n           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by\r\n           Olivier, or perhaps \"borrowed\" as a souvenir and long since\r\n           forgotten.\r\n           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,\r\n           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.\r\n           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to\r\n           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks\r\n           happily.\r\n           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet\r\n           and charming.\r\n           There is something so completely natural about the gesture\r\n           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and\r\n           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It\r\n           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen\r\n           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for\r\n           years.\r\n           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,\r\n           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever\r\n           his.\r\n           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without\r\n           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then\r\n           looks back, smiling at the camera.\r\n\r\n<b>          MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Her face fills the screen.\r\n          Beautiful, timeless -\r\n          Happy.\r\n          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -\r\n\r\n<b>           FADE TO BLACK.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          THE END\r\n</b>\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/My-Week-with-Marilyn.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>My Week with Marilyn</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Adrian Hodges\" title=\"Scripts by Adrian Hodges\">Adrian Hodges</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/My Week with Marilyn Script.html#comments\" title=\"My Week with Marilyn comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:14.650344"}
