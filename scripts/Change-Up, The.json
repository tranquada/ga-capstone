SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          DAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles\r\n          through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a\r\n          grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY\r\n          GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles:\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Sorry Hank.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping\r\n          down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of\r\n          his squirming child...\r\n\r\n          INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder,\r\n          his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING\r\n          into each of his ears.\r\n          He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...\r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Juggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with\r\n          paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples,\r\n          filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns\r\n          kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Please, sweetheart, not my--\r\n          Honey, Daddy needs those--\r\n\r\n          INT. DEN -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming\r\n          twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into\r\n          their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp\r\n          away like perfect little angels.\r\n          Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control\r\n          and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing.\r\n          Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          ON SCREEN, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy\r\n          short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a\r\n          scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched\r\n          Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast...\r\n          Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change...\r\n\r\n          MAGNUM, P.I.\r\n          Is this the life you always dreamed\r\n          of?\r\n          Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes...\r\n          ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum...\r\n          Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a\r\n          tear falls from his eye. And then another.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Take me with you Magnum P.

So sorry.\r\n          Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway.\r\n          SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with\r\n          Dave, stymieing laughter.\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA MCARDLE\r\n          Really?

Then Dave crosses and pretends\r\n          to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Oh my goodness it is Lola my long\r\n          lost lover Lola who...I love.

MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright\r\n          overhead light. The white walls are empty.

Fuck you, Mitch.\r\n          Don't ever call me again.\r\n          She yanks on her coat and storms out. Dave stammers.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          It's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch\r\n          brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy. He\r\n          sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up.\r\n          Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor,\r\n          followed by her bra... Mitch exhales:\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Holy shit, I'm finally going to\r\n          fuck Jamie. This is my greatest\r\n          hour!

And starts taking a dump.\r\n          Mitch's face drops, horrified.\r\n\r\n                         JAMIE\r\n          I have to cool it on the Thai food.\r\n          I've had the shits all day.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n          Mitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the LOOSE\r\n          CONTENTS OF HER BOWELS empty into the toilet bowl.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Oh my GOD.\r\n\r\n                         JAMIE\r\n          Seriously -- light a candle.\r\n          She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous.\r\n          Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm\r\n          and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous...\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\n          Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling,\r\n          horrified.

Then he scoops\r\n          her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother.\r\n          Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Dude.

Dave's\r\n          confidence instantly crumbles...\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          I-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hit\r\n          on you. I'm just...I mean, I'm\r\n          married, so that's not even a\r\n          thing. W-W-Where are you from--?\r\n          Mitch appears and yanks him away. Dave looks traumatized:\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Was she reaching for her rape\r\n          whistle?\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Shake it off. Being single is like\r\n          the Tour De France: it's all about\r\n          quick recovery time. Now go on, get\r\n          your groove back, you're meeting\r\n          Sabrina in a half hour.\r\n\r\n                         QUICK CUTS:\r\n          Of Dave trying to chat up various YOUNG WOMEN at the carwash.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Your name is Dora?

Dave\r\n          slumps, shit. Mitch nods, looking at his watch.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times\r\n          are improving.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          I forgot how hard it is to be\r\n          single...\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          As a general rule, when you're\r\n          talking to single women,\r\n          conversation topics to avoid\r\n          include: your wife, your children,\r\n          your favorite playgrounds, and The\r\n          Wiggles...\r\n          Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          But this was good. You worked out\r\n          all your bad game and now you're\r\n          ready to dominate. Come on.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. FERRARI -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Mitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard. Dave looks nauseous.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          I don't feel good about this.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Relax: you're dressed cool, your\r\n          hair is crushing it, your ballsack\r\n          is taut and smooth, and you're way\r\n          better looking than you've ever\r\n          been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's\r\n          Golden Rule of Dating.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          I know, always use an alias.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          What? No. No, my Golden Rule of\r\n          Dating is always find the fun.\r\n          Think of it like this: for the next\r\n          two hours, you're stuck with this\r\n          chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool\r\n          or crazy or if she was born with a\r\n          vagina on her forehead -- you're\r\n          stuck, so make the most of it. I\r\n          dated this chick named Topaz once\r\n          who may or may not have killed her\r\n           father. Long story short, she\r\n          looked like 50 miles of bad road\r\n          and I wasn't interested, but I used\r\n          our time together to learn about\r\n          incest and the failures of the\r\n          American Appellate Court system. I\r\n          found it hugely informative, and\r\n          Topaz got caught up in my\r\n          enthusiasm and gave me a crying\r\n          blowjob on the car-ride home, so\r\n          everybody won. The point is: find\r\n          the fun for yourself and great\r\n          things will follow.\r\n          Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic\r\n          steakhouse.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Power hug.\r\n          Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave...\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Now go on. Make daddy proud.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          88.\r\n\r\n          INT. RICHTER'S RESTAURANT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER\r\n\r\n          Richter's is dark, elegant, romantic. Dave sits at a candle-\r\n          lit table, anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets.\r\n          Then Sabrina enters, looking stunning in a snug red dress,\r\n          and gazes around the restaurant. Dave's heart skips a beat,\r\n          and he waves her over. She approaches, smiling.\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          Hey!\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Hey. Hi. Hello.\r\n          He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a\r\n          handshake. It's awkward/cute.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Oh -- whoop -- okay.\r\n          They sit. Dave stares at her, terrified. Then he blurts out:\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Do you like Googoo Lady?!\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          What. . .what is that?\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          I-I don't know! I really don't!\r\n          Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter. Dave\r\n          winces, hating himself to the very core of his being...\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          So. How long have you known Dave?\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          M-My whole life, actually.\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          Annnd have you ever seen him act\r\n          like he did yesterday?\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          What, like a total douchebag?\r\n          She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't\r\n          himself right now. I hope he didn't\r\n          say anything to offend you...\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          No. I mean, he totally did, but\r\n          it's fine. I have brothers.\r\n          Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          So. You like working with Dave?\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          I love it. He's the best.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Isn't he just?\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          I.. .eh, nevermind.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          No, go on.\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          I actually used to sort of have a\r\n          crush on him, if you must know...\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          You did?

FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Foxtail is closed, but Dave, with Sabrina on his lap, sits in\r\n          a booth drinking champagne with DJ BASSNECTAR and all of his\r\n          ridiculously cool friends. Dave tells a joke and everyone\r\n          laughs -- including KIEFER SUTHERLAND, who's sitting next to\r\n          him; Kiefer slaps Dave five.

I'm not even sure he\r\n          understood the rules...\r\n          She laughs. Then they stop in front of her apartment. Beat.\r\n\r\n                         SABRINA\r\n          It's so weird, I feel like I've\r\n          known you for longer than just one\r\n          night...\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Yeah. Me too...\r\n          There's a lull for a kiss. Dave hesitates...so Sabrina moves\r\n          in and kisses him. It's sweet but passionate... When it's\r\n          over, Dave can barely speak:\r\n\r\n                         DAVE (CONT'D)\r\n          Can...Can, um, can I call you\r\n          sometime?

BATTING CAGES -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting\r\n          cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great...\r\n\r\n          EXT. JUNGLE -- MOVIE SET -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake\r\n          sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are\r\n          conveniently obscured by a giant fern.\r\n          Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW\r\n          applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful...\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY\r\n\r\n          Looking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee\r\n          shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a\r\n          pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Well, well, look who's all growns\r\n          up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n          Dave crashes on the couch, happy.

Open-toed sandals at work?\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Are...Are you kidding me?\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Look, I can't hang right now, okay?\r\n          I've got the mediation in like ten\r\n          minutes.\r\n          Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t\r\n          tell you that if you can get a\r\n          protracted buyout for anything over\r\n          700 million dollars, take it, okay?\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          700 million, you got it.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          (heading for the door)\r\n          Also, I wanted to thank you for\r\n          setting me up with Sabrina.

Dave: No. You can't, you\r\n          have to wait at least a week!\r\n          Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door.\r\n\r\n                         DAVE\r\n          Which reminds me, I wanted to call\r\n          to see if she got the flowers...\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          You sent her flowers after one\r\n          date?! Are you retarded?! Do not\r\n          get me into a relationship, dude!\r\n          Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then:\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          You can come out now, Gladys...\r\n          A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new\r\n          bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          94.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Look, honey, I don't think this is\r\n\r\n                         WORKING OUT--\r\n          Gladys YANKS him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed:\r\n\r\n                         GLADYS\r\n          I haven't had sex in 34 years! This\r\n          isn't over tit I su e' it's over.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          F-Fine, but can you please stop\r\n          following me to the bathroom and\r\n          calling my house late at night and\r\n          sending me all those filthy emails?\r\n          It's, you know, deeply disturbing.\r\n\r\n                         GLADYS\r\n          You need to realize something, boy:\r\n          (whispering in his ear)\r\n          I fucking own you now.\r\n          The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue\r\n          roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and\r\n          forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned.\r\n\r\n                         GLADYS (CONT'D)\r\n          I left you a little souvenir in\r\n          your pocket...\r\n          She winks and exits. Mitch tentatively reaches into his\r\n          pocket and pulls out a giant pair of TAN GRANNY PANTIES.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          I've created a monster...\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- DAY\r\n\r\n          A line of limousines roll up to Dave's building and dozens of\r\n          stone-faced EXECUTIVES from both companies file out...\r\n\r\n          INT. LAW FIRM -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY\r\n\r\n          KEN KINKABE and a slew of his EXECS sit on one side of the\r\n          massive conference table. Sitting across from them are CEO\r\n          TED NORTON, Mitch, Flemming Steel III, and a bevy of\r\n          Amalgamated execs. No one speaks. It's a corporate staredown.\r\n          Then the mediator, ERIN WALSH, 50's, enters, all business:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          95.\r\n\r\n                         ERIN WALSH\r\n          Thank you all for coming. My name\r\n          is Erin Walsh and I will be\r\n          mediating your claim today...\r\n          Mitch makes the \"I'm gonna slit your fucking throat\" gesture\r\n          to Ken Kinkabe, who recoils, what the...:\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. SIDE ROOM -- LATER\r\n\r\n          The mediation has broken into two separate rooms. The\r\n          Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense\r\n          silence. PAPERS litter the table. They've been here a while.\r\n          A large tray of sandwiches sits half-eaten on the sideboard.\r\n          Mitch jams the last piece of a ham sandwich into his mouth,\r\n          swallows it, and holds up his hands, victorious!\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          14! 14 sandwiches and 9 Diet\r\n          Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker!\r\n          An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air\r\n          and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him\r\n          like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.\r\n\r\n                         ERIN WALSH\r\n          Kinkabe agrees in principle to the\r\n          terms of the sale, and valuates\r\n          your company at 725 million\r\n          dollars. This is their last and\r\n          final offer. I'll be outside.\r\n          She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense.\r\n\r\n          FLEMMING STEEL III\r\n          It's a fair deal. I don't think\r\n          we'll get much more out of them...\r\n          The other execs all nod. Then Mitch BURRRRPS:\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Fuck that, dude, you can do better.\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          I beg your pardon?\r\n\r\n          FLEMMING STEEL III\r\n          Shut your mouth, Lockwood--!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          96.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Look, this is just like when you're\r\n          trying to fuck a Jewish girl and\r\n          she keeps saying \"no, no, I don't\r\n          want to, I'm really drunk and\r\n          you're not circumcised\" but then\r\n          she keeps making out with you and\r\n          not getting out of your Fiero so\r\n          you know she really does want it,\r\n          she just needs to be nudged a bit\r\n          more so she can rationalize it to\r\n          herself and to her God, know what I\r\n          mean? This is just like that.\r\n          Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Jesus I do not feel good.\r\n\r\n          FLEMMING STEEL III\r\n          How is this...at all... like that?\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          If this was really their final\r\n          offer, they'd leave. Instead,\r\n          they're sticking around, which\r\n          means they have more money to\r\n          spend.\r\n          Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          How much more do you think we can\r\n          get out of them? 10 million? 15?\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Fuck it, homey, go for 100.\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          What?!\r\n\r\n          FLEMMING STEEL III\r\n          Do not listen to him, Ted, he is\r\n          beyond reckless! If we make too\r\n          large a counter-offer, we risk\r\n          driving them away.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Enh, can't hurt to ask. You\r\n          wouldn't believe the nasty shit I\r\n          get girls to do just by asking.\r\n          Honestly, it's revolting.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          97.\r\n          Ted looks genuinely torn. He dabs his sweaty brow.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n          Seriously, does anyone have a\r\n          Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw.\r\n          Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100\r\n          million and that is our final\r\n          offer, because we're leaving.\r\n          (loudly, to his execs)\r\n          Fuel the jet. Let's go.\r\n          The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their\r\n          briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Nice, bro. Way to show some sack.\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          You had better be right, son, or\r\n          else I am most definitely fired.\r\n\r\n                         MITCH\r\n          Hey, me too. Bones.\r\n          He extends his fist. Ted ignores him and gathers his things.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES -- A SHORT WHILE LATER\r\n\r\n          Ted Norton and all his execs hurry out of the building,\r\n          briefcases in hand, looking ashen. They head for their long\r\n          line of idling limos. Ted hisses to Flemming:\r\n\r\n          CEO TED NORTON\r\n          I can't believe we just walked away\r\n          from 725 million dollars.\r\n\r\n          FLEMMING STEEL III\r\n          For the record, I did not support\r\n\r\n                         THAT DECISION--:\r\n\r\n          VOICE BEHIND THEM\r\n          Mr. Norton?!
