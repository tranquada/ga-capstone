Various CAR WASH\r\n          EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.\r\n\r\n<b>          CAR WASH EMPLOYEES\r\n</b>          Hola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?!\r\n\r\n<b>                         MITCH\r\n</b>          The bottom line is: the internet\r\n          has revolutionized everything.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DAVE\r\n</b>          You mean like J-date?\r\n\r\n<b>                         MITCH\r\n</b>          Fuck J-date. No. The internet has\r\n          changed chicks in three major ways:\r\n          first, access and acceptance of\r\n          pornography has commoditized women\r\n          and pressured them into becoming\r\n          sluttier at far younger ages, which\r\n          is awesome.\r\n          Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MITCH (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Second: text messaging has de-\r\n          stigmatized the booty call. Call a\r\n          girl at 3 in the morning for sex\r\n          and it's creepy. Text her \"SUCK\r\n          WANG MIDNIGHT??\" and it's classy.

I\r\n          dated this chick named Topaz once\r\n          who may or may not have killed her\r\n           father. Long story short, she\r\n          looked like 50 miles of bad road\r\n          and I wasn't interested, but I used\r\n          our time together to learn about\r\n          incest and the failures of the\r\n          American Appellate Court system. I\r\n          found it hugely informative, and\r\n          Topaz got caught up in my\r\n          enthusiasm and gave me a crying\r\n          blowjob on the car-ride home, so\r\n          everybody won.
