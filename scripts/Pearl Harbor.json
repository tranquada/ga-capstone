POV OF AN AIRPLANE\n\n\tFlying over American heartland.  We see the earth through the\n\tpilot's perspective as sky and ground swap positions, the\n\tplane swooping down and storming over the ground.\n\n\tTHE PLANE\n\n\tis a biplane, racing over a field lush with young plants.  It\n\treleases a trail of crop spray, and climbs again...\n\n\tUp into a crystalline blue sky where sunshine pours like\n\thoney over family farms stretching to the horizon.  Maybe\n\tit's not heaven, maybe it's just Tennessee.  But as long as\n\tthere's been an America, men have fought and died for this\n\tplace -- as volunteers.\n\n\tFar off, but visible from the plane is\n\n\tA BARN - DAY\n\n\tThe barn is unpainted except for hand lettering that says\n\t\"McCawley Crop Dusting.\" Another plane noise, this one made\n\tby kids, brings us to TWO BOYS, sitting in the shell of an\n\told plane propped on crates, scavenged of it's engine, seats,\n\tand wheels.\n\n\tThe boys sit in it's cockpit, butts crowded onto the nail keg\n\tthey've replaced the seat with.  They've even attached a 2x4\n\tas propeller, as if their imaginations needed any help.  They\n\twear overalls and have bowl haircuts:  RAFE and DANNY, 10\n\tyears old.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tBandits at 2 o'clock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tPower dive!\n\n\tThey buzz their lips in a flying noise and work the controls,\n\tRafe's bare feet on one pedal, Danny's on the other.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tIt's Germans!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tKill the bastards!\n\n\tRafe looks at Danny in shock -- then they both laugh and go\n\tright back into their game, manufacturing their own machine\n\tgun and engine sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tGood shooting, Danny!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tGood shooting, Rafe!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tLand of the free...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tHome of the brave!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThere's another one!\n\n\tTheir vocal motors roar again... But a man's hand grabs Danny\n\tby the straps of his overalls and jerks him from the cockpit.\n\n\tIt's Danny's FATHER and he's a fearsome sight; drunk, his\n\thair uncombed, his face unshaven, his teeth -- those still\n\tleft -- are rotting.  He's also missing an arm; but the one\n\tthat's left is potent, and he's shaking Danny with it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY'S FATHER\n\t\t\tYou no count boy!  Johnson come lookin',\n\t\t\tsaid he'd pay a dime for you to shovel\n\t\t\this pig shed, and I can't find you no\n\t\t\tplace.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tDaddy, I told you I was comin' here.\n\n\tHis father slaps him off his feet.  Rafe is so horrified he\n\tcan't get a sound out.  Danny isn't even surprised.  But when\n\this father snatches him up again, twisting the overall straps\n\tso tight they choke him, he struggles.  It does no good; his\n\tfather starts marching across the field, dragging and\n\tstrangling Danny.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tDa!... Dad...\n\n\tThe father's drunken anger makes him oblivious -- until\n\tCRACK!  The 2x4 propeller slams him across the back, knocking\n\thim to the ground and making him drop Danny.\n\n\tThe father rolls over to see 10-year-old Rafe, holding the\n\t2x4 like a bat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tLet him alone!\n\n\tThe father's eyes bulge in rage; he struggles to his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tRafe... Daddy... No!\n\n\tThe man looks murderous, but Rafe draws back the board.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI'll bust you open, you...German!\n\n\tThe words ring something deep in the man's booze-broken\n\tbrain.  He begins to cough, convulsively; it brings a blossom\n\tof blood to his mouth.  He wipes it with his hand, but blood\n\tclings to his teeth.  He chokes out --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY'S FATHER\n\t\t\tI fought the Germans.\n\n\tHe looks at Danny in shame, with the realization of what he's\n\tjust done.  He turns and staggers away.\n\n\tDanny looks at Rafe -- a communication between boys joined by\n\tsomething deeper than blood.  Then Danny runs off after his\n\tfather.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tDaddy!  Daddy!  Wait.\n\n\tDanny catches him, takes his father's hand, and walks away\n\twith him.\n\n\tThe crop duster we saw in the air has just landed, behind\n\tRafe.  The pilot, RAFE'S FATHER, shuts off the engine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE'S FATHER\n\t\t\tWhat's goin' on, son?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tNothing.  Danny's Dad just come to get\n\t\t\thim.\n\n\tRafe turns back to the ramshackle plane and replaces the 2x4\n\tpropeller.  His father looks toward Danny and his father,\n\twalking away, then looks at his own son.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE'S FATHER\n\t\t\tHey, boy -- you wanna go up?\n\n\tRafe can't believe it; he runs to the plane and hops into his\n\tfather's lap.  As his father cranks the engine and tucks him\n\tinto the harness, Rafe says --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDaddy, sometime will you take Danny up\n\t\t\ttoo?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE'S FATHER\n\t\t\tSure will, son.\n\n\tThe engine races to life...and we --\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT.  NEW JERSEY AIR BASE - DAY\n\n\tAmerican P-40 fighters blast through the air, props screaming\n\tand wind singing by their wings.\n\n\tThere are eight pilots in their individual seats, and we\n\tfocus on two:  RAFE MCCAWLEY has grown lean and handsome.\n\tAnd DANNY WALKER is very much the same.\n\n\tTheir planes start swapping positions in the formation; while\n\tthe other guys are flying along in a tight line, Rafe and\n\tDanny are playing, one of them gunning his engine to go high,\n\tthe other diving and coming back up in his place,\n\tleapfrogging.\n\n\tIt scares the other guys, having their planes flashing in and\n\tout, so close.  The TRAINING CAPTAIN, watching through\n\tbinoculars on the ground, talks into his RADIO --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tMcCawley!  Walker!  Cut that out!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI thought this was a training flight.\n\t\t\tI'm just trying to give Danny some\n\t\t\ttraining.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tNot on your best day, boy!\n\n\tRafe grins and guns his plane low, in the opposite direction\n\the was moving before.  Danny reacts almost instantly...\n\tleapfrogging in the opposite direction, scaring the piss out\n\tof everybody else.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tThat's it, get into a wedge!\n\n\tThe squadron responds, forming up into a tight V, Rafe and\n\tDanny just behind and on either side of the center.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDidn't you say test the limits?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tHey, you wanna test my limits, you better\n\t\t\tline up a couple dozen women on the\n\t\t\tGROUND...cause I got NO limits in the\n\t\t\tair!\n\n\tRafe grins, loving the challenge.  Then he and Danny do the\n\tleapfrogging maneuver laterally, swapping sides in the V.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tEverybody down!\n\n\tEXT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - DAY\n\n\tThe planes land in tight order and taxi off the runway; shut\n\tdown their props, slide back the canopies and hop down.  We\n\tsee young pilots we'll get to know:  ANTHONY, BILLY, RED.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tWhere are McCawley and Walker?\n\n\tEXT.  RAFE AND DANNY - STILL IN THE AIR - DAY\n\n\tThey've circled to opposite ends of the airfield and are now\n\theading right at each other, like two bullets playing\n\tchicken.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tAw shit...\n\n\tINT.  THE COCKPITS\n\n\tFrom Rafe and Danny's POV, the rush is awesome.\n\n\tTHE PILOTS ON THE GROUND watch in awe as the P-40's get so\n\tclose they can't possibly get out of each other's way.\n\tBilly, the most boyish-faced of the pilots, yells to drown\n\tout the sound of the collision...\n\n\tAt the last instant, both planes snap a quarter turn so that\n\ttheir wings are vertical, and they shoot past each other\n\tbelly to belly.\n\n\tIN THE COCKPITS\n\n\tRafe and Danny burst out laughing.\n\n\tTHE PILOTS ON THE GROUND\n\n\tlaugh and congratulate each other.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tYou know what they say... You can take the\n\t\t\tcrop duster out of the country -- but\n\t\t\tdon't put him in a P-40.\n\n\tRafe banks to land, and Danny tucks in behind him.  Danny has\n\tRafe's plane in his sights.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tIf I had guns I'd be chewing up your --\n\n\tRafe feints left, banks right, and appears behind Danny.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tIf you had guns, you'd be pissin' on 'em.\n\n\tThey're almost to the landing strip, Rafe behind Danny.  But\n\tas Danny's wheels are about to touch, he guns his engine and\n\tsnaps the nose of his plane straight up.\n\n\tTHE OTHER PILOTS stop laughing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\t\tHe's doing an inside loop!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tAw, shit...\n\n\tDanny pulls it off, just barely making a full circle to come\n\tin behind Rafe and bounce to a stop on the runway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tYee-hawww!!!\n\n\tDanny taxis his plane over to join the others.  He's grinning\n\tas he slides back his cockpit cover; then --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tWhere's Rafe?\n\n\tRed, tall with flaming orange hair, tips his chin toward the\n\tair.  Seeing Rafe's plane still in the air, Danny starts to\n\trefasten his harness.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tYou're down, Walker!  That's an order!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tWhat about him?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tHe's not taking my orders anymore.\n\n\tDanny's just about to ask what the hell that means, when he\n\tnotices Rafe climbing in a deliberate spiral.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tHe's gonna do it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\tDo what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tIt.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tAw, shit.  Aw shit shit shit...\n\n\tRAFE'S PLANE reaches two thousand feet, just a speck above\n\tthem, and seems to pause in the air.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tI shouldn't'a done an inside loop.\n\t\t\tI shouldn't'a done an inside loop.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tCause now he's gonna do an outside loop.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTRAINING CAPTAIN\n\t\t\tAw shit.  Aw shit shit shit...\n\n\tAnthony and Billy join in, like an involuntary chant --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANTHONY & BILLY\n\t\t\tAw shit shit shit...\n\n\tRAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT, is tightly controlled, yet serene.  He\n\tnoses the plane into a power dive.\n\n\tThe P-40 screams toward the ground, picking up speed, going\n\tso fast it begins to shudder.\n\n\tTHE OTHER PILOTS are transfixed.  Red is so nervous he can't\n\tget the words out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tAw sh- sh- sh- sh-\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\tShit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tYou can do it, Rafe.  You can do it.\n\n\tThe P-40, hurtling toward the ground at nauseating speed,\n\tsnaps into a half roll, streaking upside down over the\n\trunway.  Rafe hangs inverted in his flight harness, the\n\tasphalt of the runway shooting past, ten feet beyond his\n\thead.\n\n\tHe pushes the plane into a climb, his cockpit on the outside\n\tof the circle.  The plane reaches the top of its arc, and\n\talmost stalls; but Rafe noses it over again, toward the\n\tearth, only this time he has very little altitude.  The plane\n\thurtles down, still with it belly on the inside of the\n\tcurve...\n\n\tAnd makes it full circle.  Rafe's head now is barely a foot\n\toff the asphalt as the plane shoots past, still inverted.\n\n\tTHE OTHER PILOTS burst into cheers.\n\n\tRAFE, IN HIS COCKPIT permits himself a smile.\n\n\tHe lands, and the guys run out to meet him...all except for\n\tthe Training Captain, who stands there shaking his head.\n\n\tDanny jumps on the wing, as Rafe stops and slides back his\n\tcanopy.  Danny grabs him by the harness and shakes him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tYou could've killed yourself, you stupid\n\t\t\tbastard!\n\n\tHe dives into the cockpit, hugging Rafe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tThat was the most beautiful thing I ever\n\t\t\tsaw.\n\n\tINT.  COLONEL DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n\tCOLONEL JIMMY DOOLITTLE, mid-forties, is commander of the\n\tbase.  He's as tough as he is good in the air.  And right now\n\the's frowning at Rafe McCawley, standing at attention before\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOOLITTLE\n\t\t\tThere are some people who think the\n\t\t\toutside loop is reckless and\n\t\t\tirresponsible.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tHow could it be irresponsible, Sir, if\n\t\t\tyou were the first man in the world to do\n\t\t\tit?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOOLITTLE\n\t\t\tDon't get smart with me, son.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tNever, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous\n\t\t\tonly for the kind of pilot who wants to\n\t\t\tshow off, rather than inspire the other\n\t\t\tpilots in his unit.  And all you've done\n\t\t\tfor me, Sir, working out the transfer, I\n\t\t\tdid it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir.\n\t\t\tWhat the French call a \"homage.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOOLITTLE\n\t\t\tThat's bullshit, son.  But it's really\n\t\t\tgood bullshit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThank you, Sir.\n\n\tDoolittle stands, moves around his desk, and shakes Rafe's\n\thand.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOOLITTLE\n\t\t\tGood luck over there McCawley.  I admire\n\t\t\tyour decision.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThank you, Sir.\n\n\tINT.  NEW JERSEY AIRFIELD - BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n\tThe pilots are getting slicked up for a night on the town.\n\tDanny's at the mirrors with the others; he's putting on\n\tcologne, and looks terrific in his uniform.\n\n\tAnthony and Billy are combing their hair at the sinks.

NEW JERSEY BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n\tRafe and Danny are walking on the parade ground; the other\n\tguys are already on the bus that will take them into town.\n\tDanny's upset by what Rafe just told him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tHow could you do this?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThe Colonel helped me work it out.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tI don't mean how'd you do the paperwork,\n\t\t\tI mean how the hell did you do it without\n\t\t\tletting me in on it?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI'm sorry, Danny, but they're only\n\t\t\taccepting the best pilots.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tDon't make this a joke, Rafe.

At the door of the train, Evelyn\n\twhispers to Betty --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tStick with me, I'll find you somebody\n\t\t\tgood.\n\n\tBetty spot's Rafe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\tI'll take that one.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tHe's taken.  But come on, I'll introduce\n\t\t\tyou.\n\n\tThey move to Rafe; he crosses the platform to meet them, his\n\teyes holding Evelyn.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tHello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tYou too, Lieutenant.\n\n\tBetty clears her throat.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tOh, this is Betty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tNice to meet you, Betty.\n\n\tHe draws his hand from behind his back; he's holding two\n\troses.  He hands one to Evelyn and the second to Betty.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny would'a brought this.\n\n\tHe escorts them along the platform.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tDanny's not coming?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tNo, he...got some news today.

CITY NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tIt's a party in full swing; swing music, jitterbugging,\n\tbeautiful young men and women in high spirits.\n\n\tRafe and Evelyn are sitting at a big table with the other\n\tpilots and nurses.  Anthony's paired up with Sandra, Billy\n\twith Barbara, and Red, shyest of the group, finds himself\n\tnext to Betty.  Betty's already found a companion in Red\n\tStrange.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tHe, I'm R-Red.

Well the guys called me R-Red,\n\t\t\tcause you know, I'm red...and they\n\t\t\tthought I was strange, so, you know, Red\n\t\t\tG-Grange, Red Str-Strange.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\tBut...they called you Strange?  Because\n\t\t\tof Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red\n\t\t\tGrange strange?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tHow would I know.\n\n\tBeside her beer is an open ketchup bottle; he picks it up and\n\tswigs from that.  Rafe and Evelyn see this, and try to keep\n\tfrom laughing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\tDo you always stutter?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tOnly when I'm n-n-n-\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBETTY\n\t\t\tNervous?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tYeah.

Under the table,\n\tRafe and Evelyn join hands too.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tThere shipping us out.  Hawaii.  The\n\t\t\tGermans are overrunning Europe, and we're\n\t\t\tsent to paradise.  How about you?  Have\n\t\t\tyou heard anything?\n\n\tHe hesitates; then Evelyn is distracted by the conversation\n\tbeside them, between Barbara and Billy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\tYou're a very special woman, and...well\n\t\t\tbaby, they're training me for war, and we\n\t\t\tdon't know what happens tomorrow.  So we\n\t\t\tgotta make tonight special.\n\n\tBarbara shoots a look at Evelyn, before she answers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARBARA\n\t\t\tI hope you can back that up, flyboy.\n\t\t\tCause you're not ever gonna forget\n\t\t\ttonight.\n\n\tShe takes him by the hand and pulls him to his feet... They\n\tstart dancing, sexy movements that won't stop till they've\n\tbeen in bed.\n\n\tRafe pulls Evelyn to her feet, and leads her through the\n\tdancers, outside.\n\n\tEXT.  THE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tThey find a quiet place on a balcony that overlooks the\n\triver, and Manhattan beyond.  Evelyn takes in the view,\n\tbreathes in the air; she still holds the rose.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tWhatever you're trying to tell me isn't\n\t\t\tgood, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard\n\t\t\tto say.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThe only reason it's hard to say is that\n\t\t\tI keep thinking I don't have the right to\n\t\t\tsay it.  But I've got to because it's\n\t\t\ttrue.  I love you.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tThat must surprise you.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tIt surprises me that I'm not the only one\n\t\t\ton this balcony who feels that way.\n\n\tThe power of hearing this from each other grips them both.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThere's one thing I have to say.  I'm\n\t\t\tgoing away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tWe're all going away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI'm going to the war.  The real war.\n\t\t\tHitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are\n\t\t\thanging on by their fingernails, and If\n\t\t\tthey lose, there'll be more people killed\n\t\t\tthan anybody can imagine.  And not just\n\t\t\tthere, but here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tBut you're in the U.S. Army, how could\n\t\t\tyou --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tColonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and\n\t\t\tput me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need\n\t\t\tpilots, and we need experience.  I leave\n\t\t\ttomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tYou waited til tonight to tell me?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI had to tell you in person.  Because\n\t\t\tthere's something else I need to say.\n\n\tHe studies her face, burning it into his memory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tEvelyn...you know the line -- let's make\n\t\t\ttonight memorable.  What I feel about you\n\t\t\tmakes it impossible for me to say\n\t\t\tsomething like that.  If I don't come\n\t\t\tback, I don't want to saddle you with\n\t\t\tregret and sadness you'll carry the rest\n\t\t\tof your life.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tI don't know if you can choose that,\n\t\t\tRafe.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tMaybe not.  But I need you to know.  I\n\t\t\tlove you.  And I will come back.  I'll\n\t\t\tfind a way.  And then we'll get a chance\n\t\t\tto know if what I felt the first moment I\n\t\t\tsaw you, and every minute since then, is\n\t\t\treal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tDo one thing for me, before you go.\n\n\tShe takes his hand and leads him inside.\n\n\tINT.  NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tShe leads him onto the dance floor, and they dance, among the\n\tothers, yet in a world apart from everyone else.  And then\n\tthey stop while all the others move around them, and kiss the\n\tkind of kiss that lasts a lifetime.\n\n\tEXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT\n\n\tThe nurses are entering the hotel.  Pilots are going in with\n\tthem.  But Rafe and Evelyn stop on the street.\n\n\tA last kiss.  Their hands touch a final time, and then part.\n\tShe moves inside the lobby, and looks out the glass doors as\n\the walks away.\n\n\tEXT.

If I asked her to come and\n\t\t\tshe came, it wouldn't tell me anything.\n\t\t\tIf I tell her not to come, and she\n\t\t\tcomes...then I know she loves me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE\n\t\t\tALL ABOARD!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tYou're still a kid, ya know that?

Rafe waves.\n\tDanny waves back and smiles, but he whispers like a prayer...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tGive 'em hell, Rafe.\n\n\tINT.  TRAIN - DAWN\n\n\tRafe finds a seat and sits down.  He's the only one in the\n\tcar, and he's deeply alone.\n\n\tEXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAWN\n\n\tDanny walks to one of the three revolving doors back into the\n\tstation.  He takes the one on the far right.  As he passes\n\tthrough it, he doesn't see Evelyn rushing through the door on\n\tthe left side.  She's told herself she wouldn't come, but\n\tcouldn't help it, and now as she sees the last car of the\n\ttrain disappearing around the corner the pain of it all hits\n\ther.\n\n\tShe stands on the empty platform, as lonely as Rafe.\n\n\tMONTAGE - THE JOURNEYS\n\n\tRafe and Evelyn travel in opposite directions, toward\n\topposite ends of the earth...\n\n\tEXT.

NORTH ATLANTIC - DAY\n\n\tRafe's ship is in a convoy through the rough gray waters.\n\tThe deck is loaded with military supplies bound for Britain.\n\tRafe stands among the drab crates and seems oblivious to the\n\train, his thoughts on Evelyn.\n\n\tHe looks toward the eastern horizon, where his ship is\n\theading.  A deep, dark storm is brewing before them...\n\n\tEXT.  PACIFIC - DAY\n\n\tEvelyn stands on the deck of a ship headed in the opposite\n\tdirection, on another ocean, the sky is clear, the breeze is\n\twarm, the light of a glowing sunset bathes her face.  The\n\tMONTAGE ENDS, with them heading to different ends of the\n\tearth.\n\n\tEXT.  BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DUSK\n\n\tIn the eternal dusk of England, everything is cold and gray.\n\tBritish fighter planes -- Spitfires and Hurricanes -- are\n\tsurrounded by mechanics hurriedly ripping off bullet riddled\n\tfuselage panels and digging into overworked aircraft engines.\n\tRafe walks across the tarmac, still carrying his duffel bag.\n\tHe moves up behind a slim, pale BRITISH AIR COMMANDER who is\n\tsurveying engine damage on one of the Spitfires.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tRafe McCawley, Sir.\n\n\tRafe salutes as the Air Commander turns and then returns the\n\tsalute, with his left arm -- his right arm is gone.

BASSINGBORNE AIRFIELD - BRITAIN - DAY\n\n\tA Spitfire sits on the runway, and it's badly mangled -- a\n\tstring of bullet holes punched through at mid-fuselage; a\n\tshot-off chunk of wingtip; but most striking is the blood\n\tstill splattered over the inside of the cockpit.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBRITISH AIR COMMANDER\n\t\t\tGood lad.  Didn't die till he'd landed\n\t\t\tand shut down his engine.  Welcome to the\n\t\t\twar.\n\n\tHe walks away, leaving Rafe to stare at the bloody cockpit.\n\n\tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - MILITARY BASE - DAY\n\n\tEvelyn and the nurses enter the base, riding in two jeeps.\n\tAs they stop at the gate, the guards look at them, especially\n\tEvelyn in the lead jeep; one guard mumbles to the other --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGUARD\n\t\t\tI've died and gone to heaven.\n\n\tThe guards lift the bar and smile at the nurses.  The jeeps\n\tdrive through.  The nurses are loving this island paradise\n\talready.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBARBARA\n\t\t\tYou know the ratio of men to women on\n\t\t\tthis island?

THE DARK SKIES OVER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - DAY\n\n\tRafe, in the middle of an aerial dogfight, throws his\n\tSpitfire into a tight turn, swinging around to fire again\n\tinto a squadron of Messerschmidts; they outnumber the British\n\tplanes, and they're tougher and faster.  Rafe darts through\n\ttheir line, machine guns blazing.\n\n\tOne of the Spitfires in Rafe's squadron has taken hits in the\n\tengine compartment and is sputtering, losing power, its\n\tpilot, NIGEL, frantic as the German planes swarm into finish\n\thim.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBRITISH PILOT (NIGEL)\n\t\t\tI need help!  Someone get them off me!\n\n\tRafe slams his control stick hard right and goes into a power\n\tdive at one of the Messerschmidts.  Rafe's bullets chew up\n\tits cockpit and the plane goes into a fast corkscrew spiral,\n\tdown into the water.\n\n\tRafe instantly climbs again.  Nigel, in the moment of safety\n\tRafe has bought him, bails out, his chute blossoming and\n\tcarrying him toward the water.

It is cold here.  So cold,\n\t\t\tin a way that goes deep into your bones.\n\n\tThe Messerschmidt in Rafe's sights breaks apart with the\n\tstream of precise fire he pours into it, its prop flying into\n\tpieces, its disintegration accelerated by its airspeed.\n\tBefore it completely comes apart, it explodes.\n\n\tRafe goes into another tight turn, to get at them again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE'S VOICE (LETTER)\n\t\t\tIt's not easy making friends.

As the\n\tHawaiian waiter serves her an icy tropical ambrosia with\n\tchunks of pineapple and a fresh plumeria flower floating at\n\tthe rim of the glass, she lifts her pen.\n\n\tBut before she can start to write, three naval officers move\n\tover to her table from the bar.

JAPANESE HIGH COMMAND - NIGHT\n\n\tThe Conference Room is similar to that of the White House.\n\tBut this table is low and all the men sit on the floor.  And\n\tthere are no civilians here; Japan is now a nation ruled by\n\tits warriors.\n\n\tThe last man to enter the room and take his place is ADMIRAL\n\tYAMAMOTO.  Harvard educated, Yamamoto is an object of\n\tveneration and suspicion among the men of the war council.\n\tYamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend\n\tGenda, who can't hide his fear.  Yamamoto glances to the far\n\tend of the table where NISHIKURA, chief of the War Council,\n\tsits glowering.  (Their discussion is in Japanese, with\n\tsubtitles.)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNISHIKURA\n\t\t\tSo you join us, Admiral.  Some of us\n\t\t\tthought your education at an American\n\t\t\tuniversity would make you too weak to\n\t\t\tfight the Americans.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYAMAMOTO\n\t\t\tIf knowledge of opponents and careful\n\t\t\tcalculation of danger is taken as\n\t\t\tweakness then I have misunderstood what\n\t\t\tit means to be Japanese.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNISHIKURA\n\t\t\tThe time has come to strike!  Or to sit\n\t\t\tand let the Americans cut off our oil and\n\t\t\tour future.  I know what you whisper to\n\t\t\tthe others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans\n\t\t\tare strong.  Yet look at their leader.\n\n\tHe motions to OYAMA, an intelligence analyst, who opens a\n\tfile and lays out pictures of Roosevelt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOYAMA\n\t\t\tFranklin Roosevelt.  Born into great\n\t\t\twealth.  Fifteen years ago, he was\n\t\t\tstricken with polio.  Now he cannot walk,\n\t\t\tor even stand without help.\n\t\t\tPhotographers will not take pictures of\n\t\t\thim in his chair; Americans do not wish\n\t\t\tto know how weak their President is.\n\n\tYamamoto makes a low grunt.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNISHIKURA\n\t\t\tYou have something to say, Yamamoto?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYAMAMOTO\n\t\t\tThe Council knows I have opposed fighting\n\t\t\tthe Americans.  No matter how great our\n\t\t\tresolve, they have resources beyond ours.\n\t\t\tIf we must go to war, there is only one\n\t\t\tway -- deal them a blow from which it will\n\t\t\ttake them years to recover.  In that time\n\t\t\twe can conquer all of the Pacific, and\n\t\t\tthey will have no choice but to ask for\n\t\t\tpeace.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tNISHIKURA\n\t\t\tYou see us as capable of such a blow?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYAMAMOTO\n\t\t\tThe Americans themselves have made it\n\t\t\tpossible.  We will annihilate them in a\n\t\t\tsingle attack -- at Pearl Harbor.\n\n\tThe members of the war council are so pleased with Yamamoto\n\tthat they bow to him.  Only Genda keeps his eyes raised long\n\tenough to see the sadness in Yamamoto's face.\n\n\tEXT.

In the\n\tbunk beyond Coma's is another drunk pilot in a Hawaiian\n\tshirt...and to judge by the shapely bronzed leg that\n\tprotrudes from under his damp sheet, there's a woman with him\n\ttoo.\n\n\tDanny and his buddies are speechless -- except for Red\n\tStrange.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tI th-think I'm gonna like it here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMA\n\t\t\tYou guys are new?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCOMA\n\t\t\tMai-tai's.

So\n\t\t\tyou don't even look -- not ever.\n\n\tDanny releases him and Coma staggers back to the table to\n\tnuzzle up to one of the straws of the mai-tai volcano.\n\n\tDanny looks out the window again and sees Evelyn's beautiful\n\tform disappear around the corner, on her way back to the base\n\thospital.  Danny moves back to the table, and as two burly\n\tHawaiian waiters set another full loaded mai-tai volcano onto\n\tthe center of the table, he picks up a glass and dips it full\n\tof the potent liquid.

With the wooden\n\tfins the torpedo makes a sharp dip and levels off above the\n\tsea floor.\n\n\tABOVE THE SURFACE the planners see the path of the torpedo;\n\tit hits the wooden barrier with a satisfying THUNK.

His turn is so tight that the plane\n\tflexes with the g-force.\n\n\tRafe comes out of his turn ahead of the Squad Leader, and\n\traces back up through the formation of German bombers, moving\n\tabove them where their weapons and armaments are the weakest.\n\tHe stitches a trail of bullets from tail to nose of the\n\twounded lead bomber; it begins to smoke.\n\n\tThe second Spitfire, the Squad Leader's, takes fire from the\n\tother German bombers, and shears off, heading through the\n\tsmoke of the plane Rafe has on the ropes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tWe've got him going!\n\n\tRafe does a half-loop and half-spin, to bring him around to\n\tface the bombers again.  This time the g-force of the turn\n\tpops an oil line inside Rafe's cockpit; hot, pressurized oil\n\tbegins to spray everywhere -- all over Rafe, his controls,\n\tand worst of all, over the inside of his cockpit glass.\n\n\tHe wipes at the oil with his hands and that just smears it\n\tand makes it worse.\n\n\tHis wingman sees him veering away from the bombers...and sees\n\tthe German fighters moving up to meet him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUAD LEADER\n\t\t\tMcCawley!

BLAM!\n\tBLAM!  He blows out the glass; the smoke clears enough for\n\thim to take a breath and try to see.  He fights the stick,\n\tbut the plane won't respond.\n\n\tThe Messerschmidts rake him again, bullets riddling his\n\tengine.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUAD LEADER\n\t\t\tGet out of there, McCawley!  Get out of\n\t\t\tthere!\n\n\tRafe's plane descends, ever faster, passing through clouds,\n\tthen clear air again.  The Squad Leader tries to chase and\n\tcover him, but Rafe's dropping fast, and still isn't out of\n\tthe plane as the Germans dive on him again, firing.\n\n\tRafe's Spitfire hits the broken fog over the water -- the\n\tSquad Leader loses sight of it for a moment -- and then the\n\tplane hits, splashing and exploding all at once.\n\n\tThe Squad Leader winces, and ducks into the clouds as he\n\treports on his radio...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSQUAD LEADER\n\t\t\tMcCawley down.

Rafe was...he was lonely.  He\n\t\t\thad such high expectations of himself\n\t\t\tthat he always felt empty.  The week he\n\t\t\tmet you he told me he felt his heart had\n\t\t\talways lived in winter, and for the first\n\t\t\ttime in his life he has seen the spring.\n\n\tHe's been lost in his own thoughts of Rafe; now he notices\n\tthe tears welling up in her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tSorry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN\n\t\t\tHe told me he didn't want to leave me\n\t\t\twith regret.

He's cloaked in the fog; his\n\tparachute, pushed by the wind, is pulling him along face\n\tdown.  He fights with the straps, flips himself over, and\n\tpulls the release...\n\n\tBut he's still in desperate trouble; in his flying clothes,\n\this heavy leather jacket soaking with sea-water, he's going\n\tdown; his body sinks beneath the surface...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEVELYN'S VOICE\n\t\t\t...Every sunset...\n\n\tIN THE PRESENT, Rafe's chest trembles... Is it from the\n\tmemory of the frozen water, from the emotion of seeing Evelyn\n\tagain -- or both?\n\n\tSUBLIMINAL FLASHBACKS -- Below the surface of the North Sea,\n\tRafe's body drifts, but he fights his way back up...he kicks\n\toff his shoes, sheds the jacket, strips off his pants and\n\tstarts tying the cuffs into knots.\n\n\tThen, in a CUT, he is floating in the water, his pants turned\n\tinto a makeshift life preserver, his body shaking\n\tconvulsively from the cold.\n\n\tThen in another CUT we see him after he's been in the water\n\tfor so long that his body no longer trembles; he's lost\n\tconsciousness.  He has no strength, no will to live...

It's only in his mind, but that makes it no less\n\treal...an orange glow, the warmth of the sunset, and her face\n\tabove the surface... His limbs come to life, and he fights\n\this way up, breaking the surface.  The whole sea around him\n\tis dark and empty, but he grabs his makeshift preserver and\n\tholds on for dear life...and for Evelyn.\n\n\tIN THE PRESENT Rafe stares through the window, at Evelyn, but\n\the can't go in.

They\n\t\t\twere headed to Spain.  They docked in La\n\t\t\tRota, right beside a German ship, and\n\t\t\ttold me to stay hidden below.  I was\n\t\t\tafraid they'd turn me in, so I stole some\n\t\t\tclothes, jumped ship, and found a church,\n\t\t\twhere the priest contacted the\n\t\t\tresistance, and got me on a freighter to\n\t\t\tNew York.\n\n\tHe looks at her, then looks down again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI called my folks, then Colonel\n\t\t\tDoolittle.  The Colonel sent a man to\n\t\t\tpick me up.

BARRACKS - THE HEAD - DAY\n\n\tRed sleepwalks to the urinals and unleashes a marathon piss\n\tstream, still in his sleep.  A rumble penetrates his brain,\n\tand his eyes come open a fraction.  Through the window slits\n\tabove the urinals, he can see a cloud of Japanese planes\n\trushing past.\n\n\tHe squeezes his eyes shut, and looks again; the planes start\n\tbombing the distant hangers.\n\n\tRed pisses along the wall as he races to the barracks, trying\n\tto get his pecker back into his drawers.  He shouts to the\n\tsleeping guys --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tTh-th-th-th-th-\n\n\tHe slaps his face with both hands, and stomps his feet...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tTh-th-th-th-Dammit!

The Jaaaps!!\n\n\tHe's belting it like a baritone in a bizarre opera.  His\n\tfriends stir; what the hell?  Red points outside and tries to\n\ttalk, but now he can't mutter a syllable.  The guys hear the\n\texplosions, and realize...\n\n\tEXT.  HICKAM FIELD - BARRACKS - DAY\n\n\tThe pilots stagger out, half drunk, half dressed.  Seeing\n\twhat's happening, they race toward the flight line, where the\n\tclustered American planes are blowing up in groups, and the\n\tpilots are knocked to the ground.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBILLY\n\t\t\tGoddamn Japs!\n\n\tBilly jumps to his feet and starts to run toward a cluster of\n\tfighters that hasn't gone up yet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\t\tBilly!\n\n\tAnthony tries to grab him and drag him back to earth but he\n\tmisses; Billy gets a few steps before the fire from a\n\tstrafing Zero catches up to him; his friends watch in horror\n\tas Billy gets shorter as he runs; the Zero's machine gun fire\n\tis sawing his legs off from the feet up.\n\n\tBilly falls, legless but still alive; then a bomb falls\n\talmost on top of him, sending body parts over the pilots.\n\n\tTheir innocence, like America's, is gone in that moment.\n\n\tEXT.  ROAD TO MAIN AIRFIELD - DAY\n\n\tDanny and Rafe are in Danny's Buick, hung over and asleep,\n\tDanny in front, Rafe in back, and they're a miserable sight\n\t-- their shirts ripped, blood dried in a leak trail from one\n\tside of Rafe's nose and the corner of Danny's mouth.\n\n\tThe rumble of planes moving overhead makes them stir; the\n\trumble grows huge, as the shadows of a massive formation\n\tmakes the sunlight flicker.  Danny and Rafe squint up, their\n\theads pounding, and realize what they're seeing.  Suddenly\n\ttheir headaches are gone, and Danny's gunning the Buick down\n\tthe road, toward the base.\n\n\tEXT.  AIR BASE - DAY\n\n\tDanny blasts through the main gate; the guards are too busy\n\ttaking cover and haven't even closed the barrier.\n\n\tHe races to the tarmac, where some of the planes are still\n\tundamaged.  Rafe is out the door before the car stops\n\trolling, and Danny's right behind him.\n\n\tThey're running toward a cluster of fighters, when it goes up\n\twith a bomb blast.  Rafe and Danny dive at each other; their\n\tfirst instinct is to cover their best friend with their own\n\tbodies.\n\n\tThey look at each other on the ground.  They see machine gun\n\tbullets thudding into the planes on the flight line, and\n\tripping along the walls of the buildings.  It's as if the\n\twhole Japanese airforce is attacking this one base, and not\n\tleaving a single plane airworthy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tGet me into a plane!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tCome on!\n\n\tDanny sprints; Rafe follows.  Danny reaches a phone booth,\n\tand digs a dime from his pants.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tYou're making a phone call?!\n\n\tDanny dials, as waves of bullets sweep the area, and more\n\tplanes blow up on the flight line.

Get\n\t\t\tthose planes fueled and armed RIGHT NOW!\n\n\tHe runs back toward the car; Rafe, in the nonsense of battle,\n\treaches in to hang up the receiver, before Danny grabs him\n\tand leads him on a sprint to the car, as the phone booth\n\tshatters behind them from the strafing.\n\n\tOn the way to the car they dive back to the ground to avoid\n\tstrafing -- and see their friends lying nearby, in shock.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tANTHONY\n\t\t\tThey got Billy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tCome with us!\n\n\tHe and Rafe jump up and run again.  Anthony, Red, and several\n\tother pilots reach the Buick and dive in.

THE OKLAHOMA - STILL AT ANCHOR - DAY\n\n\tThe number of attacking planes seems endless -- and their\n\tstrategy flawless.  Torpedoes hitting one ship lifts its hull\n\twith a blast, enabling the next wave of torpedoes to rush\n\tunder and hit the next ship anchored behind.  The American\n\tbattleships are bobbing like see-saws.\n\n\tThe OKLAHOMA takes an entire barrage of torpedoes, blowing\n\tthirty foot holes along it's hull; the ship immediately\n\tbegins to list.\n\n\tINT.  THE OKLAHOMA - DAY\n\n\tDoors are wedged shut by the deformation of the structure;\n\tvertical ladders are becoming horizontal, and water is\n\tpouring in.  Men fight their way up against the water.\n\n\tINT.  INNER COMPARTMENT OF THE OKLAHOMA - DAY\n\n\tWater is up to the trapped sailor's waists when they grab a\n\twrench and start taking turns pounding S.O.S. in Morse code\n\ton the bulkhead.\n\n\tEXT.  DECK OF OKLAHOMA - DAY\n\n\tAs the listing grows more severe, sailors start jumping from\n\tthe deck into the water.  Still the Marines on deck are\n\tfiring back at the planes; some Marines are even using\n\thandguns.  But courage does not save them...\n\n\tTHE OKLAHOMA ROLLS OVER\n\n\tThe men still on its deck try to run, but it's not just the\n\tfires and the water they can't escape; the gun turrets' 1400\n\tpound shells break loose with the capsizing of the ship and\n\ttumble through everything like massive wrecking balls.\n\n\tThe sailors and marines, thrown into the water, struggle to\n\tget away from the suction as the giant battleship turns\n\tturtle.\n\n\tBELOW THE WATER men are sucked down with amazing force, every\n\thair on their heads streaming behind them as they're snatched\n\tto the depths.\n\n\tINSIDE THE OKLAHOMA, everyone and everything is spilling\n\tupside down.  The ship's generators sputter out and the\n\tlights go out.  The flashlights of the few sailors who can\n\tfind them cut raggedly through the darkness, and water spills\n\tin.  There is no escape.\n\n\tBELOW THE WATER, the Oklahoma's superstructure hits bottom;\n\tsome men are crushed there.  For others it's salvation, as\n\tthe BACKWASH blows them toward the surface.\n\n\tON THE SURFACE the men are launched almost completely out of\n\tthe water, before splashing back into the water and burning\n\toil.  A few feet of the steel hull and a portion of the\n\tpropeller protrude above the surface, but most of the\n\tOklahoma is under water.\n\n\tMen in the water swim toward a medical launch carrying\n\twounded away from the wreckage.  A bomb hits the launch and\n\tblows body parts everywhere.\n\n\tINT.  OKLAHOMA - REAR COMPARTMENT\n\n\tIn one compartment there are a dozen trapped men.  They've\n\tsurvived the roll-over, and are in a chaotic world where the\n\tfloor is now the ceiling.  The water is up their waists.\n\tSome of the SAILORS are panicking.\n\n\tOne sailor has a flashlight and switches it on, flashing the\n\tlight from face to face.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT\n\t\t\tDon't panic!  Don't panic!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPANICKED SAILOR\n\t\t\tThe water's rising!

Several\n\tof the sailors are still screaming...\n\n\tThe water's already to their bellies.  One of them grabs a\n\twrench and starts slamming Morse code against the bulkhead.\n\n\tOne sailor in the middle of the room is particularly\n\tpanicked, not just yelling but crying and whimpering --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTERRIFIED SAILOR\n\t\t\tGet me out!  Get me out!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT\n\t\t\tStop it!  Come on!  Save your air!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTERRIFIED SAILOR\n\t\t\tMY FOOT'S CAUGHT!\n\n\tHe's at the lower end of the compartment, where the water is\n\tdeeper -- the ship's nose is lower than her stern.  The\n\twater's up to the guy's neck.\n\n\tThe man with the flashlight dives down, and finds the guys\n\tfoot wedged together in the pipes of the ships ceiling -- now\n\ttheir floor.\n\n\tHe pops up again.  The water's up to the trapped guy's mouth;\n\the's already gagging.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSAILOR WITH THE FLASHLIGHT\n\t\t\tIs there a hacksaw in that locker?!\n\n\tThey open it; tools spill out -- among them is a hacksaw.\n\tThey hand it to him; the sailor dives down and cuts off the\n\tguy's foot.\n\n\tThe trapped man is underwater, muffling his scream.  He comes\n\tfree, and surfaces gasping.  His severed foot floats to the\n\tsurface and then the horror really hits them.  The sailor\n\twith the flashlight pops up, in the blossoming of blood.  He\n\tand another sailor tie a tourniquet around the stump, to stop\n\tthe bleeding.\n\n\tThe drama of this has caused the other trapped men to stop\n\ttheir signaling.  Now they start banging, twice as loudly as\n\tbefore.\n\n\tEXT.  HALEIWA - AUXILIARY AIRFIELD - DAY\n\n\tHaleiwa is a tiny airfield, tucked among the green volcanic\n\thills; its barely paved, and it's only permanent building is\n\ta quonset hut.

There are sandbags around the hut, and\n\tthey run there, diving into it's shelter just before the\n\tfirst strafing pass, when a Zero strafes one of the P-40's\n\tand a dive bomber blasts another.

QUONSET HUT - DAY\n\n\tThe other pilots run in, throw open the gun locker, and start\n\tgrabbing weapons -- aircraft machine guns, ammo belts, one\n\teven grabs a rifle.\n\n\tSANDBAGS BY THE SHED\n\n\tThe two groups run back and start to set up.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny, over there!

This time the lead plane\n\thits a wall of steel fired from the combined guns; the\n\tbullets chew into the bomb it carries and the plane EXPLODES.\n\tThe airborne debris makes the following planes shear off.\n\n\tRed's standing, firing; he yells at the Zeros --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tD-don't like it when we fight back, do\n\t\t\tya!\n\n\tRed runs out with his machine gun and keeps firing even when\n\tthe planes have passed, trying to shoot them right up the\n\tass.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tEarl!

He still forces\n\tthe plane forward.  He taxis twenty feet and his cockpit gets\n\tchopped up and the plane arches into a right turn and putters\n\tto a stop, Theo dead at the controls.\n\n\tJoe doesn't bother to strap in; he hits the throttle hard and\n\theads down the runway...\n\n\tThe Zeros are on him as he gets ten feet of air at 120 M.P.H.\n\tThe Zero's bullets eat his canopy and plane skin; the plane\n\tbreaks apart in mid air, spilling in gouts of flame as it\n\tsmashes down on the tarmac.\n\n\tRafe and Danny have reaches the more distant P-40's and are\n\trevving their engines as they see Joe and Theo's fate.  They\n\tthrow on their radio headsets.\n\n\tTheir way seems blocked:  they've got no runway behind them,\n\tthe wreckage of four P-40's scattered ahead of them, and the\n\tZeros screaming over the low hills to attack them.

They fly like crop dusters,\n\tskimming down a foot from the ground, then bobbing up,\n\tbanking left and right.  The Zeros have divided into two\n\tgroups to chase them, their wings clipping tree tops as they\n\ttry to follow the Americans.\n\n\tIt feels like a 200 M.P.H. car chase, 20 feet off the ground,\n\tRafe and Danny skimming and bobbing over the terrain, but\n\tthere are too many Japanese.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny!

But\n\ttheir day of shooting sitting ducks changes as the two P-40's\n\tblast in, wing guns blazing, chopping into Two Zeros.  Both\n\tZeros falter and begin to lose altitude.  The P-40's make\n\talmost impossible tight turns, still side-by-side, and go\n\tafter the two plane they crippled on the first pass.\n\n\tRafe finishes one Zero, making it explode in a ball of flame\n\tin the air.  Danny finishes the other, shooting off its wing\n\tso that it spirals into the sea and crashes there.\n\n\tThe P-40's swoop up again.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tThey're trying to hold formation.

ANOTHER JAPANESE FORMATION OF BOMBERS - DAY\n\n\tThese planes are different -- high altitude bombers with\n\tthree-man crews, high above the harbor.  The bombardier looks\n\tthrough his sight and the bomb bays open.\n\n\tTHROUGH THE BOMBARDIER'S SIGHT, the ships look like tops, far\n\tbelow.

Ah, Arizona.\n\n\tHe flips his bomb switch, and a HUGE STEEL BOMB falls away.\n\n\tEXT.  THE FLIGHT OF THE BOMB - DAY\n\n\tWe stay with the bomb as it falls through the sky.  The small\n\tpropeller on the bomb's nose spins in the air, running the\n\tarming mechanism into the bomb's explosive core.  The bomb\n\twobbles a bit at first, but then as it gathers speed its fins\n\tstabilize it, and it falls faster and faster, at a dizzying\n\trate, toward the Arizona.\n\n\tIt slams through the teak wood deck, and breaks it like\n\tmatchsticks.\n\n\tIt's tremendous weight and speed carry it through the next\n\tdeck, and the next, deep into the heart of the ship...toward\n\tthe powder room, where two million pounds of black powder are\n\twaiting.\n\n\tThe bomb hits there, and the explosion is almost beyond\n\tcomprehension.  Over 1400 men die instantly.\n\n\tEXT.  PEARL HARBOR - DAY\n\n\tThe battleship Arizona leaps into the air, the ship's spine\n\tis broken, it's guts ripped open in one explosive instant.\n\tMen on the deck are thrown into the burning oil already\n\tfloating on the water from the other ruptured ships, but\n\tthere are almost no survivors.\n\n\tThe concussion of the explosion blows men off the repair ship\n\tVestal, next to the Arizona, saving Vestal, as the explosion\n\tsnuffs out the fires on Vestal; it also sends tons of debris\n\tdown on her decks -- parts of the ship, legs, arms and heads\n\tof men, all sorts of bodies.\n\n\tDebris from the Arizona also cover the Tennessee and does\n\tmore damage than the two Japanese bombs that hit her.\n\n\tINT.

One torpedo plane, its pilot flying\n\tblind, clips the superstructure of a battleship and spins to\n\ta crash.\n\n\tStill, even IN THE CHAOS ON THE SHIPS, the sailors struggle\n\tto survive, inventively.  Men trapped on one burning ship use\n\tthe severed barrel of a five-inch naval gun as a bridge to\n\tcross to the less damaged ship anchored beside them.\n\n\tOthers jump into the water and swim through the burning oil,\n\ttowing buddies too wounded to swim themselves.\n\n\tEXT.

RAFE'S PLANE - ABOVE TOKYO - DAY\n\n\tRafe pushes the engines to top speed and changes course\n\tagain; but the B-25's can't outrun the Zeros.  Their fire\n\tchews into the bomber's tail, hitting the gunner.  Red\n\tscrambles back to find the gunner dead.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tCan you get 'em off us?\n\n\tRed reacting to bullets coming through the rear of the\n\tfuselage, looks at the brooms protruding from the rear of the\n\tplane.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRED\n\t\t\tWhatta ya want me to do, sweep 'em!\n\n\tAs the bombardier, navigator, and Red jump onto the other\n\tmachine guns, Rafe looks for a way out.  He dives down toward\n\tthe city.  The Zeros follow.\n\n\tEXT.  SKIES OVER TOKYO - DAY\n\n\tRafe takes the B-25 right down among the buildings, sometimes\n\teven having to spin the wings to get through.  The Zeros\n\tcan't keep up with this...\n\n\tBut Rafe can't keep it up long, either; they break out into\n\topen ground rail yards, where there's no place for him to\n\thide...\n\n\tThe Zeros come in to chew him up...\n\n\tBut they take fire from another B-25 -- Danny's -- coming in\n\tto save Rafe's plane.  Rafe now uses the radio.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny, get the hell out of here!\n\n\tBut Danny stays, mixing it up with the Zeros; with both\n\tB-25's together, their machine guns down one Zero and damage\n\tanother.  But there are too many.\n\n\tRafe sees clouds coming in, and fog.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny, run for the clouds!\n\n\tThe bombers race toward the clouds, and make it; the Zeros\n\tlose them.\n\n\tEXT.

And the planes had to\n\t\t\ttake off so early they may lack fuel to\n\t\t\tmake the mainland anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tROOSEVELT\n\t\t\tSo those brave men are flying blind and\n\t\t\trunning out of fuel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGENERAL MARSHALL\n\t\t\tThe Chinese are sending out search\n\t\t\tparties to try to find the crews before\n\t\t\tthe Jap patrols do, if any of the planes\n\t\t\tmake it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tROOSEVELT\n\t\t\tGod help them.\n\n\tEXT.

HOSPITAL - PEARL HARBOR - DUSK\n\n\tThe place is white again -- the white of bandages and casts.\n\tEveryone is busy, and even the wounded are looking out for\n\teach other; a man with his arms in an airplane splint holds a\n\tspoon and feeds a badly burned buddy.  Evelyn and her\n\toverworked nurses are looking after the critical cases.  But\n\tas she covers the windows with blackout curtains, she stops\n\tfor just a moment to stare at the sun's last rays.\n\n\tEXT.

Three guys go out; it's just Doolittle and his\n\tcopilot left.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDOOLITTLE\n\t\t\tNobody else is gonna make it either.

And I can't\n\t\t\tfind the beacon.\n\n\tDanny gestures across to Rafe that he hears nothing in his\n\tradio phones.  Rafe gestures the same thing back.\n\n\tThey look down and the entire ground is covered with clouds.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI don't know if we're over sea or land.\n\t\t\tDrop flares and try to spot something.\n\n\tEXT.

G-O.  You go on.\n\n\tRafe grabs the flasher and angrily flashes back two letters.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tN-O!  We stay together!  I'll go in\n\t\t\tfirst.\n\n\tRafe turns his bomber and Danny follows, their planes arcing\n\tdown toward the rocky coast; it's hairy, the clouds masking\n\ttheir view, as the altimeter winds down... At the last moment\n\tthey see rocks looming out of the surf.\n\n\tINT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT\n\n\tHe's shouting to his crew --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tHang on tight!  I'll put her in the\n\t\t\tsmooth water and we'll swim in!\n\n\tINT.  DANNY'S PLANE - NIGHT\n\n\tHis engines are sputtering, catching, sputtering; he fights\n\tto stay in control.\n\n\tEXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT\n\n\tRafe's plane settles down toward the water; he guns the\n\tengine to level out, and the plane skims across the surface;\n\tthen the propellers catch and the plane stops like it hit a\n\twall, flipping over it's nose.\n\n\tDANNY'S PLANE is struggling; when he tries to add throttle,\n\tthe engines sputter out.  The plane drops, skips once on the\n\tsurface, then hits a shoreline rock belly first.\n\n\tDanny and Anthony are ejected through the top of the\n\tfuselage; Coma is hurled forward right through the glass nose\n\tof the plane.\n\n\tINT.  RAFE'S PLANE - NIGHT\n\n\tRafe and Red come to in the plane inverted and sinking.  They\n\treact, unbuckling, grabbing for their crewmates as the plane\n\tis quickly filling.  The navigator and gunner are\n\tunconscious; the bombardier is dead.  Red struggles with the\n\thatch and can't make it budge.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tIt won't open til the plane fills!\n\n\tThey struggle to breath as the water envelops them.  But as\n\tthe water reaches the top, Rafe takes a last breath and dives\n\tto the hatch; it comes open, and they swim up, dragging the\n\trest of the crew.\n\n\tEXT.  CHINA COAST - NIGHT\n\n\tThey break the surface, and struggle to shore with the\n\tunconscious navigator and gunner.\n\n\tRafe's looking everywhere; he sees Danny's plane crashed\n\tagainst the rock.  He fights his way through the surf to\n\tDanny's plane, Red following.\n\n\tRafe finds Danny face up in the water.\n\n\tRed finds Anthony on the rock.  He's face up, but as Red\n\tlifts him he finds the back of Anthony's head is gone.\n\n\tThe rest of Danny's crew are floating in the surf, dead.\n\tRafe and Red pull Danny to shore.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny!  DANNY!\n\n\tDanny's eyes flutter open; he sees Rafe and mumbles --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tI've made better landings.\n\n\tDanny's hand gropes to his throat; Rafe finds a V shaped\n\tshard of the fuselage hooked into his neck.\n\n\tRafe grabs it, trying to bend it open; the sharp metal cuts\n\this hands, but he keeps straining.  It won't work, He pulls\n\this .45 from his jacket and tries to pry the metal.  It works\n\ta bit; he tosses the pistol aside and grabs the shard again,\n\tand opens it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tYou hang on, Danny!  You hang on!  You're\n\t\t\tgonna make it!\n\n\tRafe's head snaps forward, crunched with the butt of a rifle;\n\ta Japanese patrol, four men, have arrived.  They're angry,\n\tscared, hyped.  They knock Red down too, yelling and\n\tbrandishing their rifles at the fliers on the beach, living\n\tand dead.\n\n\tThe Japanese officer is barking orders.  They find the\n\tCaptain's insignia on Danny's jacket, and begin binding him\n\tto a yoke, his wrists tied to the wood like a crucifixion, a\n\twire around his neck.  They find the navigator unconscious,\n\tbut alive.  The officer snaps a single word and a soldier\n\tshoots the navigator.\n\n\tThe others wire Rafe's ankles together... Rafe is\n\temotionless.\n\n\tRAFE'S CONSCIOUSNESS fades in and out.  He hears Danny\n\tchoking, and his mind sees Danny as a boy those long years\n\tago, being carried by the neck across the field by his\n\tfather...\n\n\tThen Rafe sees THE PRESENT:  Danny being half-carried, half-\n\tdragged by the neck by two Japanese.  The officer is pulling\n\tRed along, hands bound behind him.  And Rafe starts moving,\n\tbeing dragged on his back, pulled by his feet along the rocky\n\tsand.\n\n\tHis hand slides by the pistol he tossed behind the rock.\n\n\tThe whole world slows down.\n\n\tHe clutches it, shoots one of the men towing Danny.  And as\n\tthe man dragging Rafe turns around, Rafe shoots him in the\n\tface.\n\n\tThe officer spins, raising his rifle; the soldier pulling\n\tRed, shoves him onto his face in the sand and aims his rifle\n\ttoo.  The officer is pulling the trigger to kill Rafe when\n\tDanny slams him down from behind.\n\n\tThe fourth soldier shoots Danny in the gut, then takes aim\n\tfor Rafe's heart -- and is shot through the chest from\n\tbehind.\n\n\tThe Japanese officers rises in surprise and is cut down by\n\tscythes carried by the Chinese peasant soldiers who are just\n\tarriving.\n\n\tRafe struggles to Danny, moving the Chinese aside.  Danny\n\tlies on his back, clutching his wound as if to hold onto his\n\tlife.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tI can't make it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tYes you can.\n\n\tBut Danny is silent, his eyes drifting shut, and in that\n\tmoment Rafe thinks he is gone already.  Then Danny's eyes\n\tdrift open, finding him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tTake care of Evelyn.\n\n\tThe words almost kill Rafe, filling him with grief.  From\n\tsomewhere he finds the strength to say --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tI will.  And your baby.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tYou're gonna be a father.\n\n\tDid Danny hear?  His eyes are closed again.  But his head\n\tcomes up; Rafe takes it, and Danny pulls him closer to\n\twhisper --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDANNY\n\t\t\tNo.  You are.\n\n\tRafe cradles Danny in his arms.  Danny's eyes are open, but\n\tRafe sees no light there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFE\n\t\t\tDanny... Land of the free... Land of the\n\t\t\tfree...\n\n\tBut Danny will never answer him again.  Rafe hugs Danny\n\ttight, and weeps.\n\n\tEXT.  VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY\n\n\tThe news of the raid hits Washington...and the rest of\n\tAmerica.  If it isn't wild celebration; when people see the\n\theadline:  AIR RAID ON TOKYO, and DOOLITTLE DOES MUCH; their\n\tfaces change, as if finally told what they already knew --\n\tthat America would prevail.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tVOICE OVER\n\t\t\tThe Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment\n\t\t\tof America's war with Japan.  Before it,\n\t\t\tAmerica knew nothing but defeat; after\n\t\t\tit, nothing but victory.\n\t\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t\tOne crew of Doolittle's raiders made it to\n\t\t\tVladivostok, Russia, where they were\n\t\t\tinterred for much of the war.  Thirteen\n\t\t\tplanes crash landed in China, where the\n\t\t\tChinese people helped the Americans\n\t\t\tescape, and had their villages destroyed\n\t\t\tand citizens executed by the Japanese\n\t\t\tforces of occupation.  Two crews were\n\t\t\tcaptured by the Japanese and three fliers\n\t\t\twere executed without trial, called \"war\n\t\t\tcriminals\" by the Japanese.  Jimmy\n\t\t\tDoolittle was promoted to General, and\n\t\t\tgiven the medal of honor.\n\n\tWe see the ceremony at the White House, as Roosevelt presents\n\tDoolittle with the metal.\n\n\tEXT.
