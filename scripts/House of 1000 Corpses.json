FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny \n               hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body \n               of GRAMPA.\n\n               Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over \n               the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.\n\n<b>                                     GRAMPA\n</b>                         God damn it, I can do it. I can do \n                         it myself, ya big monkey.

Tiny picks him up in his arms \n               and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.\n\n               As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE \n               OBJECT sitting on a shelf.\n\n               A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled \n               punk looks to have a small second head growing from its \n               temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.\n\n               The sound from the TV fades up in the background.\n\n               BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.\n\n<b>                                     BELA LUGOSI (V.O.)\n</b>                         Your hands, please.

The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides \n               open. Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back \n               of the truck.\n\n               SLAM! The metal door shuts.\n\n<b>               EXT. ROAD - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the \n               farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows, \n               grinning their evil grin.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>House of 1000 Corpses</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Rob Zombie\" title=\"Scripts by Rob Zombie\">Rob Zombie</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/House of 1000 Corpses Script.html#comments\" title=\"House of 1000 Corpses comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:38.030218"}
