FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny \n               hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body \n               of GRAMPA.\n\n               Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over \n               the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.\n\n                                     GRAMPA\n                         God damn it, I can do it. I can do \n                         it myself, ya big monkey.

Tiny picks him up in his arms \n               and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.\n\n               As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE \n               OBJECT sitting on a shelf.\n\n               A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled \n               punk looks to have a small second head growing from its \n               temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.\n\n               The sound from the TV fades up in the background.\n\n               BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.\n\n                                     BELA LUGOSI (V.O.)\n                         Your hands, please.

The room is modest, but comfortable.\n\n               He reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock, notices \n               the time, concerned look comes over his face.\n\n               The phone rings.

CAR - NIGHT\n\n               From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten. \n               The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle. \n               The scarecrows continue to pound on the car.\n\n               As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.\n\n                                                                   FADE TO:\n\n               EXT.

All is still.\n\n               The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning \n               silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind \n               the house.

Sunlight peers \n               through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered \n               remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves \n               as wallpaper surrounding the window.\n\n               Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG \n               EYED KITTEN.

For the first time we see the skin on \n               his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars.\n\n               He is holding a small tray.

She gets up \n               and stumbles back into a wooden cross.

Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we \n               see them crushed together.\n\n               Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is \n               inside Otis slams the door shut.\n\n               Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern \n               and a small tape recorder playing music.\n\n               INT.

The coffin begins \n               to violently shake. Denise screams.\n\n               Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin \n               is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction.\n\n               He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the \n               darkness.\n\n                                     DENISE\n                         Jerry!

He exits a few moments later, dragging a \n               huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes \n               the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.\n\n               EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\n               Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate \n               system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the \n               many automobiles beneath.\n\n               Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove \n               the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He \n               climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and \n               starts the engine. He drives off.\n\n               INT.

As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder. \n               She turns the corner to see:\n\n               TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a \n               shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise, \n               revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.\n\n               The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood, \n               they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.\n\n               Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist \n               in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs \n               straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of \n               the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked, \n               cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.\n\n               They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run \n               into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.\n\n               EXT.

She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face \n               of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to \n               laugh.\n\n               The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The \n               car drives off.\n\n               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\n\n               Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He \n               implants it into the ground.

In the distance she hears high pitched \n               animal sounds.\n\n               A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands \n               silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled \n               fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to \n               pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls \n               her closer, CLAWING at her face.\n\n               Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls \n               backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces \n               and starts to run.\n\n               EXT.

She gets to \n               the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS \n               move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.\n\n               The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise \n               frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next \n               to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.\n\n               The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the \n               ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying \n               to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling \n               above her, trying to break free.\n\n               Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being \n               torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly \n               a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:\n\n               STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes \n               her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another \n               piece.\n\n               With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up \n               through the opening.\n\n               EXT.

She \n               crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.\n\n               She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through \n               the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull \n               her back into the hole.\n\n               Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul. \n               She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.\n\n               EXT.
