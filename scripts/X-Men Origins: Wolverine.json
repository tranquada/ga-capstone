RURAL ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n          A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering\n          black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops,\n          heading south before the first snowfall.\n          A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag\n          strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy\n          looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.\n          Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in\n          the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a\n          hard-charging engine.\n          An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it\n          hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but\n          the car comes straight at him.\n          The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down\n          on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to\n          spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.\n          Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their\n          leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the\n          four, shakes his head and laughs.\n\n<b>          GILMAN\n</b>          Kid didn't even move.

Blood spills from a gash in his\n          cheek where the class ring cut him.\n\n<b>          MASON\n</b>          (a ringside announcer)\n          Right cross to the face... and he's\n          down!\n          The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.\n          The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his\n          face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.\n\n<b>          GILMAN\n</b>          What's the matter? You want some\n          more?\n          The boy doesn't look away.

The gash on the boy's cheek knits\n          itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.\n          Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing\n          toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch.\n          And then another.\n          The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights\n          with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and\n          headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.\n          Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down,\n          trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.\n          Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite\n          to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.\n          The other two football players, amazed to see their leader\n          getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.\n          The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's\n          collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground,\n          prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.\n          Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and\n          razor sharp.\n          Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits\n          hollering and stares. The other two football players blink\n          and slowly back away.\n          Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl\n          backwards, away from this beast on top of him.\n\n<b>          ((\"ONTTN11F.1)1\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          4.\n</b>\n<b>          CONTINUED: (3)\n</b>          But the boy is more shocked than-any of them.

Mason runs over,\n          lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him\n          toward the Oldsmobile.\n          The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and\n          speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.\n          The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see\n          fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the\n          black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.\n\n<b>          INT.
