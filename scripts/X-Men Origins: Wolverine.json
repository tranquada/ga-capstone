RURAL ROAD - DAY\n\n          A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering\n          black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops,\n          heading south before the first snowfall.\n          A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag\n          strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy\n          looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.\n          Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in\n          the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a\n          hard-charging engine.\n          An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it\n          hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but\n          the car comes straight at him.\n          The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down\n          on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to\n          spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.\n          Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their\n          leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the\n          four, shakes his head and laughs.\n\n          GILMAN\n          Kid didn't even move. You see that?\n          Where's your survival instincts,\n          boy?\n          The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes\n          his long walk northward.\n          GILMAN (cont'd)\n          Hey!\n          Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around-\n          GILMAN (cont'd)\n          The hell you going? You hear me\n          talking to you?\n          One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and\n          inspects the boy's face.\n\n          MASON\n          This is the kid whose old man\n          robbed the truck stop last year.\n          Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck\n          and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen\n          tower over the small boy.\n          I C_ONTTNTT f 1\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n\n          GILMAN\n          You the one with the convict daddy?\n          The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.\n\n          MASON\n          That's him.\n\n          GILMAN\n          What's the matter, you about to\n          piss your pants? Answer me.\n          The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully.\n          Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring,\n          against the.boy's cheek.\n          GILMAN (cont'd)\n          You a tough guy like your daddy?\n          Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The\n          boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.\n          GILMAN (cont'd)\n          You want to play tough guy with me?\n          Huh?\n          Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his\n          stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face.\n          The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his\n          cheek where the class ring cut him.\n\n          MASON\n          (a ringside announcer)\n          Right cross to the face... and he's\n          down!\n          The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.\n          The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his\n          face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.\n\n          GILMAN\n          What's the matter? You want some\n          more?\n          The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy\n          in the side of the head, knocking him down again.\n          GILMAN (cont'd)\n          (to his friends)\n          Let's get out of here.\n\n          CONTTNTTF:T) I\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.\n\n          MASON\n          You gave that little pissant\n          something to think about.\n          Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be\n          sprawled and crying on the ground.\n          Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt,\n          and walks toward Gilman.\n\n          GILMAN\n          You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna\n          knock the--\n          But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something\n          impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits\n          itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.\n          Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing\n          toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch.\n          And then another.\n          The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights\n          with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and\n          headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.\n          Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down,\n          trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.\n          Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite\n          to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.\n          The other two football players, amazed to see their leader\n          getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.\n          The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's\n          collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground,\n          prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.\n          Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and\n          razor sharp.\n          Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits\n          hollering and stares. The other two football players blink\n          and slowly back away.\n          Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl\n          backwards, away from this beast on top of him.\n\n          ((\"ONTTN11F.1)1\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n          But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with\n          horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed.\n          He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over,\n          lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him\n          toward the Oldsmobile.\n          The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and\n          speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.\n          The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see\n          fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the\n          black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.\n\n          INT.

Keep walking till your\n          feet start to bleed.\n          Stryker turns and walks away.\n          Kayla crawls over to Logan. She lifts his head onto her lap.\n          He's unconscious but breathing. The bullet holes in his skin\n          have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles sadly.\n          One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her\n          leg. She takes it and looks down at the blank page.\n          She has no pen. She touches her chest, just above her heart,\n          wetting her finger with her blood.\n          She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it,\n          folds it once and places it in Logan's hand.\n          She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground.\n          Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand.\n          KAYLA (cont'd)\n          If you ever remember what I did to\n          you, try to forgive me. I was a\n          fool. And you were right... I\n          always loved you.\n          She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back,\n          never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above\n          her waist, above her shoulders, above her head.\n\n          EXT.

The woods are empty.\n          He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world.\n          He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand.\n          He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood.\n          You are my Wolverine.\n          He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and\n          putting it in his pocket.\n          f C ONTTNIIRD)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          102.\n\n          CONTINUED:\n          He takes a deep breath of cold air and walks west, toward the\n          falling sun.\n          He doesn't know who he is.
