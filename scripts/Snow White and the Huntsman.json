GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 1\r\n\r\n          From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a blanket\r\n          of snow. We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful\r\n          WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0.)\r\n          Once upon a time, in deep winter, a Queen\r\n          was admiring the falling snow when she saw\r\n          a rose blooming in defiance of the cold.\r\n          The rose looks miraculously red. Nearby, a RAVEN looks on. The\r\n          Queen gazes at the flower, then bends down.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0.)\r\n          Reaching for it, she pricked her finger and\r\n          three drops of blood fell.\r\n          BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell, a DROP OF BLOOD\r\n          lands in the snow. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER.\r\n          The Queen startles, then calmly touches her stomach.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0.)\r\n          And because the red seemed so alive against\r\n          the white, she thought, if only I had a\r\n          child as white as snow, lips as red as\r\n          blood, hair as black as a raven's wings and\r\n          all with the strength of that rose.\r\n          A beat, then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --\r\n\r\n          2 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 2\r\n\r\n          We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and\r\n          PHYSICIANS. Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of\r\n          water, dirty sponges, astrology charts and protection charms --\r\n          until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.O.)\r\n          Soon after, a daughter was born to the\r\n          Queen and was named \"Snow White.\"\r\n          With a radiant smile, the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her proud\r\n          father, KING MAGNUS. The baby's CRIES grow louder as the King\r\n          cradles her gently in his arms, turning towards a mirror.\r\n\r\n          ERIC V/O\r\n          And she was adored throughout the kingdom\r\n          as much for her defiant spirit as for her\r\n          beauty.\r\n\r\n          3 EXT. WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY. 3\r\n\r\n          A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water. SNOW WHITE,\r\n          aged 7 now, steps towards it hesitantly, looking concerned.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            2\r\n\r\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\r\n\r\n          YOUNG SNOW WHITE\r\n          Pick it up, William.\r\n          Her companion, William, also 7, braces himself, reaches down,\r\n          then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly. He\r\n          tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable.\r\n\r\n                         YOUNG WILLIAM\r\n          It's dying. It doesn't want to be touched.\r\n          Snow White ignores him, approaching the bird herself. She kneels\r\n          down, hesitates, then reaches out and strokes the magpie,\r\n          calming its flapping before she picks it up.\r\n          High up on a tree, ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on.\r\n\r\n          4 EXT. SEASIDE VILLAGE/ CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4\r\n\r\n          SNOW WHITE runs, cupping the wounded bird in her hand, William\r\n          dashing after her. The sun is out and the fields and forests are\r\n          lit up in all their glory. The children sprint through a\r\n          BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower gardens,\r\n          HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --\r\n\r\n          YOUNG SNOW WHITE\r\n          Hurry, William! Hurry!\r\n          They run down the dunes, waves crashing, the sand gleaming in\r\n          the sunlight, until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead --\r\n\r\n          5 EXT. CLOISTER GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY 5\r\n\r\n           A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters. It\r\n           stands out. Snow White and William dash past it into the castle.\r\n\r\n                         6 OMITTED 6\r\n\r\n          7 INT. ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY. 7\r\n\r\n          Snow White bursts into her parent's chamber. The King and Queen\r\n          turn from the window. Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance. Snow\r\n          White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her mother's\r\n          smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks heartbroken.\r\n\r\n          YOUNG SNOW WHITE\r\n          We found it in the woods.\r\n          The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White. The King\r\n          looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow White's hair and\r\n          carefully binds the magpie's wing. William watches from the\r\n          doorway, noticing how frail the Queen looks.\r\n          The magpie's flapping gradually calms, its pain easing.\r\n\r\n                         QUEEN\r\n          It will heal in time.\r\n          Snow White's eyes are fixed on the little bird.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            3\r\n\r\n                         7 CONTINUED: 7\r\n\r\n                         SNOW WHITE\r\n          I'll look after it.\r\n          The King watches Snow White, hiding his sorrow behind a smile.\r\n          So does the Queen, holding back her tears.\r\n\r\n                         QUEEN\r\n          You possess a rare beauty, my love. In\r\n          here.\r\n          (She touches Snow white's heart)\r\n          Never lose it. Hold it dear. You will need\r\n          its strength to one day become Queen.\r\n\r\n          8 EXT. CLOISTER GARDEN/ CASTLE - DAY. 8\r\n\r\n          Snow White and William, with a small toy bow strapped to his\r\n          back, climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister\r\n          gardens. William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and\r\n          offers it to Snow White.\r\n          He makes a point of the offer, holding it out, nodding.\r\n          Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a\r\n          huge bite himself, grinning. Snow White shoves him off the\r\n          tree and they fall to the ground.\r\n          And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and William's father,\r\n          DUKE HAMMOND, watching from the throne room balcony.\r\n\r\n                         KING MAGNUS\r\n          My daughter will need your son's friendship\r\n          more than ever, Duke Hammond.

GARDENS/ CASTLE - DAY. 8a\r\n          The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now. King\r\n          Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white, heartbroken.\r\n          A single tear rolls down Snow White's cheek. Palace onlookers\r\n          and mourners, fixed on her face, feeling what she feels, move\r\n          aside.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0)\r\n          A year went by but the King was\r\n          inconsolable. Taking advantage of his\r\n          grief, dark forces gathered on the\r\n          kingdom's borders.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            4\r\n\r\n                         9 OMITTED 9\r\n\r\n          10 EXT. FOREST/ BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10\r\n\r\n           From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter a\r\n           clearing. At the head is --\r\n          King Magnus, with Duke Hammond by his side, surrounded by a\r\n          line of the King's Army. They are frozen as they look at--\r\n          Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line. THE RIDERS are\r\n          silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of faceless\r\n          warriors.\r\n          King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -\r\n\r\n                         DUKE HAMMOND\r\n          From what hell comes this army?\r\n\r\n                         KING MAGNUS\r\n          A hell they'll soon revisit!\r\n          King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY, kicks his horse and rides\r\n          forward with blind courage, no longer caring what happens to\r\n          him.\r\n          The two lines of warriors race, pell-mell to the center of\r\n          the battlefield. When they meet --\r\n          Hand to hand combat at its most brutal.\r\n          King Magnus swings his great sword, and a SHADOW WARRIOR\r\n\r\n          SHATTERS LIKE GLASS.\r\n          All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors\r\n          shattering, evaporating.\r\n          Strange.\r\n          DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and\r\n          furious as the battlefield was only moments before, it is now\r\n          that quiet.\r\n          The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the\r\n          SHADOW ARMY melts away, DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST until\r\n          all that is left in the field is --\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0.)\r\n          The unholy army was defeated, leaving\r\n          King Magnus with the spoils of victory.\r\n          A CAGED PRISON WAGON. Odd. Not even sure how it got there.\r\n          King Magnus moves toward it, with a little trepidation. When\r\n          he's close he gets off his horse, walks closer and dares to\r\n          look inside.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            5\r\n\r\n                         10 CONTINUED: 10\r\n          Inside the cage, a WOMAN COWERS, her face hidden behind a veil.\r\n          King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars, then with a\r\n          mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters.\r\n\r\n                         KING MAGNUS\r\n          You are now free. You have nothing to fear\r\n          from me.\r\n          Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage, a bit wary, as the\r\n          King kneels beside the terrified woman.\r\n\r\n                         KING MAGNUS\r\n          What is your name, my lady?\r\n          Slowly, the woman turns. For a moment the King wonders if it's\r\n          his beloved Queen behind the veil. Gently, he lifts her veil.\r\n          It's not his wife, but the most beautiful woman he's ever seen.\r\n\r\n                         RAVENNA\r\n          My name is Ravenna, sire.\r\n          The King is speechless now, gazing upon the face of an angel.\r\n\r\n          ERIC (V.0.)\r\n          So struck by her beauty was the King, that\r\n          he forgot, for the first time, his broken\r\n          heart.\r\n          His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment.\r\n          When she lifts her head --\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n          10a INT.

His\r\n          eyes flicker, as a WOMAN'S SCREAM cuts through the woods.\r\n\r\n                         FLASH TO:\r\n\r\n          THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN\r\n          SARA, beautiful, in pain. A patch of blood blossoms on her\r\n          dress. Her mouth is open, screaming but no sound comes out.\r\n\r\n          BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM\r\n          Eric's eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it\r\n          again.\r\n\r\n          ROSE (O.S.)\r\n          Help!!!!\r\n          He rises to his feet unsteadily, his head pounding from a\r\n          hangover, then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them into\r\n          his harness on his back --\r\n\r\n          23-240MITTED 23-24\r\n\r\n          25 EXT. FOREST - DAY. 25\r\n\r\n          Eric runs past trees and ducks under branches, crashing into a\r\n          few, still drunk. As he arrives at a clearing he sees a\r\n          beautiful girl, (ROSE), fighting off a HUGE TATTOOED WARRIOR,\r\n\r\n          (BROCH).\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          Lay a hand on her and I'll take your head!\r\n          BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised.\r\n\r\n                         BROCH\r\n          Ale given you courage again, huntsman?\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          Won't take much courage to split your skull\r\n          from here.\r\n\r\n                         BROCH\r\n          Aye, but first you'd have to see straight.\r\n          Broch advances with a grin, drawing his own axe. Trying to clear\r\n          his vision and steady his aim, Eric hurls the hatchet -- and\r\n          MISSES, the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened\r\n          Greta's head --\r\n          Broch is on Eric in an instant, swinging his huge battle axe.\r\n          Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows, his natural skill and\r\n          dexterity slowed down by all the ale he's drunk.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            13A\r\n\r\n                         25 CONTINUED: 25\r\n          Rose looks on, terrified, as Broch drives Eric towards the\r\n          trees. He corners him against an oak and swings his axe -- only\r\n          for Eric to duck at the last moment --\r\n          The blade buries itself deep in the tree, stuck. We realize now\r\n          from Eric's dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap. He\r\n          draws his second hatchet, but instead of using the blade, cracks\r\n          Broch over the head with the handle, knocking him out.\r\n          Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through Broch's\r\n          pockets.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            14\r\n\r\n                         25 CONTINUED: (2) 25\r\n\r\n                         ROSE\r\n          Thank you.\r\n          Eric turns. Rose sees how handsome he is. Eric stares at her\r\n          thoughtfully then approaches and gently lifts her chin,\r\n          examining her pretty features. Rose doesn't seem to mind,\r\n          looking back with an inviting smile.\r\n\r\n                         ROSE\r\n          I don't know how to repay you?\r\n          Eric stares at her a moment, then suddenly picks her up and\r\n          tosses her over his shoulders.\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          Don't worry, somebody else will.\r\n\r\n                         26 OMITTED 26\r\n\r\n          27 EXT. VILLAGE - DAY. 27\r\n\r\n          And now we see a RICKETY PRISON WAGON full of BEAUTIFUL GIRLS,\r\n          just like Rose, staring out furiously from behind bars. Eric and\r\n          a SLAVE MERCHANT haggle over Rose who is bound and gagged,\r\n          looking just as furious as the other women.\r\n\r\n                         SLAVE MERCHANT\r\n          Her nose is on the large size and her\r\n          chin's a little weak.\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          Your eyes are dim.\r\n\r\n                         SLAVE MERCHANT\r\n          I'll give you two gold pieces.\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          After all the business we've done\r\n          together?\r\n          Rose curses behind her gag as Eric pulls her away.\r\n\r\n                         SLAVE MERCHANT\r\n          Four gold pieces and that's my final offer!\r\n          Eric doesn't even bother to turn around.\r\n\r\n                         ERIC\r\n          I'll peddle my wares elsewhere, thank\r\n          you.\r\n          The slave merchant sees his prize disappearing and calls out:\r\n\r\n                         SLAVE MERCHANT\r\n          Ten gold pieces!\r\n          Eric hesitates, but it's not from a guilty conscience, he's just\r\n          considering the price. Then he smiles, turns. They have a deal.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           14A\r\n\r\n          28 INT.

A\r\n          regimen. Her hands work precisely as she stacks the wood and\r\n          blows on the kindling.\r\n\r\n                         29 OMITTED 29\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n           15\r\n          29a OMITTED 29a\r\n\r\n          30 INT.

She jumps up gets\r\n          in her bed and pretends to sleep.\r\n          A GUARD opens a cell opposite Snow White. A few seconds\r\n          later the door CLANGS SHUT.\r\n          As soon as the Guard is gone, Snow White rises, walks to her\r\n          cell door and looks down the hall to the other cell.\r\n\r\n                         SNOW WHITE\r\n          Hello?... What's your name?\r\n          Rose, sitting in a dark corner, goes to her cell bars and\r\n          looks out.\r\n\r\n                         ROSE\r\n          I am Rose.\r\n          Snow White smiles - a friendly face.\r\n\r\n          31 INT.

ENDLESS MOOR - AERIAL SHOT - DAY. 49\r\n\r\n          Snow White crests a hill, her mare rearing as she sees -- THE\r\n          DARK FOREST -- A VAST WALL OF PRIMORDIAL TREES. A mist seeps\r\n          from the forest like an evil miasma. Snow white hesitates --\r\n          then sees the riders closing in and urges her mare on --\r\n\r\n          50 EXT. MISTY BOGS/ ENTRANCE TO THE DARK FOREST - DAY. 50\r\n\r\n          Shadows everywhere. The mare charges into the misty bog then\r\n          suddenly loses her footing.

That was your\r\n          question that went unanswered. Sara was\r\n          her name.

I loved\r\n          her more than anything or anyone. And\r\n          then I let her out of my sight and she\r\n          was gone and I became myself again. A\r\n          self I never cared for. Until you. You\r\n          remind me of her. Her spirit. Her\r\n          heart. And now you, too, are gone. You\r\n          both deserved better.

BEACH - DAWN. 189\r\n\r\n          Snow White suddenly sees tiny dots of firelight on the castle\r\n          walls. Eric realizes what they are and rides faster. The\r\n          pinpoints of light soar up in the air, growing larger and\r\n          brighter, until we realize they're FIERY MISSILES. Eric forces\r\n          Snow White's horse out of the way as a fireball explodes yards\r\n          from her.\r\n\r\n                         (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n            92\r\n\r\n                         189 CONTINUED: 189\r\n          Fire rains down on the Duke's army now, panic spreading in the\r\n          ranks.

As William rides on, he sees the\r\n          castle walls through the smoke, the portcullis still down.\r\n\r\n          193 INT.

The clouds move in the disc of light above Snow \r\n           White. The light falls over Ravenna's face. \r\n           The light fades out of her eyes and she dies. \r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n          216 EXT.
