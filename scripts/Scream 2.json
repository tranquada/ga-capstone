She sits\n   down next to...\n   \n   \n   PHIL\n   \n   Who sits with the mask on.

Her face and mind detached from\n   what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching\n   the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.\n   \n   \n   INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE\n   \n   Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat\n   when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...\n   knowingly... she reaches for it.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Hello?\n   \n                       MAN'S VOICE\n             Hello Sidney?\n   \n   The VOICE.

The one from\n   Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer\n   archway, staring at her.\n   \n   A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.\n   But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,\n   steel hunting knife... blood stained.\n   \n   \n   SIDNEY BOLTS\n   \n   As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,\n   \n   \n   ON THE PORCH\n   \n   Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He\n   finds it locked.

She bolts through the living room, to the front\n   door. Derek beats on it from outside.\n   \n   \n   IN THE FOYER\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Derek. He's in the house. Help...\n             me...\n   \n   She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,\n   the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,\n   thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.\n   \n   \n   INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE\n   \n   Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He\n   moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.\n   He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the\n   kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot\n   back and kicks in the window.\n   \n   \n   INT. KITCHEN - SAME\n   \n   Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She\n   struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind\n   her. She barely makes it out the back door...\n   \n   \n   EXT. BACK YARD - SAME\n   \n   A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid\n   flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves\n   across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed\n   fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind\n   her to find...\n   \n   \n   NOTHING\n   \n   She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely\n   disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind\n   it.\n   \n   Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind\n   the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for\n   the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.\n   \n   BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still\n   making her way around the tree, moving backwards,\n   walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning\n   around, finding herself face to face with...\n   \n   \n   CICI'S BODY\n   \n   Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a\n   ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE\n   HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms\n   of...\n   \n   \n   DEWEY\n   \n   She turns, SCREAMING.\n   \n                       DEWEY\n             It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.\n   \n   He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she\n   holds on for dear life.\n   \n   \n   EXT.

UNIFORMS\n   and SUITS swarm the place.\n   \n   In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and\n   Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean\n   Fisher. Tempers are heated.

Her two police\n   guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye\n   out.\n   \n   \n   CLOSE ON SIDNEY\n   \n   Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the\n   computer screen in front of her.\n   \n   \n   ON THE MONITOR\n   \n   Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts\n   flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words.\n   \n   \n   ON SIDNEY\n   \n   Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't.

A message pops\n   up on the screen.\n   \n   \"YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT.\"\n   \n   Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking\n   about the crowded room. He could be anywhere. The two\n   guards take notice, rushing over to her.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             He's here. He's in the room right\n             now.\n   \n   She points to the screen. The men instantly break up\n   and cover the room. They start pulling people from\n   their terminals to check their screens.\n   \n   Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing.\n   \n   Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She\n   looks around. She slowly moves toward it, drawn\n   uncontrollably. She hits ALT + M. Another message pops\n   up:\n   \n   \"THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU.\"\n   \n   \n   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE\n   \n   It's stone pale.

Two hands reach in and yank\n   Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but\n   it's cut short.\n   \n   Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel\n   struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a\n   Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car\n   towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too\n   late. The Ghost has the door open.\n   \n   A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is\n   slit.\n   \n   \n   IN THE BACK SEAT\n   \n   Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the\n   car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.\n   \n   \n   IN THE FRONT SEAT\n   \n   The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then\n   gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the\n   car in drive and takes off down the road.\n   \n   Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay\n   sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the\n   door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,\n   and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.\n   \n   \n   EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME\n   \n   The car makes its way down the deserted street\n   \n   \n   IN THE BACKSEAT\n   \n   Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through\n   the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.\n   Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.\n   She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes\n   by.\n   \n   Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another\n   campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each\n   side of a thin, road.\n   \n   She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The\n   white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The\n   Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.\n   \n   Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.\n   She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She\n   pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow\n   No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal\n   grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck\n   is right up against it.\n   \n   Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the\n   Ghost's head, ready to attack.\n   \n   Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,\n   into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost\n   falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for\n   a moment.\n   \n   The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.\n   The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to\n   bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post\n   that stands directly in the car's path.\n   \n   The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,\n   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,\n   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.\n   \n   Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal\n   rumbling.\n   \n   \n   INSIDE THE CAR\n   \n   All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the\n   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked\n   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.\n   \n   Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,\n   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It\n   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the\n   car. It's flush against the building.\n   \n   Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been\n   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,\n   pulling on it, bending it backwards...\n   \n   CREAK!\n   \n   Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while\n   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates\n   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She\n   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...\n   \n   \n   FRONT SEAT\n   \n   Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving\n   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed\n   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED\n   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His\n   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.\n   \n   The only way out is through the driver's door.\n   \n   After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over\n   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.\n   Nothing.\n   \n   She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to\n   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the\n   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against\n   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass\n   through.\n   \n   She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her\n   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans\n   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching\n   for the door knob.\n   \n   HONK!\n   \n   Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face\n   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He\n   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the\n   car door open and starts to slide completely over the\n   Ghost when she stops.\n   \n   She looks to the Ghost.\n   \n   \n   CLOSE ON HER FACE\n   \n   As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce\n   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She\n   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away\n   when...\n   \n   \n   THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE\n   \n   Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out\n   the car door.\n   \n   \n   OUTSIDE THE CAR\n   \n   BAM!\n   \n   Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when\n   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.\n   \n   The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into\n   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She\n   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.\n   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,\n   knocking him backwards.\n   \n   Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the\n   pavement.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   EXT.

And then FOOTSTEPS are\n   heard, making their way towards her.\n   \n   Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a\n   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...\n   \n   \n   GHOST FIGURE\n   \n   That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.\n   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the\n   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,\n   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost\n   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears\n   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying\n   to secure it. There's no lock.\n   \n   \n   AT THE MAIN DOOR\n   \n   Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be\n   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he\n   immediately spots Gale.\n   \n   \n   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM\n   \n   Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She\n   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.\n   \n   \n   OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM\n   \n   Dewey moves to the window.\n   \n                       DEWEY\n             Gale! Gale!\n   \n   She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS\n   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.\n   \n   \n   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM\n   \n   Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,\n   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the\n   sound proof barrier behind her.\n   \n   She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind\n   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.\n   \n   \n   INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE\n   \n   Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is\n   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see\n   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled\n   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is\n   splattered against the glass.\n   \n   \n   IN THE CONTROL BOOTH\n   \n   Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off\n   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.\n   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios\n   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.\n   \n   \n   IN THE DUBBING STAGE\n   \n   Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.\n   \n   Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed\n   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves\n   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment\n   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes\n   reveal it.\n   \n   Gale BEATS against the glass window.\n   \n                       GALE\n                   (through tears)\n             NOOOOOOO!\n   \n   Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is\n   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made\n   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.\n   She races to the door, throws the things away.\n   \n   She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide\n   through. And she's off and running.\n   \n   Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only\n   long enough to lock it.\n   \n   BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it\n   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a\n   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through\n   it and out into...\n   \n   \n   THE HALLWAY\n   \n   Gale shoots down it.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER\n   \n   Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in\n   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and\n   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out\n   onto...\n   \n   \n   EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME\n   \n   The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta\n   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.\n   Sid goes for it.\n   \n   \n   EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME\n   \n   Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the\n   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!\n   \n   Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound\n   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody\n   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A\n   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,\n   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.\n   \n   Sid runs to them.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Oh God, help me. We have to call\n             the police.\n   \n   Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open\n   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has\n   no comprehension skills at all.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Do you have keys? I need to get\n             inside.\n   \n   Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Shit!\n   \n   Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves\n   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back\n   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's\n   locked too.\n   \n   Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots\n   a big tree with a...\n   \n   BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She\n   moves toward it.\n   \n   As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He\n   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still\n   chained to the tree.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Mickey? Mickey?\n   \n   A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there\n   very much dead.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Oh God, no, Mickey...\n   \n   She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,\n   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried\n   funk, his eyes wide.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've\n             been here all night.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Listen to me. We've got to get\n             help. The Killer's here.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             What are you talking about?\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             He's after me.\n   \n   Mickey pulls on his chained arm.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             Shit! You've got to cut me down,\n             Sid.\n   \n   Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             I'll be right back.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             Where you going?\n   \n   Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.\n   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid\n   settles on a shovel.\n   \n   Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's\n   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Watch out.\n   \n   Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on\n   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             Do it again.\n   \n   CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around\n   peering into the night.\n   \n                       MICKEY (CONT'D)\n             What was that?\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Don't panic.\n   \n   Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings\n   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening\n   it.\n   \n   Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Watch out.\n   \n   Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't\n   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the\n   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and\n   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.\n   \n   Mickey looks up, just in time.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             SIDNEYWATCHOUT!\n   \n   Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.\n   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,\n   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.\n   \n   Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,\n   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.\n   \n   The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Hey.\n   \n   Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost\n   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting\n   across the yard, running smack into...\n   \n   \n   THE GHOST MASKED KILLER\n   \n   But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each\n   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two\n   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but\n   they counter, keeping her surrounded.\n   \n   Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.\n   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.\n   They close in on her, ready to strike.\n   \n   She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!\n   \n   Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the\n   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.\n   \n                       MICKEY\n             Run, Sid...\n   \n   Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards\n   the front of the yard.\n   \n   Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.\n   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't\n   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.\n   \n   Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...\n   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around\n   just in time to see...\n   \n   Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're\n   knives strike at the same time. One through the\n   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw\n   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily\n   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the\n   ground.\n   \n   Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off\n   running, along the side of the house, through a row of\n   shrub that take her to...\n   \n   \n   EXT. STREET - SAME\n   \n   Sid is back on the campus street, running down the\n   middle of it.\n   \n   She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.\n   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and\n   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet\n   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the\n   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.\n   \n   She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The\n   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone\n   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Hallie?\n   \n   But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.\n   \n                                               CUT TO:\n   \n   \n   EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER\n   \n   Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an\n   emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She\n   goes for it.\n   \n   Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL\n   button.\n   \n                       VOICE\n                   (from phone)\n             What is your emergency please?\n   \n                       GALE\n             Someone's trying to kill me.

She\n   looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side\n   theatre door.\n   \n                       GALE\n             SIDNEY!\n   \n   But Sidney has already disappeared inside.

THEATRE SAME\n   \n   The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge\n   proscenium stage.\n   \n   Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on\n   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way\n   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             Hello?\n   \n   The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the\n   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from\n   the stage wings.\n   \n                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)\n             Hallie?\n   \n   Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that\n   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and\n   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either\n   side of her.\n   \n   Complete darkness.\n   \n   DRIP! DRIP!\n   \n   Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She\n   wipes it from her face when...\n   \n   CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the\n   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at\n   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in\n   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is\n   blinding.\n   \n   CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid\n   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She\n   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.\n   \n   The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back\n   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and\n   antique weapons and...\n   \n   \n   DEWEY\n   \n   Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very\n   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a\n   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen\n   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.\n   She breaks into tears. And then...\n   \n   Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when\n   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,\n   trapping her. She looks in shock at...\n   \n   \n   HALLIE\n   \n   Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,\n   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a\n   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled\n   set of DEATHTRAP.\n   \n   Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood\n   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...\n   \n   CLAPPING!\n   \n   A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...\n   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving\n   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.\n   \n   Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near\n   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to\n   find...\n   \n   \n   COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME\n   \n   Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.\n   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his\n   arms and legs bound by electric tape.\n   \n   Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is\n   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a\n   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.\n   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with\n   pleading eyes.\n   \n                       COTTON\n             Quick, untie me.\n   \n   Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans\n   down to untie him but stops.\n   \n                       VOICE\n                   (from behind video\n                   camera)\n             You've seen this movie before,\n             haven't you?\n   \n   Sidney looks to the voice.

Hmmm?\n   \n   Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching\n   out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find\n   Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES.

Murder in his eye.\n   \n                       COTTON\n             I get my revenge and make some fast\n             cash.\n   \n                       SIDNEY\n             It's over, Cotton.\n   \n                       COTTON\n             Not until you're dead.\n   \n   Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through\n   the set door to...\n   \n   \n   BACKSTAGE\n   \n   Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the\n   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back\n   wail. She races down it.\n   \n   She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE\n   SCRIM!\n   \n   Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage\n   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder\n   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk\n   above.\n   \n   Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with\n   lightning speed.\n   \n   Cotton, up and running, is close behind.\n   \n   \n   INT. CATWALK SAME\n   \n   The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats\n   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.\n   \n   Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the\n   ending.\n   \n   AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.\n   \n   WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE\n   CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY\n   RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND\n   STABS COTTON.\n   \n   HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH\n   OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT\n   TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY\n   CLOSE.\n   \n   \n   \n   THE END (FOR NOW)\n\n\t\n\n\n\nScream 2\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kevin Williamson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:42.028315"}
