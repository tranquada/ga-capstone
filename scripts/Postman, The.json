Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he\n    carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten,\n    history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.\n\n    His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered\n    sign: \"The Great Salt Lake Marina.\" They start down a\n    slope and begin to cross a...\n\n\n<b>    DRY LAKE BED\n</b>\n    A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee-\n    to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the\n    plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house\n    boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.\n\n<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n</b>               The last of the great cities died\n               when my father was a child.\n               Another victim of yet another war.\n               The plagues followed. And the\n               terrors. The living hid\n               themselves away in tiny hamlets in\n               hopes of surviving whatever new\n               madness conspired to rob them of\n               the little that remained. The\n               Earth itself had fallen prey to\n               chaos. For three years a dirty\n               snow fell that even summer could\n               not erase. The ocean was barren.\n               Poisoned. Near death.\n\n    As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.\n    He's soon lost in the massive vista.\n\n<b>                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n</b>               Sixteen long years passed before\n               the great lungs started working\n               again. My father said it was as\n               if the ocean breathed a great sigh\n               of relief...\n\n    A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just\n    sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run.\n    Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these\n    boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.\n\n<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                           3.\n</b>\n<b>1   CONTINUED:                                                   1\n</b>\n    TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the\n    sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of\n    depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --\n\n\n<b>    MAN'S FOOTPRINTS\n</b>\n    These tracks may already be days old as they fill with\n    rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS.\n    A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big\n    cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low,\n    disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner\n    plans -- for now.\n\n\n<b>2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2\n</b>\n    A bullet-ridden sign reads: \"U.S. 84 North.\" The Postman\n    leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through\n    the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the\n    median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The\n    Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole\n    and continues.\n\n    BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 I don't know.

He\n    references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon\n    through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a\n    Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                            4.\n</b>\n<b>4   EXT.

There's a stripped\n    fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo\n    foundation which bristles with burned timbers.\n\n    Bill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at\n    him with his hat.\n\n<b>                            THE POSTMAN\n</b>              Damnit, Bill, you know I need to\n              check it first!\n\n    Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack.\n    He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its\n    contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several\n    small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops\n    from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny\n    strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid\n    purple. The Postman is dubious.\n\n<b>                            THE POSTMAN\n</b>              Better than turpentine.\n                     (touches some\n                      to his lips)\n              Tastes about the same. Your call,\n              Bill.\n\n    Bill drinks.\n\n<b>                            THE POSTMAN\n</b>              You ain't picky, Bill. I like\n              that about you.\n\n    The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and\n    crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the\n    ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree\n    bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.\n    Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the\n    20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color\n    before.\n\n    The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling\n    ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.\n\n\n<b>5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5\n</b>\n    A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds\n    a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.\n\n<b>                                                   (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                              5.\n</b>\n<b>5   CONTINUED:                                                      5\n</b>\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 'Running on Empty'?

The Postman smiles.\n\n<b>                                THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147\n                 channels. Everything from Jesus\n                 to 'Jeopardy'.\n\n    He steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but\n    The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static,\n    then:\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 'Like sands through the hour-\n                 glass, so are the days of our\n                 lives...'\n                        (switching channels)\n                 'Michael Shields, come on down,\n                 you're the next contestant\n                 on...'The Price is Right'.'\n                        (switching again)\n                 I'll take Domestic Nuclear\n                 Disasters for two hundred\n                 thousand, Alex...\n\n    The Postman stops suddenly.

Well, shit.\n\n    The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's\n    a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service\n    manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the\n    carbine.\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 I don't want any trouble... I bet\n                 you don't either...

Scared, it bounds back\n    and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.\n    The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 Look out, Bill!\n\n<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                               6.\n</b>\n<b>5   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               5\n</b>\n    The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.\n    Bill has a conniption fit.\n\n    Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette\n    machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are\n    empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's\n    intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the\n    machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.\n\n    The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of\n    cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 I'm rich.\n\n\n<b>6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6\n</b>\n    Embers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the\n    carbine in reach.\n\n    BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman\n    reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a\n    shotgun pointed in his face.\n\n    Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is\n    mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a\n    shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks\n    the carbine out of reach.\n\n<b>                               THE POSTMAN\n</b>                 I'm just passing through.

The Postman tries\n     the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep\n     is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly\n     smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider-\n     webbed safety glass and climbs inside.\n\n\n<b>     JEEP\n</b>\n     Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the\n     skeleton, like two kids about to \"park\" for the first\n     time.\n\n<b>                                 THE POSTMAN\n</b>                  Hey.

Oddly\n     respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the\n     \"Horse &amp; Rider\" emblem.\n\n     The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag\n     patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver.\n     A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket\n     off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside.\n\n     A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket.

He passes a 7-11\n     converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered\n     to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going\n     to make it out of here after all.

But before it clears the\n      scabbard, The Postman lunges.\n\n      The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the\n      ground hard.\n\n      Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a\n      better look.\n\n      The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem\n      are at each other like coiled snakes.\n\n      It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists --\n      especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in\n      tighter.\n\n      Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they\n      fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.\n\n      One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his\n      footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock\n      with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.\n\n      It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the\n      fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --\n      grabs The Postman's throat with the other.\n\n<b>                                 BETHLEHEM\n</b>                   I study people.

That's\n                   what makes me better.\n\n      The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his\n      remaining strength to keep him at bay.\n\n<b>                                 THE POSTMAN\n</b>                          (barely audible)\n                   I believe in the United States\n                   Postal Service.\n\n<b>                                                       (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                 134.\n</b>\n<b>165   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 165\n</b>\n      The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt\n      and pulls him over.

The Postman pounces on\n      top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to\n      pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to\n      die.\n\n      The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists.\n      Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the\n      faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps\n      for breath.\n\n      As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The\n      Postman looks to both sides.\n\n<b>                                 THE POSTMAN\n</b>                   It doesn't have to be this way.\n                   We don't have to kill each other.\n                   We can live together.
