DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1\n\n    Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear\n    PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer\n    appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he\n    carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten,\n    history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.\n\n    His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered\n    sign: \"The Great Salt Lake Marina.\" They start down a\n    slope and begin to cross a...\n\n\n    DRY LAKE BED\n\n    A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee-\n    to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the\n    plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house\n    boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.\n\n                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n               The last of the great cities died\n               when my father was a child.\n               Another victim of yet another war.\n               The plagues followed. And the\n               terrors. The living hid\n               themselves away in tiny hamlets in\n               hopes of surviving whatever new\n               madness conspired to rob them of\n               the little that remained. The\n               Earth itself had fallen prey to\n               chaos. For three years a dirty\n               snow fell that even summer could\n               not erase. The ocean was barren.\n               Poisoned. Near death.\n\n    As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.\n    He's soon lost in the massive vista.\n\n                             WOMAN (V.O.)\n               Sixteen long years passed before\n               the great lungs started working\n               again. My father said it was as\n               if the ocean breathed a great sigh\n               of relief...\n\n    A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just\n    sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run.\n    Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these\n    boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           3.\n\n1   CONTINUED:                                                   1\n\n    TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the\n    sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of\n    depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --\n\n\n    MAN'S FOOTPRINTS\n\n    These tracks may already be days old as they fill with\n    rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS.\n    A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big\n    cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low,\n    disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner\n    plans -- for now.\n\n\n2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2\n\n    A bullet-ridden sign reads: \"U.S. 84 North.\" The Postman\n    leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through\n    the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the\n    median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The\n    Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole\n    and continues.\n\n    BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 I don't know. And if you ask me\n                 again, I'm going to slug you.\n\n    They near a sign: \"Thank You For Visiting Utah.\" The\n    Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 It's been fun, hasn't it, kids?\n                        (to the sign)\n                 You're welcome!\n\n\n3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3\n\n    Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder\n    on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.\n\n    Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He\n    references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon\n    through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a\n    Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.\n\n                                                            4.\n\n4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4\n\n    A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's.\n    Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule.\n    Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped\n    fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo\n    foundation which bristles with burned timbers.\n\n    Bill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at\n    him with his hat.\n\n                            THE POSTMAN\n              Damnit, Bill, you know I need to\n              check it first!\n\n    Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack.\n    He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its\n    contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several\n    small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops\n    from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny\n    strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid\n    purple. The Postman is dubious.\n\n                            THE POSTMAN\n              Better than turpentine.\n                     (touches some\n                      to his lips)\n              Tastes about the same. Your call,\n              Bill.\n\n    Bill drinks.\n\n                            THE POSTMAN\n              You ain't picky, Bill. I like\n              that about you.\n\n    The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and\n    crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the\n    ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree\n    bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.\n    Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the\n    20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color\n    before.\n\n    The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling\n    ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.\n\n\n5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5\n\n    A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds\n    a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              5.\n\n5   CONTINUED:                                                      5\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 'Running on Empty'? Tell me about\n                 it.\n\n    Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of\n    trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                 Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147\n                 channels. Everything from Jesus\n                 to 'Jeopardy'.\n\n    He steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but\n    The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static,\n    then:\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 'Like sands through the hour-\n                 glass, so are the days of our\n                 lives...'\n                        (switching channels)\n                 'Michael Shields, come on down,\n                 you're the next contestant\n                 on...'The Price is Right'.'\n                        (switching again)\n                 I'll take Domestic Nuclear\n                 Disasters for two hundred\n                 thousand, Alex...\n\n    The Postman stops suddenly.    Click.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 We interrupt our regularly\n                 scheduled program to bring you the\n                 Second Civil War... Well, shit.\n\n    The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's\n    a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service\n    manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the\n    carbine.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 I don't want any trouble... I bet\n                 you don't either... Let's just\n                 call it a draw, okay?\n\n    Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe\n    dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back\n    and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.\n    The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 Look out, Bill!\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               6.\n\n5   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               5\n\n    The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.\n    Bill has a conniption fit.\n\n    Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette\n    machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are\n    empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's\n    intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the\n    machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.\n\n    The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of\n    cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 I'm rich.\n\n\n6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6\n\n    Embers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the\n    carbine in reach.\n\n    BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman\n    reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a\n    shotgun pointed in his face.\n\n    Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is\n    mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a\n    shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks\n    the carbine out of reach.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 I'm just passing through. I don't\n                 mean anyone any harm.\n                        (re: stream)\n                 Water's good.\n\n    The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the\n    muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 I'm not a Holnist.\n\n    The Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens\n    his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 Okay?\n\n    They just stare at him, none saying a word.

I\n                 got my stuff bolted in.\n\n\n    BANDITS\n\n    The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.\n\n                               LEAD BANDIT\n                 Put some buckshot through it,\n                 Martin. Just to hurry him up.\n\n                               HULKING BANDIT\n                 I only got three shells left.\n\n                               LEAD BANDIT\n                 So use his gun.\n\n    The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK.\n    It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside,\n    pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.\n\n\n    76 BALL\n\n    Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball,\n    trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't\n    budge.\n\n\n    LADDER\n\n    The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.\n\n\n    76 BALL\n\n    No good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole.\n\n\n    LADDER\n\n    The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the\n    rocking motion. Hangs on.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                          10.\n\n8   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            8\n\n    76 BALL\n\n    Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that\n    instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The\n    rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in\n    place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before\n    going with the pole's tilt.\n\n\n    LADDER\n\n    The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking\n    Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other\n    Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.\n\n\n    THE POSTMAN\n\n    whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.\n\n\n    FIELD\n\n    The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a\n    stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts\n    apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his\n    feet.\n\n                               THE POSTMAN\n                 Bill!\n\n    Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the\n    RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.\n\n    Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before\n    a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.\n    Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge,\n    quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.\n\n    Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over\n    Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit\n    aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.\n\n    He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the\n    SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and\n    he's laughing like a hyena!\n\n                               BANDIT #20\n                 We're rich!\n\n                                                            11.\n\n9    EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY                             9\n\n     The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the\n     mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument.\n\n                             THE POSTMAN\n               It's true, we haven't done this in\n               a while, but it's like riding a\n               bicycle. Now, open your mouth.\n\n     The Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he\n     tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look.\n     BILL BRAYS.\n\n                             THE POSTMAN\n               I know the rule. It's my rule!\n               Avoid civilization at all costs.\n               But we gotta eat, don't we?\n                      (as BILL BRAYS again)\n               What are you so worried about,\n               Bill? All you gotta do is stand\n               there. I'm the one with all the\n               lines.\n\n     The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town\n     far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL\n     BRAYS in protest.\n\n\n10   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY                            10\n\n     A patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty\n     townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman\n     wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a\n     mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children\n     especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY,\n     lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman\n     with inscrutable intensity.\n\n                             THE POSTMAN\n               They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth,\n               'til Birnam Wood comes to\n               Dunsinane'!\n\n     He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears.\n\n                             THE POSTMAN\n               I said, Birnam Wood comes to\n               Dunsinane!\n\n     Bill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam\n     Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight.\n     The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              12.\n\n10   CONTINUED:                                                     10\n\n     The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going\n     well.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Arm, arm yourselves!

The two of them dash back and forth pretending to\n     fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks\n     out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the\n                  day after that. Out brief candle!\n                  Life's but a walking shadow, a\n                  poor player that struts his hour\n                  upon the stage and is heard no\n                  more. It's a tale told by a\n                  moron. Full of sound and fury,\n                  signifying nothing.\n                         (waves sword)\n                  But blow, wind! Come wrack!

Even Bill does a\n     cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the\n     stage to many hearty handshakes.\n\n     Woody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the\n     town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety\n     old CURMUDGEON LARRY.\n\n                                MRS.

But you had time for a\n                  play?\n\n     Head down, The Postman makes for \"the back way.\" But it's\n     guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers. No getting by\n     them. The Postman does a quick 180, goes back the way he\n     came.\n\n     Bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk.\n\n                                BETHLEHEM\n                  I'm taking three conscripts from\n                  each town.

Some of the\n     Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way\n     toward the open courtyard and, ultimately, the gate out of\n     town.\n\n     Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem.

Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking\n     no more notice of The Postman than anyone else.\n\n                             BETHLEHEM\n               The laws of eight, gentlemen.\n               That is the legacy handed down to\n               us by Nathan Holn.\n\n     At the mention of this name, the RECRUITS shout as one.\n\n                             RECRUITS\n               God rest his soul!\n\n                             THE POSTMAN\n                      (low)\n               May he burn in hell.\n\n     Getty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman\n     swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away.\n     He's not going to bust him on it.\n\n                             BETHLEHEM\n               These are the laws that we live\n               by. The eight is our symbol.\n               Each man will bear it with pride.\n\n     Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to\n     reveal the branded 8.\n\n                             BETHLEHEM\n               Only then will you be part of the\n               clan. Sit down, gentlemen.\n\n     The men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then\n     does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17\n     chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't\n     take him long to realize that he's in trouble.\n\n                             BETHLEHEM\n               Law One. You will obey orders\n               without question.\n                      (to Slow Recruit)\n               I told you to sit.\n\n                             SLOW RECRUIT\n                      (scared)\n               There weren't enough chairs.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 24.\n\n14   CONTINUED:                                                        14\n\n                                BETHLEHEM\n                  I didn't specify chairs. You\n                  could've sat down on the ground.\n\n     The Slow Recruit moves to do so.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                  You disobeyed a direct order.    You\n                  broke Law One.\n\n     Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                  Law Two.   Punishment shall be\n                  swift.\n\n     They hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a\n     coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly\n     slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him\n     upside down into the air.\n\n                                BETHLEHEM\n                  Law Three: Mercy is for the weak.\n                  Four: Terror will defeat reason.\n                  Five: Your allegiance is to the\n                  clan. Six: Justice can be\n                  dictated. Law Seven. Any\n                  clansman may challenge for\n                  leadership of the clan. Does any\n                  man here wish to challenge me?\n\n     There are no takers.\n\n                                  BETHLEHEM\n                  On your feet!\n\n     The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open.\n\n     Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out\n     and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds.\n     Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists\n     around.\n\n                               BETHLEHEM\n                  Law Eight: There is only one\n                  penalty: Death.\n\n     Bethlehem raises the sword.\n\n                                SLOW RECRUIT\n                  Please, I'm begging you.\n\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 25.\n\n14   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 14\n\n     THE POSTMAN\n\n     As the sword finds its mark.     Bethlehem looks at him, but\n     addresses all.\n\n                                BETHLEHEM\n                  You will get out of this army what\n                  you put into it. Work and you'll\n                  be fed. Fight and you'll be\n                  respected. Die and you'll be\n                  remembered. It's up to you.\n\n     Bethlehem turns and walks away.     Getty following behind.\n     The Postman watches as they go.     Idaho steps up to him.\n\n                                IDAHO\n                  You thinking of challenging for\n                  leadership of the clan?\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                  No, sir.   I'm a follower not a\n                  leader.\n\n                                IDAHO\n                  You see Colonel Getty? Always\n                  following the General? He's the\n                  only man who ever challenged.\n                  Fight lasted six seconds, but the\n                  General didn't kill him. He cut\n                  off his tongue and he cut off his\n                  balls and old Getty's been\n                  following him like a dog ever\n                  since.\n\n     The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty\n     disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this\n     affects a new man.\n\n     The Postman moves on.     Idaho stops Woody as he passes.\n\n                                IDAHO\n                  The General don't see it, but I\n                  say you got some nigger in you.\n\n     Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer.\n\n\n15   EXT. PLAINS - DAY                                                 15\n\n     Rain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War\n     wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an\n     old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The\n     conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy\n     pack.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               26.\n\n15   CONTINUED:                                                      15\n\n     Marching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead.\n     The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs,\n     catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line.\n\n                                IDAHO\n                  The General would like a word with\n                  you, Shakespeare.\n\n\n16   INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY                             16\n\n     Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in\n     hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his\n     reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition\n     of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure.\n\n     He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in.\n     Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman\n     doesn't quite know what to do.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                         (re: the book and\n                          binoculars on the\n                          table)\n                  They're yours. A solitary man,\n                  aren't you? Binoculars. To watch\n                  life from a distance. And\n                  Shakespeare. To read about it\n                  instead of living it.\n\n     Bethlehem wants an answer.    The Postman clears his throat.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  No offense, General, but you seem\n                  to have read some Shakespeare\n                  yourself.\n\n                                BETHLEHEM\n                  If he wishes to rise above mere\n                  thuggery, a military commandeer\n                  must be classically educated.\n                  Philosophy, history.

Do you think I was in the\n                  army? I sold copying machines. I\n                  was a salesman. The talent to\n                  lead men and devise and execute a\n                  battle plan were locked away\n                  inside me.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              27.\n\n16   CONTINUED:                                                     16\n\n     He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.

Bethlehem goes back to his painting. He\n     considers himself in the mirror.

Across the way, he\n     sees Bandit #20 talking to Getty. Getty glances at The\n     Postman who returns to work, watches under his eyebrows as\n     Idaho joins the group. There's trouble brewing here.\n\n     Worried, The Postman looks to Woody, who watches the\n     exchange as well. He is, as usual, inscrutable.\n\n\n19   EXT. CLEARING - RIVER - DAY                                      19\n\n     The river is swollen and swift from the spring thaw.\n     Marching along the east ridge above it, the army is given\n     the order to halt.\n\n     The Postman looks ahead to where Idaho confers with\n     Bethlehem. Something's wrong. They look to where:\n\n     Two carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a\n     thicket across the river. A rotten wood and rope bridge\n     spans the space between the ridges.\n\n     Idaho rides to the conscripts:\n\n                             IDAHO\n               One of you dogs has earned himself\n               a treat.

Pulling himself\n     out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He\n     disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear.\n\n     They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see\n     footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself\n     out. They start after him.\n\n\n24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24\n\n     Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman\n     stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past.\n\n     Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the\n     clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the\n     trees. They look at each other for a moment.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Just let me go.

A shadow falls over him.\n     It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear\n     others approaching from the river.\n\n                                WOODY\n                  They sent me to kill you.\n\n                                  THE POSTMAN\n                  Come with me.\n\n     At that moment, Idaho and the second soldier come into the\n     clearing.

The THIRD ROUND finds his heart, puts Woody down.\n     Dead. But not before he lands on top of Idaho.\n\n     As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woody's massive\n     frame, The Postman heads for the trees.\n\n\n     Covered in Woody's blood, Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The\n     Postman disappears into the woods.

Smiling,\n     hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING.   Just\n     ahead.

Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings,\n     nothing's been down here in years.\n\n     Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked,\n     The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth\n     back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks\n     his body.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               35.\n\n26   CONTINUED:                                                      26\n\n     He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's\n     made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't\n     find some shelter.\n\n     An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road.    Square.   He\n     cautiously pulls back a few branches.\n\n     An old, rusted Jeep with faded    U.S. government markings.\n     Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide. The\n     Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window,\n     comes face-to-face with death.     A skeleton sits inside,\n     the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman.\n\n\n     But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The\n     two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected\n     on the glass, superimposed over the skull.\n\n     A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries\n     the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep\n     is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly\n     smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider-\n     webbed safety glass and climbs inside.\n\n\n     JEEP\n\n     Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the\n     skeleton, like two kids about to \"park\" for the first\n     time.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                  Hey.   How ya doin'?\n\n     The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail.\n     The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly\n     respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the\n     \"Horse & Rider\" emblem.\n\n     The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag\n     patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver.\n     A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket\n     off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside.\n\n     A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a\n     liquor. He gives the skeleton a \"you shouldn't have\"\n     look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs\n     the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He\n     takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down\n     his throat.\n\n     The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            36.\n\n26   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            26\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  'Jerry Ball, Pine View.'\n\n     He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                  So, arrest me.\n                         (reading)\n                  Here's a piece of good news.\n                  Jerry's decided to go to school to\n                  get his contractor's license.\n\n     Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another.

A tiny\n     tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly\n     isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope.\n\n     Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back.\n     Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself\n     with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he\n     regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF.\n\n\n27   EXT.

They\n     talk excitedly amongst themselves, break into spontaneous\n     applause as Ford and The Postman enter.\n\n     The Postman is surprised, uncomfortable at this display.\n     But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the\n     counter.

The Postman sits behind four empty bowls.\n     People watch him eat like it was a religious experience.\n     He pushes back the fifth bowl.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Never thought I'd hear myself say\n                  this, but I can't eat anymore.\n\n     He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.

Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her\n     son away.\n\n     The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman\n     we saw at the Pine View gates.

He passes a 7-11\n     converted to a blacksmith shop. There's a horse tethered\n     to the railing in front of it. He grins; maybe he's going\n     to make it out of here after all.

Only\n                  another postman can make you a\n                  postman.\n\n                                FORD\n                  Kinda like vampires, right?\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Something like that. You have to\n                  be sworn in.\n\n     Ford raises his right hand, palm out, ready to take the\n     oath. It takes The Postman a moment to realize.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  The organization's kinda shaky.\n                  It might not last.\n\n                                FORD\n                  What does?\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  You'd meet a lot of people who\n                  don't believe in you.\n\n                                FORD\n                  I'll set them straight.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  It's a lonely job.\n\n                                FORD\n                  I've been lonely all my life.\n\n     This response strikes a chord. The Postman sees how badly\n     Ford wants something to hold onto. He sees himself.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  So have I, Ford.

The Postman doesn't realize, but this\n     is the most important moment in Ford's life.\n\n                                FORD\n                  I want you to know I'd die to get\n                  a letter through.\n\n     Ford's intensity takes The Postman back.

He pushes open the door,\n     knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved\n     under the door. He gathers them up, flips through them.\n     They're written on scraps, the backs of pictures, on\n     handkerchiefs and homemade paper. They aren't old.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                53.\n\n39   CONTINUED:                                                       39\n\n     They're brand new.      Shaking his head, he closes the door.\n\n     The Postman has no sooner done so when there's a KNOCK on\n     the window. He looks over at a woman. She shrugs,\n     smiles, holds up a letter. The Postman sighs; he's\n     trapped in here.\n\n\n40   EXT.

He's home.\n\n\n     ON FORD\n\n     Concentrating, Ford holds a needle and thread and a piece\n     of cloth on which he's drawn an approximation of the post\n     office shoulder patch. By moonlight he embroiders it in.\n     Not exactly work you'd pay money for, but not bad either.\n\n\n41   INT.

He laces his fingers behind his head, stares up\n     at the moon through a hole in the wall. A KNOCK at the\n     door.\n\n                                   THE POSTMAN\n                  Just leave it.\n\n     There's a pause.

The Postman looks out at the crowd. They\n     crave hope. He should probably just keep his mouth shut.\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                  Times seem hard right now. But\n                  you have to believe it's getting\n                  better. Birds are migrating\n                  again. The rains are back.\n\n     The people consider him and then each other. By God, they\n     do feel hopeful. Suddenly, Ellen, her little boy by her\n     side, begins to sing. It's weak at first, but one-by-one\n     the others join in. Soon the whole town is singing:\n\n                                ELLEN & TOWN\n                  'Oh beautiful for spacious skies,\n                  for amber waves of grain.

They sing their hearts out.\n     The guilt is overwhelming. He digs his heels into the\n     horse's flanks and rides out of town.\n\n                                                           57.\n\n44   EXT.

Caught in an inner turmoil,\n     Briscoe reaches into his pocket, and pulls out a letter.\n     He turns it over in his hands, looks off at The Postman.\n\n                              BRISCOE\n               God damn it!\n\n     Briscoe urges his horse forward, catches up. He hands The\n     Postman the letter, then rides back for town. The Postman\n     watches Briscoe. The people lining the wall. And he\n     realizes just what effect he's had. There's nothing to\n     do, but shrug his shoulders and ride. Strains of\n     \"AMERICA\" still ECHO hauntingly OVER:\n\n\n45   EXT. ON ROAD - SUN                                           45\n\n     A green and lavender sunset. In the middle of nowhere,\n     The Postman rides, chewing a piece of jerked beef. He\n     flips through some of the letters entrusted to him.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              58.\n\n45   CONTINUED:                                                     45\n\n                                   THE POSTMAN\n                  Eugene.

Smiling, The Postman shoves the\n     envelope into his bag. As he does, he finds something\n     else. The red ribbon. He runs it through his fingers,\n     thinks wistfully of Abby. Then, like a knight of old\n     representing a lady's honor, he ties it to his mailbag and\n     rides on.\n\n\n46   EXT.

Michael leans against a tree, watches Abby\n     at work until she notices him. She wipes the sweat from\n     her brow, tries not to smile.\n\n                                ABBY\n                  What are you looking at?\n\n                                  MICHAEL\n                  Everything.\n\n     He steps over and they're in each other's arms.

The Captain's forehead explodes\n     and he falls to the ground.\n\n     Shocked, Bethlehem whirls for the source of the GUNFIRE.\n\n     Abby!   FIRING from a position behind a supply wagon.\n\n     But even as Bethlehem turns, an ARROW SINGS in and lodges\n     in his arm. Fired from a pocket of sentries up on the\n     palisade. Bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain.\n\n     The Postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab\n     the fallen Captain's gun.\n\n     He pulls a Holnist rider from his horse and swings into\n     the saddle. The unhorsed rider goes for his gun. But\n     once more SHOTS RING OUT and he goes down.\n\n     Bethlehem ducks as another BULLET ZINGS close.    Too close.\n\n                              BETHLEHEM\n                Get her.\n\n     Two soldiers move forward.\n\n     Suddenly The Postman's HORSE comes THUNDERING -- trampling\n     the Holnist nearest him.\n\n     The other Holnist hears, looks back, sees The Postman\n     coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to\n     bear.\n\n                                                      (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 71.\n\n64   CONTINUED:                                                         64\n\n     The Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just\n     watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The\n     Holnist goes down.\n\n     The Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with\n     pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up\n     behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth.\n\n     More Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE\n     SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on,\n     heading into the woods.\n\n     Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts:\n\n                                   BETHLEHEM\n                  Colonel Getty!\n\n\n65   EXT.

When the thicket grows too dense,\n     Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides\n     off, easing him to the ground.\n\n                                   THE POSTMAN\n                            (disoriented)\n                  Abby...\n\n     Abby shushes him.

All but the SIXTH,\n     who pulls up to listen.\n\n     In the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black\n     smoke. The town is burning.\n\n     The HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes.

She swings for the\n     bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth\n     Soldier's head. He falls hard.\n\n     The Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby\n     pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything\n     of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter\n     closed.\n\n\n66   EXT.

We get a sense he's not going to use it on the\n     fish.\n\n\n     HANDS\n\n     plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON\n     The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face.\n     He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting\n     knife.

A silver Airstream, fifty\n     mobile homes and rusty Winnebagos resting on flat tires.\n     Flying from a pole: the flag of the restored United\n     States.

In silence, he walks over to\n     The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been\n     carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The\n     Postman.

Each\n      rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti-\n      Holnist propaganda from Ford.\n\n                              THE POSTMAN\n                I wish they'd stop saluting.\n\n      It's annoying him.

At that signal,\n      the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them.\n      The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're\n      alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a\n      moment.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                What the hell?\n\n      Urging his horse forward, he rides after them.

A rider is\n      silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post-\n      apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman.\n\n\n105   EXT.

The boy\n      pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far\n      gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed.\n\n                                LITTLE BOY\n                I missed him.\n\n      It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the\n      distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he\n      starts galloping back down the road.\n\n      Fearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes;\n      it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can.\n      Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the\n      saddle, snatches the letter as he passes.\n\n      The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be\n      when he grows up.\n\n\n106   EXT.

Everyone\n      dances.\n\n      The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her\n      letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing\n      with Ford.

The Postman continues on,\n      embarrassed but affected.\n\n\n      DANCE\n\n      The Postman taps Ford's shoulder, wants to cut in on him\n      and Abby. Ford steps aside. A beat before Abby decides\n      it's okay. They begin. Her eyes are on her feet, careful\n      that she doesn't take a misstep. But his eyes are on her.\n      And over it all, BLEEDING IN, the sound of HOOF BEATS.\n\n\n109   EXT.

She jerks the reins;\n      the horse rears in protest.\n\n      Ahead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang\n      upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight.\n\n\n      POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE\n\n      SIGHTING ON Ponytail. A hand comes INTO FRAME and brings\n      the rifle barrel down.

An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the\n      only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch\n      as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town.\n      George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein\n      up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping.\n\n      Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the\n      roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him --\n      along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns,\n      bows and rocks.\n\n      As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE.\n      George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the\n      storm, the ten soldiers go down.\n\n      Grim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer.\n      George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip\n      the weapons off the dead.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   Ford, I want you to get rid of the\n                   bodies.

Then he stands, leaps to the ground.\n\n\n      SENTRIES\n\n      They raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out\n      of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being\n      forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on,\n      down to...\n\n\n      HOLNIST CAMP\n\n      A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and\n      brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps\n      up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written...\n\n                                  BETHLEHEM\n                          (reading)\n                   Postage due...\n\n      Bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead\n      Holnist soldiers.

He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear\n      the words they're saying.\n\n      As he dismounts, a fresh-faced carrier takes the bridle.\n      The Postman's well past the point of fatigue.

He gently releases\n      the body. The current takes it and they watch as it\n      continues on its way to Postal Valhalla.\n\n\n143   EXT.

Amazingly, one gray house\n      still stands, miraculously untouched by whatever disaster\n      visited this place.\n\n      A wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and\n      The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45.\n\n                             SQUATTER\n                Howdy.

It's day, but the sky is\n      black with rain.\n\n\n147   EXT. HIGH TENSION TOWERS - DAY                                    147\n\n      The useless towers cutting across a valley.      Rain beats\n      down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along.\n\n      Up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the\n      storm.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                          (re: the tunnel)\n                   We can rest in there.\n\n      Abby is quick to agree.\n\n      Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur\n      of movement.\n\n      He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see\n      a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing\n      from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it.\n\n      The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading\n      straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds,\n      he's lost from view.\n\n      The Postman looks back at Abby.       She's shivering.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   Did you see that?\n\n                                 ABBY\n                          (shaking her head)\n                   I'm hungry, Postman.\n\n      The Postman guides her toward the train tunnel.\n\n                                                              119.\n\n148   INT.

FAR SIDE OF TUNNEL - DAY                                  149\n\n      The Postman peers into the rain, taking in the view of a\n      distant bridge. Abby comes to stand at his side.\n\n\n150   EXT. COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY                  150\n\n      A town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. The\n      Columbia River rushes far below. A sentry spots Abby and\n      The Postman approaching, blows a whistle.\n\n                              GUARD\n                Set the rifle on the ground.\n\n                              THE POSTMAN\n                This old thing?

Abby rests.\n\n      Ponytail, Chubby and Drew look up gratefully as one of the\n      citizens of Bridge City doles out bread.\n\n      The Mayor steps over, hands The Postman two loaves.\n\n                                 B.C.

The\n      lead scout doesn't budge, spots The Postman in the crowd.\n\n      He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever.\n      Then, with a flick of the reins, he's gone. The other two\n      follow. Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom. The\n      Postman's head swims dizzily. It's not over.\n\n      The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions.\n\n                                 B.C.

BOY\n                   What's a postman?\n\n      A silent moment. It's been so long, no one's sure how to\n      answer. The Postman looks down at the ground. The\n      carriers exchange deflated looks.

The tip of his cap\n                   -- when he had a letter in his bag\n                   with my name on it. Mine always\n                   came just after school. You could\n                   set your watch by him. Unless you\n                   were waiting on something special\n                   -- like a present from somewhere\n                   far away or a letter from your\n                   sweetheart. Then it seemed like\n                   he'd never come. I used to think\n                   they could make time stand still.\n\n      Several other listeners nod -- they're completely with\n      her.\n\n                                 ABBY\n                   I don't think we ever really\n                   understood what they meant to us\n                   until they were gone. Getting a\n                   letter made you feel like you were\n                   part of something bigger than\n                   yourself. No place was ever too\n                   far away for the postman. So\n                   nobody ever had to be alone. The\n                   postman was someone you could\n                   count on. Things just made more\n                   sense when they were around.\n                          (beat)\n                   That's the kind of world we used\n                   to have. A world a lot of us took\n                   for granted. And now we've got\n                   this one. And it makes me\n                   wonder -- what kind of world do I\n                   want my child to live in? I want\n                   my child to live in a world where\n                   hopes and dreams aren't just lies\n                   you tell yourself to get through\n                   another day. I want my child, and\n                   I want my friends -- I want all of\n                   us to live in a world where you\n                   still get your mail.\n\n      It's a   moment before anyone speaks.\n\n                                 B.C.

The\n      General mounts -- the model of military calm and\n      precision. Getty reins up beside him.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                   Reckoning, gentlemen. This is the\n                   day I've dreamed of.\n\n\n161   EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY                                         161\n\n      A sea of wildflowers separates the carriers from the\n      Holnists. The monster John Deere gun is ready for battle.\n\n                                                              130.\n\n162   EXT. HOLNIST LINE - DAY                                        162\n\n      Bethlehem stands with Getty, scanning the postal line with\n      his binoculars. The carriers look, just spoiling for a\n      fight. Bethlehem lowers his binoculars, smiles grimly.\n\n                              BETHLEHEM\n                They're an eager-looking bunch.\n                Morale's a dangerous thing.\n                       (to Getty)\n                Bring him up.

CARRIERS' LINE - DAY                                      163\n\n      The Postman, Chubby, Ponytail and Old George and all the\n      carriers have taken positions.\n\n      The Postman sights through a telescope.\n\n      He scans further down the line -- then stops when he sees\n      Ford. Bloody, beaten within inches of his life. He's\n      shackled -- surrounded by Holnist guards.\n\n      The Postman's eyes turn to stone.\n\n                              THE POSTMAN\n                       (to carriers)\n                Stay here. No one moves until I\n                give the orders.\n\n      He clicks his horse forward, toward the Holnist line.\n\n\n164   EXT. HOLNIST LINE - DAY                                        164\n\n      Bethlehem, flanked by Getty and the Holnist Sergeant,\n      watches as The Postman makes his approach. He reaches\n      into his pocket, withdraws a white kerchief and holds it\n      in the air.\n\n                              SERGEANT\n                Are they surrendering?\n\n                              BETHLEHEM\n                God, I hope not.\n\n      He watches for a moment as The Postman crosses the field -\n      - moving well within range of Holnist fire. Then, he\n      coaxes his horse forward.\n\n                                                              131.\n\n165   EXT.

They\n      meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way\n      over to the Holnists' side.\n\n\n      BETHLEHEM AND POSTMAN\n\n      As they come face-to-face.\n\n                              BETHLEHEM\n                My little shipping clerk.\n\n                              THE POSTMAN\n                We're both a couple of frauds.\n                You know it; I know it.\n\n      Bethlehem sneers.\n\n                              BETHLEHEM\n                Great men are made by other great\n                men.

No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure\n      what's going on.\n\n                              THE POSTMAN\n                I invoke law seven of the Laws of\n                Eight!

You're not\n                   a member of the clan. You don't\n                   have the right.\n\n      The Postman rolls up his sleeve. He rides the Holnist\n      lines displaying his brand for all to see. The Holnists\n      murmur amongst themselves.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   I have every right.

Is Bethlehem violating one\n      of the Laws of Eight? The men look at one another. Gibbs\n      looks to Getty. Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo\n      to his face.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                   Where do I know you from?\n\n                                THE POSTMAN\n                   'Cry Havoc!

Coming straight for each\n      other like medieval jousters.\n\n      Bethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the\n      scabbard, The Postman lunges.\n\n      The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the\n      ground hard.\n\n      Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a\n      better look.\n\n      The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem\n      are at each other like coiled snakes.\n\n      It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists --\n      especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in\n      tighter.\n\n      Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they\n      fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.\n\n      One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his\n      footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock\n      with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.\n\n      It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the\n      fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --\n      grabs The Postman's throat with the other.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                   I study people. I know your\n                   problem. Do you know why you\n                   can't fight?\n\n      The Postman can't answer.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                   You have nothing to fight for.\n                   You don't care about anything.\n                   You don't value anything. You\n                   don't believe in anything. That's\n                   what makes me better.\n\n      The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his\n      remaining strength to keep him at bay.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                          (barely audible)\n                   I believe in the United States\n                   Postal Service.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                 134.\n\n165   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 165\n\n      The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt\n      and pulls him over. As they roll to their feet, The\n      Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head.\n\n                                  THE POSTMAN\n                   Neither snow...\n                          (wham!)\n                   Nor rain...\n                          (wham!)\n                   Nor heat...\n                          (wham!)\n                   Nor gloom of night...\n                          (wham!)\n                   Will stay this courier from the\n                   swift completion of his appointed\n                   rounds...\n\n      Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on\n      top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to\n      pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to\n      die.\n\n      The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists.\n      Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the\n      faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps\n      for breath.\n\n      As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The\n      Postman looks to both sides.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   It doesn't have to be this way.\n                   We don't have to kill each other.\n                   We can live together.

Getty has shot him.\n\n                                 BETHLEHEM\n                   Would I had bestowed that time in\n                   the tongues that I have in\n                   fencing, dancing and bear-baiting.\n                   Oh, had I but followed the arts...\n\n      He dies.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   Grow like savages -- as soldiers\n                   will -- that nothing do but\n                   mediate on blood.\n\n      Getty throws his rifle on the ground. Other weapons are\n      laid down. The war, at long last, is over.\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   Somebody take a letter.\n\n                                 CHUBBY\n                   Huh?\n\n                                 THE POSTMAN\n                   A letter...\n\n                                                        DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n166   INT.

ST. ROSE - DAY                                                167\n\n      A beach town. No wall, no sentries, just cottages lining\n      a dozen sand-swept streets. A crowd has gathered to hear\n      The Postman's daughter, HOPE, mid-thirties, speak. Beside\n      her, a bearded, 52-year-old Ford in his postmaster's\n      uniform. They stand before a large, tarp-draped statue.\n\n                                 HOPE\n                   But he never did see St. Rose.\n                   There was too much to be done.\n                   He'd made a promise and in keeping\n                   it -- he traded one dream for\n                   another. With no regrets. And\n                   so, in honor of my father...\n\n      She unveils the statue: we've seen this before. It's The\n      Postman on his horse, low-slung in the saddle, leaning\n      down to pluck the letter from the Little Boy's hand.\n\n      There's an OLDER MAN in the audience who seems especially\n      moved by the statue. There's a younger man beside him.\n\n                                    OLDER MAN\n                   That was me.\n\n      As St. Rose applauds...\n\n\n                                                          FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n                                    THE END\n\n\n\n\n\nPostman, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Brian Helgeland\u00a0\u00a0Eric Roth\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:09.425897"}
