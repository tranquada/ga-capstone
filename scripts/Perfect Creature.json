The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet\r\nthere are small things that are different, not what you'd\r\nexpect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the\r\ndusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who\r\nlooks attentive.\r\n\r\n<b>                   GENETIC DOCTOR\r\n</b>                (continuing)\r\n         This Virus plays some unknown role\r\n         in the birth the Brothers.

A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is\r\nsomething about her that suggests more a prisoner or\r\npsychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.\r\n\r\n<b>                   GENETIC DOCTOR\r\n</b>                (continuing)\r\n         Strange isn't?\r\n\r\n                    Apprentice   DOCTOR\r\n         Strange?\r\n\r\n<b>                   GENETIC DOCTOR\r\n</b>         That God would choose such humble\r\n         vehicle for a miracle.

The baby is placed on linen blankets and\r\n cleaned by a nurse.\r\n\r\n A man now enters the operating theatre; we can tell the\r\n Doctor is uneasy. The man is dressed in a perfectly cut suit.\r\n He does not wear a surgical mask. His eyes are a piercingly\r\n clear light gray. He enters with two other men who look\r\n similar to him. By his side there is also a pristine boy;\r\n perhaps 8 years old, the same piercing eyes. They both\r\n approach the baby. The man stares serenely at the baby, all\r\n bloody, lying on blankets.\r\n\r\n<b>                     AUGUSTUS\r\n</b>           This is your brother Silus.

In the otherwise baby-like mouth we\r\n see something strange. There are two tiny fangs protruding\r\n from the otherwise smooth gums.\r\n\r\n We see Augustus smile. In his mouth too, we see two perfectly\r\n pointed teeth.\r\n\r\n<b>                     AUGUSTUS\r\n</b>                  (continuing)\r\n           Welcome to the world little\r\n           Brother.\r\n\r\n Cut to\r\n\r\n We end close on the baby; its piercing eyes.\r\n\r\n<b>                                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n</b><b>                                                                   6\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>4 PRODUCTION TITLE: ON BLACK.                                 4\r\n</b>\r\n                         Perfect Creature\r\n\r\n  The title fades.

It is 1969, but not our 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>5 EXT: STREET - NIGHT                                         5\r\n</b>\r\n  A street. The look - of the film and the night - is silver,\r\n  almost metallic moonlit skies. A hazy mist hangs in the air.\r\n  Wet, steel pools of water on the dark footpath where a man\r\n  stands. He stares up at a zeppelin passing overhead, its\r\n  shadow obscuring him briefly until it passes away. Then we\r\n  see him.\r\n\r\n  The man is handsome, in a perfectly cut long wool jacket;\r\n  dark gray. He wears perfectly shiny black shoes and we can\r\n  see the surrounding street reflected in them; Victorian,\r\n  Gothic buildings. This man is Silus. He surveys the street.\r\n  While the houses are beautiful, they're run down.\r\n\r\n  Silus - his eyes are the purest light gray you have ever\r\n  seen - takes a long long inhale through his nose, his eyes\r\n  closing briefly as if trying to sense/smell something. He\r\n  stops the breath and opens his eyes. They are clear, full of\r\n  purpose.\r\n\r\n  He bends down to the footpath, runs his hand along its\r\n  surface, almost caressing it. He closes his eyes. The camera\r\n  moves in, to end close on Silus' ear. As this happens the\r\n  soundtrack - all the noises in the night - become amplified.\r\n  We see Silus' face, see him concentrating intently. We hear\r\n  several individual noises. First a very quiet pitter patter.\r\n\r\n  Cut to\r\n\r\n  A cat, stealthily moving between some thorny rose bushes.\r\n\r\n  Cut to\r\n<b>                                                                7\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilus again; concentrating even more. Now the distant sound\r\nof trickling water.\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nA drain pipe, leaking.\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nSilus once more. This time we can hear \"plop, plop, plop.\"\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nA pool of water. Then \"plop\" as a drop hits it. The drop is\r\nnot water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in\r\nthe water. And another drop, \"plop.\" High speed CRANE UP from\r\n\r\nthis pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in\r\nthe shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a\r\nmouth, with blood dripping from it.\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nSilus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath\r\nreflected in those perfect light gray eyes.\r\n\r\nMusic - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly\r\nrises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so\r\nperfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on\r\nhis lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something\r\nvery dark, something very dangerous, is close by.\r\n\r\nSlowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there,\r\nwatching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for\r\nthe slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old\r\nGeorgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the\r\nwall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and\r\nbrickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall.\r\n\r\nSilus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect\r\nshining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a\r\ngun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art\r\nnouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards\r\nit, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along\r\nthe side of the wall, heading away from us.\r\n\r\nSilus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems\r\nalmost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon\r\nabove, before hurtling at high speed towards its target.\r\n\r\nThe shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops\r\nsuddenly in the light so that we can see it.\r\n<b>                                                                 8\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n A man. With reflective animal eyes and blood on his purple\r\n lips. And teeth; the teeth of a vampire. This creature\r\n immediately dives from the wall to the ground, just avoiding\r\n another two bullets that crash into the wall.\r\n\r\n LA as the man falls directly towards the camera.\r\n\r\n Silus now rushes forward, holding his gun out in front of\r\n him; he moves forward gracefully. He can see the man\r\n skillfully climbing up an adjacent derelict building. Silus\r\n tries to follow but his way is blocked by wire and fencing.\r\n He raises his gun towards the man once more, but he is gone.\r\n\r\n Close on Silus' enigmatic face. Those eyes. And in his mouth,\r\n two perfectly pointed fangs.\r\n\r\n Cut to\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>6 EXT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          6\r\n</b>\r\n We are outside a cafe; the cafe is a warm glow against the\r\n cold night. We see past the fine falling rain - through the\r\n large glass window that has swirling silver art nouveaux\r\n designs lacing across it - to a table inside, by the window,\r\n where two pristinely dressed men sit.\r\n\r\n Cut to\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>7 INT: CAFE - NIGHT                                          7\r\n</b>\r\n We are inside. Closer on the two men. One is SILUS. The other\r\n man is AUGUSTUS; the man we saw in the operation theatre\r\n before. Augustus has hardly aged at all.\r\n\r\n<b>                       AUGUSTUS\r\n</b>           The girl?\r\n\r\n We see Silus.

But her death served a\r\n           greater good. Every trap needs\r\n           bait.\r\n\r\n Augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe\r\n from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into\r\n a fine hardwood chair. The chair's swirling, delicate back\r\n creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe.\r\n\r\n<b>                     AUGUSTUS\r\n</b>                  (continuing)\r\n           Are you sure you won't join me?\r\n\r\n Silus shakes his head, no. The opium in the pipe crackles.\r\n\r\n<b>                     SILUS\r\n</b>           Perhaps this is beyond us. Perhaps\r\n           we should inform the authorities.\r\n           The human beings.\r\n\r\n Augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a\r\n Chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely\r\n cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then\r\n leaves. Silus now lifts the glass and we see what it\r\n contains. Blood; dark and red and viscous. Silus takes a sip,\r\n then looks over to the bar.\r\n\r\n There is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being\r\n treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed\r\n patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention.\r\n Tubes run from the young woman's arms.

The creature drops the woman and scales\r\n  the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds,\r\n  up four flights, then gone.\r\n\r\n  The kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a\r\n  passerby.

And then the CAMERA begins\r\n  to advance, like a POV, heading for the wall ahead. It\r\n  reaches the corner and then advances along cables running up\r\n  to the roof.

We can hear an argument in one room.\r\n  A crying child in the next. A TV blaring in another (playing\r\n  porno). But mostly the rooms are dark.

She gets\r\n  up and moves towards the grill high above on the wall. She\r\n  places a chair under it, then gets up on it, standing on tip\r\n  toes, trying to see if there's anything behind the grill. Her\r\n  hand reaches out and tries the grill, to see if it's secure.\r\n\r\n  Then she leans closer to it. Her face pressed right up\r\n  against it. Closer.

Silus has\r\n  paused at the door to the cell. Without looking back he\r\n  passes through the door, leaving Edgar to his prison.\r\n\r\n  Edgar, slowly turns back to the window in front of him.

The\r\n  streets are full; prostitutes, drug peddlers, apothecary\r\n  shops, the industrial revolution low down and dirty. There is\r\n  a fight breaking out between two men who are dressed like\r\n  punk rockers.\r\n\r\n  Several people are alighting from a subway exit; the exit has\r\n  \"Jamestown/Brougham\" on a nouveaux styled sign that might\r\n  remind you of a Paris or Barcelona metro, only dirtier.\r\n\r\n  We see Lilly in the distance, in her dark jacket, emerge from\r\n  the subway. She begins the short walk to her apartment. The\r\n  streets are crowded and there are plenty of Maori people in\r\n  this area, so there's plenty of food stalls; the air is\r\n  filled with the sound of evening prayers.

As\r\n  she walks we begin to hear voices; violent, arguing. Lilly\r\n  approaches an alleyway, the raised voices becoming louder.\r\n  She slowly places her bag on the ground and then pulls out a\r\n  revolver.

As a reflex she stamps on Edgar's foot and\r\nkicks him in the groin with her other.\r\n\r\nHe does not flinch. He smashes Steph into a down pipe on the\r\nwall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face.\r\nWe then see Edgar's face at her shoulder.\r\n\r\n<b>                   EDGAR\r\n</b>         Nice to meet you again.\r\n\r\nEdgar pulls back the jacket at Steph's neck to find no scars.\r\nHe pulls Steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her\r\nprofile.\r\n<b>                                                                67\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls\r\nunconscious to the ground.\r\n\r\n<b>                   FREDDY\r\n</b>         What's wrong?\r\n\r\n<b>                   EDGAR\r\n</b>         You brought me the wrong one.\r\n\r\n<b>                   FREDDY\r\n</b>         Does it matter, one's as good as\r\n         the next?\r\n\r\nEdgar's stare makes Freddy shut up and avert his eyes.

Far above, through the falling rain, past the high-\r\nrise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly\r\ncrescent in the sky.

The rain has given\r\nway to a fine mist.\r\n\r\nThen, as Lilly moves forward she senses something; that\r\nfeeling again, that she is being watched. She stands for a\r\nmoment as people push past, looks up at the gothic Victorian\r\nbuildings that loom out of the drifting mist. But there is\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nLilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist,\r\ncasting glances at the odd passerby.\r\n\r\nThen, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular,\r\ntaller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who\r\nstands out. He is immediately suspicious to Lilly. He is\r\nslowly moving through the crowd towards her. From under the\r\nhooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's\r\neyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. The man now\r\nputs his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something.\r\n\r\nLilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a\r\ncold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the\r\napproaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into\r\na pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From\r\nunder the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead\r\ncatches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach\r\nher, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for\r\nsomething. A gun.\r\n\r\nLilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the\r\nshining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand\r\ntowards her.\r\n\r\n<b>                   LILLY\r\n</b>         Police.

And then he is gone.\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nThe man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping\r\nat the hands that now threaten to throttle him.\r\n\r\nAnd we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only\r\nthe second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes.\r\n\r\nPeople in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with\r\nguns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man\r\nSilus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees\r\nwhat he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to\r\nchurch service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely\r\nbeaming out from it.\r\n<b>                                                                 70\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground,\r\nSilus' hand still on his throat.

He grabs Silus' hand\r\nwhich now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing\r\nit, in tears.\r\n\r\n<b>                    PARISHONER\r\n</b>          Forgive me.

Then the shot wildly pans and\r\n  twists to the street below. Again it zooms in, to the\r\n  entrance of the building, to a couple walking past in the\r\n  night, as if searching for any sign of something out of the\r\n  ordinary. We can hear the couples voices, talking about inane\r\n  things.\r\n\r\n  Cut to Edgar's face in the shadows. His eyes reflective, his\r\n  whole being readied and concentrating. He closes his eyes. We\r\n  move around to end close on his ear, the soundtrack becoming\r\n  stark as the sounds of the night become eerily separated and\r\n  distinct. One sound in particular, a kind of metal sound,\r\n  scratching slightly, growing louder.\r\n\r\n  Edgar's eyes open.\r\n\r\n  Cut to\r\n\r\n  A zoom speeding towards Lilly's bedroom window, then swooping\r\n  at the last minute to end on an apartment one floor down.\r\n<b>                                                                    74\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  And there, gently moving in the night air, a partially open\r\n  window, the latch grinding in the breeze.\r\n\r\n  Cut to\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>86 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUING                         86\r\n</b>\r\n  A whiz pan POV, ending on the lounge of Lilly's apartment;\r\n  as if we just caught the last part of someone turning their\r\n  head, as if alerted.

Then he\r\n  reaches out, as if to gently wake her, then stops as Lilly\r\n  stirs. She turns, curling up into the fetal position. Silus\r\n  is confronted with the old scars from Edgar's attack.\r\n\r\n  For a moment Silus stares at her. Stares. Then very quietly,\r\n  smoothly, he moves his head down, very close to her arm. He\r\n  sniffs it, as you would something very delicate, very\r\n  complex. Then he closes his eyes.\r\n\r\n  We see Lilly, her arm. Silus slowly enters frame, moves his\r\n  face close to Lilly, moves along her arm as if taking in her\r\n  scent. Slowly her arm raises, as his face moves up her body\r\n  to her neck, her hand now embracing Silus' head.

She moves the\r\n\r\n   chains that bind her hands closer to the bracket and begins\r\n   rubbing the chains against the bracket in the vain hope that\r\n   she may be able to cut her way through the chains. She\r\n   strains harder and harder, fighting back the tears, the fear,\r\n   she just grinds at the chain repetitively.\r\n\r\n   Cut to\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>104 INT: HOSPITAL, STEPH'S ROOM - DAY                           104\r\n</b>\r\n   Steph, in the hospital bed, her eyes staring up, hollow.

People screaming, being\r\n   restrained. What is clear is that the virus Steph had has now\r\n   broken out into a plague of biblical proportions.

A perfect creature observing the\r\n   chaos. As he stands there he can see a small child; a girl,\r\n   maybe around five. Silus stares at the child. The girl is\r\n   holding her mother's hand. Her mother lies on a cot, strapped\r\n   down; there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway.\r\n   Her mother is dead. The girl's dirty face is stained with\r\n   tears. For a moment Silus wavers.\r\n\r\n   Then he moves over to the girl. She    stares up at him with her\r\n   tear stained grimy face. Silus goes    to place his hand on her\r\n   forehead as blessing, but the child    cringes, then jumps up\r\n   and escapes down the hallway.

He holds up his arm to Silus.\r\n\r\n    Silus stares at the tube coming from Edgar's arm. Edgar moves\r\n    towards Silus, twisting on the tube so that his infected\r\n    blood drips onto the ground.\r\n\r\n<b>                        EDGAR\r\n</b>                     (continuing)\r\n              You're almost there anyway.\r\n\r\n    And then Silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now\r\n    gripping Edgar's hand; surprise in Edgar's eyes.\r\n\r\n    He pulls Edgar toward him with all his might, his hand\r\n    clamping onto Edgar's throat - the power of the entwined\r\n    bodies immense - then Edgar whipping his body, breaking\r\n    Silus' grip, smashing Silus on the side of the head, but then\r\n    only to get a kick from Silus directly in the stomach that\r\n    sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping\r\n    into his back. Edgar screams.\r\n<b>                                                                   100\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>122 INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, CELL - CONTINUING          122\r\n</b>\r\n   Lilly. Half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her,\r\n   twisting. The sound of Edgar's screams makes her groan,\r\n   awaken a little, dazed. Then there is a loud clang. She\r\n   cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her\r\n   cell. She catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel.\r\n\r\n<b>                        LILLY\r\n</b>             Silus...\r\n<b>                                                                101\r\n</b>\r\n\r\nThen the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs\r\nnot completely following the brains instructions, but doing\r\nenough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in\r\na shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet\r\nwall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that\r\nfollows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half\r\nmad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then\r\npropels itself towards her.\r\n\r\nWe see it's POV, approaching faster, faster.\r\n\r\nAnd Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling\r\nto hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching\r\nthe door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is\r\nalmost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just\r\ncatching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that\r\nis about to attack her.\r\n\r\nThe thing on the other side of the door is now screaming\r\nwildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature\r\ntries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying\r\ndesperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep\r\nslipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she\r\nhangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the\r\nhole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her\r\nfeet slip more and more on the door.\r\n\r\nLilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too\r\nslippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the\r\ndark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands\r\ngrasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting,\r\nthe creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs.\r\nLilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe\r\nshe's attached to. The thing below her is groaning\r\nincoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly\r\npulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below\r\nher, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And\r\nthen she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting,\r\nwhere it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the\r\npipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way.\r\n\r\nThe creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt,\r\ndrag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water\r\nflowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe\r\nbursting out of the wall.\r\n\r\nLilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature.\r\n\r\nFor a moment neither of them move, then the creature is\r\ngrabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash\r\nLilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the\r\nface of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright.\r\n\r\nShe's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of\r\nthe pipe near the door.\r\n<b>                                                                        102\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    She begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to\r\n    rise and advance towards her. Lilly desperately slides the\r\n    chain along the pipe. It catches on a protrusion, while the\r\n    creature advances. Lilly frees it just in time, falling\r\n    backwards as the creature jumps at her, Lilly lifting the\r\n    chain up to hold the creature back. The creature strains to\r\n    get at Lilly. Lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck.\r\n    She begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only\r\n    hope now. The creature changes now, from frightening to\r\n    pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers\r\n    desperately moving over Lilly's face, almost pleading. Tears\r\n    form in Lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there\r\n    is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity.\r\n\r\n    The creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto\r\n    Lilly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>123 OMITTED                                                      123\r\n</b><b>AND                                                              AND\r\n</b><b>124                                                              124\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A\r\n</b>\r\n    Edgar and Silus stalk each other in the steam room. Edgar\r\n    launches himself towards Silus, but Silus is now too quick.\r\n    Silus slams Edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of Edgar's\r\n    face left on the pipe.\r\n<b>                                                                103\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising\r\nnow, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another\r\npipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the\r\nlook on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape.\r\n\r\nWe see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying.\r\nSteam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then\r\nbehind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded\r\ntank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a\r\nseries of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube\r\nand held in position by clamps; they look like they're for\r\nsterilizing bottles.\r\n\r\nWith a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of\r\nthe shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where\r\nhe's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has\r\noperated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the\r\nwound on Silus' back.\r\n\r\nCut to\r\n\r\nSilus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it.\r\n\r\nAnd now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer\r\nshafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on\r\nthe side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end\r\nof the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus.\r\n\r\nWe see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's\r\nstopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go.\r\n\r\nAnd Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards\r\nSilus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist\r\nto stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is\r\nright in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back\r\nat Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of\r\nthe shaft, ready to get some steam going.\r\n\r\n<b>                   EDGAR\r\n</b>         If I burn the skin from your face,\r\n         I wonder how that would be.

The steaming\r\nend of the shaft right in Silus' face.\r\n\r\nThen Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\nThe blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the\r\nshaft drifts into our frame.\r\n\r\nCut to Silus. His face is not scolded.\r\n<b>                                                                     104\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   Cut back to Edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face\r\n   redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. Then he\r\n   goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff\r\n   of steam.\r\n\r\n   And then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is\r\n   Lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam\r\n   still rising from the sharp end of it.\r\n\r\n   Cut to Edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam\r\n   rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.\r\n\r\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO:\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n<b>125 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, QUARANTINE ZONE - NIGHT               125\r\n</b>\r\n   POV steadicaming through the streets of the Quarantine zone.\r\n\r\n   The POV belongs to Lilly who moves down the street, half\r\n   carrying Silus who limps.

And finally she sees\r\n   the Brother Priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a\r\n   crate. He looks up at her as she approaches.\r\n\r\n   As Lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate.\r\n   Wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby.\r\n\r\n   In the corner Lilly can see a woman - the child's mother -\r\n   dead from the infection.\r\n\r\n   The baby cries and Lilly can see the tiny fangs of a Brother\r\n   in the baby's mouth.\r\n\r\n<b>                       PRIEST 2\r\n</b>             The first female of her kind.
