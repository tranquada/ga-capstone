Flecks of green\n        and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments\n        surround the undulating center.\n\n        The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic\n        surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely\n        etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top\n        and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers\n        fluctuations of the iris.\n\n        The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits\n        on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,\n        looks like an over-stuffed kid.  \"LEON\" it says on\n        his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's\n        uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in\n        his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.\n\n        The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed\n        in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop\n        or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all\n        business, except for the sweat on his face.\n\n        The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk\n        are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans\n        whir above their heads.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Okay if I talk?\n\n        Holden doesn't answer.

Answer\n                  quickly as you can.\n\n        Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.\n        Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke\n        response.\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  You're in a desert, walking along\n                  in the sand when all of a sudden\n                  you look down and see a...\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  What one?\n\n        It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  What?\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  What desert?\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  Doesn't make any difference what\n                  desert -- it's completely\n                  hypothetical.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  But how come I'd be there?\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  Maybe you're fed up, maybe you\n                  want to be by yourself -- who\n                  knows.  So you look down and\n                  see a tortoise.  It's crawling\n                  towards you...\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  A tortoise.

One of the needles quivers\n        slightly.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  You make these questions, Mr.\n                  Holden, or they write 'em down\n                  for you?\n\n        Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking\n        up the pace.\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  The tortoise lays on its back,\n                  its belly baking in the hot sun,\n                  beating its legs trying to turn\n                  itself over.  But it can't.  Not\n                  without your help.  But you're\n                  not helping.\n\n        Leon's upper lip is quivering.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?\n\n<b>                                HOLDEN\n</b>                  I mean you're not helping!\n                  Why is that, Leon?\n\n        Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in\n        the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside\n        of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS\n        a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.\n        Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes\n        through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean\n        as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the\n        bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the\n        floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he\n        stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,\n        FIRES at the machine on the table.\n\n        There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff\n        is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as\n        Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins\n        to blink, faint but steady.\n\n<b>        EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                     3\n</b>\n        The horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe\n        the end, of the beginning of a day.\n\n        The train that follows, cuts through the night at 400\n        miles an hour.\n\n<b>        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      4\n</b>\n        No clickitty-clack of track-bound noise, it's a long,\n        insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed\n        lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for\n        the passenger half way down.\n\n        His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten\n        years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a\n        track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but\n        the face has seen some time -- not all of it good.\n\n<b>        INT. TRAIN - REFRESHMENT DISPENSER - NIGHT              5\n</b>\n        Deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the\n        mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.\n\n<b>        INT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                      6\n</b>\n        Tired of the program, he takes off the headset and\n        drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a\n        sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up\n        staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a\n        hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans\n        closer and peers through the glass.\n\n        Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN\n<b>        ANGELES, THREE MINUTES.\n</b>\n<b>        EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT                                   7\n</b>\n        The train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with-\n        out a sound.  Carrying a bag and umbrella, Deckard\n        disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the\n        sweltering night.\n\n<b>        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   8\n</b>\n        Deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his\n        shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow\n        passage under orbs of yellow light.\n\n<b>        EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT                                   9\n</b>\n        Deckard unlocks his car and gets in.  Turns the ig-\n        nition and hits a sensor.  The dash console glows\n        and Deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool\n        things off.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD (V.O.)\n</b>                  It was 97 degrees in the city and\n                  no hope of improvement.  Not bad\n                  if you're a lizard.  But two hours\n                  earlier I was drinking Acquavit\n                  with an Eskimo lady in North East\n                  Alaska.  That's a tough change to\n                  make.  It was so good, I didn't\n                  want to leave, so I left a day\n                  early.\n\n        A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the\n        panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-\n        sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and\n        caller.  The last one is repeated five times.  Deckard\n        sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Contact.

The deep creases in\n        his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say\n        brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the\n        wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe\n        trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of\n        the desk reading the print-out.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD (V.O.)\n</b>                  They escaped from the colonies\n                  two weeks ago.

If the public\n                  found out that their door-prizes\n                  might kill them, they might not be\n                  so hot to go up there.  This was\n                  one of the worst one's we had and\n                  Bryant was worried.

Deckard stands out-\n        side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella,\n        as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden\n        downpour.\n\n<b>        INT.

Drop city is crowded,\n        cramped and darkly alive.\n\n        Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the\n        crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating\n        as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of\n        stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.\n\n        A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as\n        he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door\n        that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened\n        by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to\n        his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words\n        which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.\n        The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and\n        shuts the door.\n\n<b>        INT.

But Deckard finds the door\n        he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then\n        knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun\n        opens it.\n\n<b>        INT. LEON'S ROOM - NIGHT                                15\n</b>\n        An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in\n        and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a\n        place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly\n        clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless\n        basin is perfectly folded.\n\n        Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He\n        looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.\n        The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks\n        under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the\n        mattress.\n\n        The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.\n        Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes\n        out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-\n        fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-\n        lessness, he lifts off the lid.\n\n        It contains a little stack of photos bound with a\n        rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp\n        by the balcony window and turns it on.\n\n        A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of\n        anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.\n        The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the\n        sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded\n        polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of\n        simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious\n        collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies\n        them with interest.\n\n<b>        EXT.

He's still wearing\n        his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is\n        more intent, smarter and angry.\n\n<b>        EXT.

Looks like he could\n        do it for days.  And he could.  He's put a lot of alley\n        behind him and he's not out of breath.\n\n<b>        EXT.

Old slant-eyed enders humped over their\n        fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.\n\n        The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-\n        D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV\n        announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty\n        in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes\n        a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME.\n\n<b>                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE\n</b>                  Choose from a variety of seventy\n                  nine different personality types.\n                  Each and every one a loyal trouble-\n                  free companion given to you upon\n                  your arrival absolutely free...\n\n        The Latin beauty is replaced by an impeccable Ray\n        Bolger type gentleman's gentleman who clicks his heels,\n        snaps to attention and struts off to make room for the\n        next.\n\n<b>                                ANNOUNCER'S VOICE\n</b>                  To use as personal body servant\n                  to tireless field hand -- the\n                  custom tailored humanoid robot,\n                  designed especially for your\n                  needs.\n\n        The Chinese are paying no attention, but the man and\n        the woman seated at the table by the window are.\n\n        The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind\n        and blue-eyed.  MARY looks like an American dream mom,\n        right out of \"Father Knows Best.\"\n\n        The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,\n        short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,\n        but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a\n        presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what\n        goes on around him.\n\n        Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-\n        ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches\n        their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look\n        at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his\n        quiet voice.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Did you get your precious 'things'?\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Somebody was already there.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Police.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Just a man.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Police man.\n\n        Leon looks sullen.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Why don't you have a seat.\n\n        There's one next to him.

The view they're \"enjoying\" is\n        through the window.  Outside the neon side in the win-\n        dow directly across the street says:  HANNIBAL CHEW,\n<b>        MEMBERS.\n</b>\n<b>        INT.

After\n        a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent\n        smile.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  Well, you're right.

Premature old age has made\n        his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The\n        house may be dark but there's a light on in it.  Se-\n        bastian is a closet genius.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  You're a regular perfectionist,\n                  Sebastian.\n\n        Sebastian's apologetic, especially around the acerbic\n        Mr. Chew.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  It's gotta be right for my\n                  customer.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  Your customer, eh?\n\n        Chew snickers and beckons.  Sebastian follows his down\n        a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door.  There's\n        a moth-eaten full length fur coat hanging by it.  Chew\n        tugs it on and they go through.  The big door slams\n        shut behind them.\n\n<b>        INT.

The glass-doored compartments in the walls\n        look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office\n        boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed\n        box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into\n        the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts\n        an eye.\n\n        Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered\n        to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and\n        studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through\n        his pockets.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  You got a pocket-charger, boy?\n\n        Quick to accommodate, Sebastian removes a pencil-like\n        device from a row of such things in his breast pocket\n        and steps closer.  The back of the eye is touched with\n        the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring\n        back at them.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  Is that good enough for your\n                  customer?\n\n        Anxious to leave, Sebastian nods.  Chew reseals the\n        eye taking his time.  He can afford to, he's wearing\n        his coat.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  How much is he paying you?\n\n        In place of an answer, Sebastian clears his throat,\n        stares at the bag like he didn't hear.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  Well, when do you get paid?\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Soon as I finish the job.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  When might that be?\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Day after tomorrow.\n\n<b>                                CHEW\n</b>                  Oh!

It's a\n        jolt that causes him to yelp.\n\n        PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up\n        with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for\n        a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-\n        ing.\n\n        But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.\n        Sebastian puts the truck in gear, drives next to her\n        and opens the door.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Hey!

Both of them are silent.  People are not\n        Sebastian's medium -- usually he's too shy, but this\n        girl is shyer still, plus they're about the same age --\n        it gives him courage.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  What's your name?\n\n<b>                                PRIS\n</b>                  Pris.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Mine's J.F.

But emigrants needed\n                  incentive.  Over-population and\n                  the greenhouse factor didn't seem\n                  to be enough; but owning a human\n                  look-a-like had lots of appeal.\n                  It was big industry, the competition\n                  was stiff and Tyrell was top of the\n                  line.\n\n<b>        EXT.

The big religious boys\n                  said that Androids, no matter how\n                  human, were objects; only God\n                  could make people. I'm not religious,\n                  but I was inclined to agree.\n                  Otherwise I'd be out of a job.\n\n        The elevator door slides open.

Small northern animals in neat \"en-\n        vironmental\" cages.  He looks at the rabbit, the raccoon\n        and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops\n        him.

Dr. Tyrell is a\n        fragile man of power, with that look of \"youth\" obtained\n        from steroids and surgery.

The only sound is the insidious PERKING of COFFEE\n        BREWING in the background.\n\n        Tyrell taps a sensor on his desk.  The door in front of\n        Deckard and Rachael slides open.  They enter a vestibule\n        and face another door, this one befitting the decor of\n        the office, Tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as\n        they enter.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  Mr. Deckard.

If not for the fuzz and the silence,\n        the audio on the holoscope is off, you might think\n        you were ringside at the Garden.  It's a good fight but\n        Pris isn't watching.\n\n        She's got her feet up on the couch painting her toe\n        nails.  The room is so quiet you can almost hear the\n        polish.  She starts on her fourth toe when a NOISE\n        form above STOPS HER\n\n        It sounded like a CREAKING of a FLOOR, but so quiet,\n        sudden and over so fast it's hard to be sure.  She\n        stares at the ceiling a moment, then glances at\n        Sebastian.\n\n        On the other side of the room, in his own world,\n        Sebastian is peering into his magnifier, soldering\n        gossamer strands with a laser.\n\n        Pris has crossed the floor and is closing the door\n        quietly behind her.  If the animoids nestled around\n        the ledges of the room are capable of noticing, they'd\n        be the only ones in the room who did.\n\n<b>        INT.

It's\n        riddled with locks.  He slips a small device out of\n        his pocket, aims it at the door and the locks unlock,\n        the bolts slide open.  He walks in and kicks the door\n        shut behind him.\n\n<b>        INT.

Rachael almost got\n        shot.  But she's unruffled, a little pale maybe, but\n        direct as ever.  There's a long, chilly moment, then\n        she almost smiles as her eyes move to the plate on the\n        floor.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  Was that your dinner?\n\n        Deckard looks down at the over-turned plate and nods.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  I'm sorry.

The situation makes awkward silence.\n        At least for him.

Maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do\n        something about such an offer but...\n\n        Deckard's eyes follow her down as Rachael bends to\n        the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put-\n        ting it back on the plate.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  That's okay, I'll get it...\n\n        He bends down to help, but she's already done it.\n        Their heads a few inches apart.  Something in her eyes\n        diminishes the distance even more.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  Do I make you nervous?\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Yeah.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  I'm sorry.\n\n        And she is.  And suddenly he is too.  She hands him the\n        plate and they stand.  She's looking at the floor,\n        almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her.\n        She says it plain and simple.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  It's strange to suddenly realize\n                  that what you thought was your\n                  life is actually someone else's\n                  fabrication.\n\n        Deckard nods.

The snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue\n        flicking trying to get back to its mistress.  Absently,\n        she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.\n\n<b>                                ZHORA\n</b>                  You ever get the feeling things\n                  aren't the way they seem?\n\n        Her hand closes around the snake's head.  Deckard sees\n        it coming but can't move fast enough.  She strikes him\n        so hard it knocks him off his feet.  Before he hits the\n        floor, she kicks him in the stomach.  The snake whistles\n        through the air again as Deckard rolls out of the way.\n        It slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor.\n        He goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.\n\n<b>        INT.

He sprints after\n        her, arrives at the door and flings it open.  Black-\n        ness.  The SOUND of her high heels CLATTER down the\n        metal steps.\n\n<b>        EXT. STREET - OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                       66\n</b>\n        It's raining heavily.\n\n        The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-\n        fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,\n        hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-\n        ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly\n        lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of\n        place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to\n        run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.\n        Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,\n        trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for\n        shelter.\n\n        She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall\n        onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her\n        shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into\n        a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.\n\n        Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-\n        ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-\n        estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them\n        and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Stop or you're dead!\n\n        She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but\n        she's already around the corner.\n\n        With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move\n        so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps\n        in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a\n        stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-\n        hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.\n\n        The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit\n        him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-\n        tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and\n        jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-\n        senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about\n        face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum\n        plasters her against the door.\n\n        Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the\n        street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.\n        Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands\n        over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before\n        she dies.\n\n        Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it\n        over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.\n\n        Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,\n        trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's\n        running fast, but the car is faster.\n\n        As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids\n        broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he\n        rolls out FIRING.\n\n        Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...\n\n        The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes\n        through.\n\n        It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-\n        ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made\n        and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as\n        Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting\n        sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's\n        laser.  But she doesn't.\n\n        His last shot burns a hole through the base of her\n        skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed\n        takes what's left of her through the last two windows\n        and into the street where she runs into a parked car\n        with such force that she embeds herself in the side of\n        it.\n\n        Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-\n        ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something\n        for everybody and they're coming from all directions.\n\n        Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.\n\n        It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome\n        and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast\n        of metal and flesh.\n\n        Deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted.  So much commo-\n        tion he doesn't notice THREE COPS closing in from\n        behind.\n\n<b>                                COP\n</b>                  Drop it!\n\n        Deckard has his back to them.  They're fanned out and\n        crouched, ready to fire.  Deckard drops his laser.  Two\n        of them rush up, spin him around while the third does a\n        frisk.\n\n        TWO MORE COPS arrive, wary and wild-eyed, pushing the\n        people back -- his is not a good place for cops.\n\n        Deckard's ankle laser is discovered by the Cop frisking\n        him.  With a snarl he pulls it out and hands it back to\n        the SERGEANT covering the action.\n\n<b>                                SERGEANT\n</b>                  On your belly!\n\n        Deckard's not in the mood for it.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Listen, Sergeant...\n\n        He's reaching for his ID.  The Cop with the rubber\n        billy hits him in the head.\n\n        One thrill after another.  Somebody in the crowd YEOWLS.\n        The last thing Deckard hears as he falls.  The Cop\n        reaches inside Deckard's coat for the concealed weapon\n        they missed, but it's an ID card.  He looks at it for a\n        moment, then looks up.\n\n<b>                                COP\n</b>                  Hey, Sarge, this guy's a cop.\n\n        An embarrassing situation.\n\n<b>                                SERGEANT\n</b>                  Clear this fuckin' crowd.\n\n        The Cops start pushing.

The BARTENDER's a big lady with tits like sand\n        bags and a voice that plays no favorites.\n\n<b>                                BARTENDER\n</b>                  I can't protect your drinks,\n                  mister; while you was in the\n                  potty, this hummer snatched it.\n\n        Deckard glances at his stool-mate.  A huge MAN, slumped\n        over the bar like a beached whale.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  No problem.

Deck-\n        ard's drink arrives and the Russian raises his head.\n        It's a big melancholy face with a glint of warmth in\n        his red-rimmed eyes and a smile that could melt your\n        heart.  But it's Leon.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  I think I have no money.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  It's okay.

Leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach-\n        es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and\n        slaps that down too.  It's done with such pride that\n        Deckard has to look.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  You want to see my friends?\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Sorry, don't have the time.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  No problem.\n\n        Leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the\n        box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Those cockroaches?\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Ya.\n\n        Deckard looks interested.

ALLEY - OLD OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT                    69\n</b>\n        Deckard reels out.  The door swings shut and he's sober\n        as hell and moving fast.  Around the big trash dumpster\n        alongside the building, he plasters himself against the\n        wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door.  He's in a\n        good spot with a perfect line of fire.  Moments go by\n        and he's glad for the time to steady himself.  The\n        SOUND of his BREATHING, the HUM of the city and the\n        quiet.\n\n        Suddenly from behind, Deckard is swept off his feet and\n        twirled around in Leon's bear-trap embrace.\n\n        Leon lets go and Deckard hits the pavement, skidding\n        hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls\n        out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but Leon is so\n        fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand.\n\n        Leon moves towards him, backing Deckard against the wall.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  How come you know where Zhora was\n                  so quick?\n\n        His hand is lightning.

The sweat is starting to run.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  How old am I?\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  I don't know.\n\n        The grip tightens and twists.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  My birthday is April 10, 2015.\n                  How long do I live?\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Four years.\n\n        He lets go.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  More than you.\n\n        Deckard's knees come up fast.  Leon's fist comes down\n        faster, like a hammer.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Painful to live in fear, isn't it.\n\n        Deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  But that's how it is to be a\n                  slave.  The future is sealed off,\n                  he grovels, he waits.\n\n        Even hurt, Deckard is fast.  He goes for his ankle gun,\n        but Leon's got it out of his hand before he can even\n        raise it and throws it down the alley.\n\n        Deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and\n        scrambles to get away.  Leon grabs him by the foot,\n        drags him back and jerks him off the ground.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  Sex, reproduction, security, the\n                  simple things.  But no way to\n                  satisfy them.  To be homesick\n                  with no place to go.  Potential\n                  with no way to use it.  Lots of\n                  little oversights in the Nexus 6.\n\n        He slams Deckard into the wall.\n\n<b>                                LEON\n</b>                  I tell you, nothing is worse\n                  than having an itch you can never\n                  scratch.\n\n        Deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles,\n        protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next\n        one.\n\n        Leon folds his big hands together and raises them over\n        his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac-\n        tion of smashing Deckard's skull.\n\n        The spasm that runs through Leon's face is not from\n        satisfaction.  It's the bullet that went through his\n        neck.  He hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting\n        the air like a rabid dog.  Dead.\n\n        Rachael is standing in the alley.  Deckard lies there\n        looking at her.  She comes slowly and quietly forward\n        and drops Deckard's gun by his side.\n\n        Deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get\n        up, but can't quite manage it.  He looks up at her,\n        panting, spits blood and almost smiles.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Like I said, I don't need your\n                  help.\n\n        After a long moment, she bends down to touch him.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  You look terrible, you know that?\n\n<b>        INT.

He looks up at her.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  You ever take a bath with a man\n                  before?\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  There's a lot I haven't done with\n                  a man before.\n\n        He's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap\n        her arm.  Starting with her wrist and running the bar\n        to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery.  She\n        watches, not quite sure of the ritual.\n\n        He pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould-\n        ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under\n        her arm into the privacy of her dress.\n\n<b>                                RACHAEL\n</b>                  You're getting me wet.\n\n        Oh, yes.

He's\n        spread out flat, face creased and puffed.\n\n        His eyes squint open, but only for a moment.  His\n        hands are more reliable.  They search over the bed,\n        but find it bare.  He edges his head over the side,\n        looking around for signs, but she's all gone.  He\n        gets up in two stages, sits and then stands.  Then\n        sits again, resting his head in his hands.\n\n<b>        INT.

The front door opens a few inches and\n        Sebastian pokes his head in.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Mr. Deetchum?

As Sebastian crosses the\n        room a pig peeks out from behind the couch.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Hello, Wrigley.\n\n        He goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting\n        them into a bowl he's brought.  He puts down the bowl\n        and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the\n        payment and puts the money on a plate.  He's about to\n        leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.\n\n<b>                                SEBASTIAN\n</b>                  Mr. Deetchum isn't taking very\n                  good care of you people.\n\n        Pouring from a jug on the table, he fills the dispenser\n        with water, scatters a little grain on the floor, gets\n        his bowel of eggs and leaves.\n\n        Wrigley grunts and comes out from behind the couch for\n        a long drink.\n\n<b>        INT.

As they close, Batty smiles.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Could you tell me where the\n                  bathroom is?\n\n        Styles doesn't get a chance to answer.  Batty's hand has\n        torn into his crotch.  The man is lifted off the floor,\n        up the wall and held a moment.  Whatever is encased in\n        his pelvis is pulverized.  Batty lets go.  Styles hits\n        the floor.  He died of shock.  Grinding his teeth, Batty\n        continues towards the SOUNDS OF THE FESTIVITIES.\n\n<b>        INT.

Mrs. Tyrell looks around to find Batty\n        observing from the doorway.\n\n        A little startled, a little curious, but ever the cor-\n        porate wife, she smiles.\n\n<b>                                MRS.

Batty is washing his hands.\n\n        A portly maid emerges from the pantry.  Batty looks up.\n        She stops, embarrassed at being caught.  Her eyes no-\n        tice drops of blood on the floor and follow them to the\n        door.  When she looks back, Batty is right in front of\n        her.\n\n<b>        INT.

Rachael sitting cross-\n        legged with one in her lap, looking through exquisite\n        shots of nature.

But\n                  it was hard because she was curious\n                  and full of questions.  She was\n                  more alive than anyone I'd ever\n                  known.\n\n        She looks up stunned by the beauty of a photo, but with\n        no need to comment.

Nobody there, just silence.\n\n        He comes closer to the building and stands in the sha-\n        dows off to one side of the entry.\n\n        His head jerks up to the SOUND OF CRASHING GLASS.\n\n        Sebastian comes hurtling down and explodes into the\n        pavement thirty feet below.\n\n        Deckard's eyes move up the line of descent, the shat-\n        tered window on the next-to-top floor.\n\n<b>        INT.

Elevator and stair-\n        well.\n\n        Close to the wall, he moves towards the elevator, keep-\n        ing an eye on the stairwell door.\n\n        Stepping to one side, he hits the button.

STAIRWELL, SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT           97\n</b>\n        Steps into the dark on the other side.  Suddenly he\n        spins, dropping to the floor, and FIRES three times in-\n        to the figure hovering to his left.\n\n        The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into\n        the railing, neck broken -- with three holes in his\n        chest... but he was already dead.\n\n        Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the\n        old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were\n        feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard\n        gets to his feet.\n\n        The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot\n        touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters\n        the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young\n        girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY\n        STOPS.

The mirror-lined walls are cracked and\n        tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.\n        The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two\n        weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away\n        like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.\n\n        She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the\n        shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.\n        Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly\n        swaying.\n\n        Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches\n        the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,\n        keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the\n        door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-\n        ing.  Deckard's in his element.\n\n        Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It\n        isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his\n        eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.\n\n        It's not something he has time to consider.  In the\n        mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.\n        Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,\n        crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his\n        neck.\n\n        Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't\n        notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood\n        to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.\n        As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'\n        fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens\n        like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his\n        eyes roll back into his head.\n\n<b>                                PRIS\n</b>                  Naughty, naughty.\n\n        She lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot\n        into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the\n        room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.\n        Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.\n\n        Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-\n        ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,\n        she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the\n        floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches\n        out with a long index finger and flips the switch on\n        the machine.\n\n        It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally\n        an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing\n        on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A\n        bad place for flesh and bone.\n\n        But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-\n        year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds\n        his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull\n        his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but\n        it's welded in hers.\n\n        His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,\n        wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all\n        his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard\n        hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up\n        and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard\n        rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile\n        driver.\n\n        Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.\n        Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him\n        across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of\n        work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.\n\n        He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.\n        It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like\n        it was ice, weight stand in tow.\n\n        Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces\n        it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound\n        dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It\n        knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his\n        foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets\n        her with a roundhouse in the face.\n\n        She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell\n        over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her\n        life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts\n        him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and\n        lands in a heap.\n\n        No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She\n        rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-\n        head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down\n        for the kill, she freezes.\n\n        Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.\n        As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.\n\n        He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and\n        takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming\n        her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.\n\n        The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but\n        her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily\n        in front of her as she charges forward.\n\n        He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a\n        rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes\n        next to Deckard.  Dead.\n\n        He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls\n        over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-\n        gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.\n        The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It\n        might not sound like a war cry, but it is.\n\n<b>        INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                   100\n</b>\n        Laser in hand, Deckard kicks open the swinging doors\n        and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.\n\n<b>        INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                  101\n</b>\n        Deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his\n        loads and continues up the stairs.  He's going to shoot\n        the next thing that moves and find out later if he was\n        right or wrong.\n\n<b>        INT. STAIRWELL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT                   101A\n</b>\n        On the next landing he throws the door open.  His eyes\n        move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust.\n        None.  He continues up the stairs.\n\n<b>        INT. NINTH FLOOR - NIGHT                                102\n</b>\n        On the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for.\n        Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the\n        hall.  He stops to the side of it and listens.  Silence.\n        Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If\n        somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.\n\n        He kicks the door open and dives through head first\n        and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the\n        far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's\n        a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both\n        closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No\n        response from either door.\n\n        Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly\n        Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the\n        closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.\n\n        Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand\n        out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of\n        it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed\n        monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her\n        body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.\n        Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary\n        falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.\n\n        Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the\n        closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes\n        off her.\n\n        Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his\n        hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in\n        his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.\n\n        A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.\n\n        A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.\n        A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling\n        gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the\n        couch where he was sitting.  The hole is a couple feet\n        in diameter -- beams cracked through, exposing the\n        apartment above.  Silence.  Deckard wipes the plaster\n        dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:\n\n<b>                                DECKARD\n</b>                  Hello, Roy.\n\n<b>        INT. STAIRWELL - NINTH AND TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT          103\n</b>\n        Deckard comes out onto the landing.  Taking his time,\n        he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor.\n        He SHOOTS the hinges out of the big stairwell door,\n        pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a BANG.\n        The REVERBERATIONS turn into silence.  The corridor is\n        empty.\n\n<b>        INT.

Slowly he\n        turns the know and pushed open the door.\n\n<b>        INT.

Back against the wall, he moves to-\n        wards the bedroom, but stops at the NOISE.  It sounds\n        like the HOOTING OF AN OWL and it's coming from the\n        hallway.\n\n<b>        INT. CORRIDOR - TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT                     106\n</b>\n        Deckard looks around the corner of the door down the\n        hall.  Batty's at the other end.  Except for jockstrap\n        and gym shoes, he's nude.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  You wanna play?\n\n        Deckard FIRES.  Batty's fast.  He ducks into a doorway.\n        Pops out again.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Not very sporting to fire on an\n                  unarmed opponent.

Aren't\n                  you the man?!\n\n        The makeup on Batty's face is somewhere between a Coman-\n        che warrior and a transvestite.  The immensity of his\n        insolence awesome -- the muscles of his body are swol-\n        len, trembling from the thrill of it.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  This is how we do it up there, lad!\n                  Come on!\n\n        In a blue of lightning-like action, Batty whips down the\n        hall, zigzagging off the walls towards Deckard so fast\n        that Deckard gets only three SHOTS off before the blur\n        crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh.\n\n        Deckard stands there a moment -- digesting the impact\n        of it, then edges up to the gaping wall.  Batty is be-\n        hind him.\n\n        He knees Deckard in the back and slaps him in the head.\n        Deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face.\n        Batty kneels next to him.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Not hurt, are you?

And if you don't play, you\n                  don't get to be alive.\n\n        Deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding.  He exhales\n        and makes and effort.  He slides his hands up even with\n        his chest and starts to push.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  That's the spirit.\n\n        Like a matador, Batty walks away.  By the time Deckard's\n        on his feet, Batty's disappeared through one of the\n        doors.\n\n        Deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and\n        picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall,\n        towards the jeering voice.\n\n<b>                                BATTY'S VOICE\n</b>                  Come on, Deckard, show me what you\n                  got!

But it's only the reflection of Batty.\n\n<b>        INT.

Batty's next to him, grabs Deckard's hand\n        and steps in closer.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Straight doesn't seem to be good\n                  enough.\n\n        They're face to face.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  You don't have a chance, do you?\n\n        In an exaggeration of weary disappointment, Batty drops\n        his head to the side.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Looks like I'm gonna have to scale\n                  it down for you.

Okay?\n\n        Deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond.  Sud-\n        denly fury storms through Batty.  He throws Deckard out\n        the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar\n        and rams his head into the wall.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Come on, let's use that brain!\n\n<b>        INT.

He would like to have done it, but\n        he's not insane.  He gets to the landing and turns.\n\n        On the first step down, he stops.

Bloody and crazed, Batty pushes up\n        against him.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  What's wrong?  Don't you like me?\n                  I'm what we've made!\n\n<b>        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           116\n</b>\n        He's backing Deckard out the door.  Deckard trips and\n        falls.  There's fear on his face.  The strength is gone.\n        Something is starting to crack.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  What's wrong?  Aren't you a lover\n                  of Faster, Bigger and Better?!\n\n        Deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  It's time to die.\n\n        Deckard throws the laser at him.  It misses.  Batty\n        throws his head back and laughs.  A one-eyed colossus\n        about to eat the world.  Suddenly he stops.  His eye\n        moves over the wall.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Ah!\n\n        He reaches out and pinches something.  His lips compress\n        as he yanks it out of the wall.  It's a ten-penny nail.\n\n        He holds it out to Deckard and drops it.  Deckard\n        catches it.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  That's for you.\n\n        One side of Batty's face smiles savagely.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Stick it in your ear and push.\n                  If that doesn't work, try the\n                  eye.\n\n        Deckard stares at the nail in his hand, then up at\n        his executioner.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Believe me, it'll be better\n                  for you than what I'm about\n                  to do.\n\n        Batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire\n        his victim to more action.  It doesn't look like it.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Well?\n\n        Deckard springs to his feet and bolts.  But instead of\n        going for the stairwell he turns in the first available\n        door.\n\n<b>        INT. TENTH FLOOR APARTMENT #2 - NIGHT                   117\n</b>\n        Provocation accomplished. Batty smiles and walks lei-\n        surely towards the door.  Deckard's terrified scream\n        and the SOUND of GLASS CRASHING stop him.  Batty speeds\n        up and moves into the room.\n\n        The window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out,\n        bellowing in the wind.\n\n<b>                                BATTY\n</b>                  Crap.\n\n        He walks up to the window.  Deckard comes away from the\n        wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed\n        at the base of Batty's skull.  Batty starts to lean\n        over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he\n        knows.  He spins...\n\n        Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls\n        like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.\n\n        Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his\n        head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe\n        again.\n<b>        \n</b>        On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's\n        ankle.\n\n        With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a\n        banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-\n        ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the\n        hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops\n        the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead\n        fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.\n\n        Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He\n        struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.\n\n<b>        INT. TENTH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           118\n</b>\n        Deckard plunges down the corridor dragging Batty along.\n        He falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the\n        last couple feet to the stairwell.\n\n<b>        INT. TENTH FLOOR STAIRWELL - NIGHT                      119\n</b>\n        Groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves Batty's\n        body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,\n        then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-\n        ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the\n        edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds\n        and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As\n        Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the\n        railing.\n\n        Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement\n        floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost\n        four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.\n<b>        \n</b>        With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-\n        ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's\n        fingers are starting to slip.\n\n        His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over\n        Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything\n        he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The\n        thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.\n\n        The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but\n        Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.\n        He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.\n        He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the\n        left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-\n        hand grip.\n\n        Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't\n        be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over\n        the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself\n        onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.\n\n        And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly\n        clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's\n        his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware\n        of.\n\n        Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one\n        foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs.\n\n<b>        EXT. SEBASTIAN'S BUILDING - DAWN                        120\n</b>\n        Slowly the door pushes open and Deckard comes out into\n        the morning.  The sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has\n        begun to pale.  It's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not\n        very pretty, but even though he can't show it, Deckard\n        is glad to see it.\n\n        For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some\n        breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the\n        street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to\n        fall.\n\n        Deckard slumps into the shelter of his car.  The col-\n        lapses on the front seat.\n\n<b>        INT. DECKARD'S BEDROOM - DAWN                           121\n</b>\n        In a corner of the dimness Deckard sits slumped on a\n        chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window.  The\n        only SOUND in the room is the soft steady BREATHING\n        that comes from the bed.\n\n        Quietly he gets up and walks over to her.  Rachael lies\n        sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet.\n\n        Deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down\n        at her.\n\n        Moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of\n        the bed.\n\n        Rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.\n\n<b>        EXT. COUNTRYSIDE (MONTAGE) - DAY                        122\n</b>\n        Deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway.  He\n        and Rachael in the front seat.  Except for the occasion-\n        al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold\n        shine of an icy dream.\n\n        The clouds overhead are soft and swift.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD (V.O.)\n</b>                  She wanted to go to a place I knew.\n                  Out of the city.  Like one of those\n                  pictures she saw.  Where there were\n                  trees but no buildings.\n\n        Rachael's face in the window watching the woods stream\n        by.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD (V.O.)\n</b>                  We had a good time.  She told me a\n                  funny story and I taught her a\n                  song.  A song about monkeys and\n                  elephants.  And it made us laugh so\n                  hard we couldn't sing.\n\n<b>        EXT. WOODS (MONTAGE) - DAY                              123\n</b>\n        Deckard and Rachael walking.  The land lays white and\n        hushed before them.\n\n        Down an aisle of maples and beeches.  The frosty light\n        slanting through the clean, hard limbs.\n\n        The crisp, blue-white snow underfoot melted through in\n        spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.\n\n        Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her\n        warm breath turning the cold air to vapor.  Looking\n        lithe and fragile by these barren-rooted trees, she\n        stands in the crisp white snow looking at Deckard.\n        Nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on\n        knowing.\n\n<b>        EXT. WOODS - DAY                                        124\n</b>\n        Deckard walking over the snow.  Alone.  He walks slowly,\n        mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it.  His\n        gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears\n        running down his pale cheeks.\n\n        But for the SQUEAK of his wet shoes over the crusted\n        snow, there is no sound.  And Deckard recedes into the\n        silence of the freezing white landscape.\n\n<b>        EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                    125\n</b>\n        Deckard's car, solid, THROBBING, GUNNING along like\n        some metal animal.  Headlights piercing the dark of the\n        long, flat road.  WHISTLING speed of air and tires spin-\n        ning THRUM.  And then silence.  And the silence\n        astounded by the CRACK OF A GUN.\n\n<b>        INT. CAR - NIGHT                                        126\n</b>\n        Deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star-\n        ing straight ahead.\n\n<b>                                DECKARD (V.O.)\n</b>                  I told myself over and over again,\n                  if I hadn't done it, they would\n                  have.\n\n                  I didn't go back to the city, not\n                  that city, I didn't want the job.\n\n                  She said the great advantage of\n                  being alive was to have a choice.\n                  And she chose.  And a part of me\n                  was almost glad.  Not because she\n                  was gone but because this way they\n                  could never touch her.\n\n                  As for Tyrell -- he was murdered,\n                  but he wasn't dead.  For a long\n                  time I wanted to kill him.  But\n                  what was the point?  There were too\n                  many Tyrells.  But only one Rachael.\n                  Maybe real and unreal could never\n                  be separated.  The secret never\n                  found.  But I got as close with\n                  her as I'd ever come to it.  She'd\n                  stay with me a long time.  I guess\n                  we made each other real.\n\n        And the ruby lights of Deckard's car disappear into\n        the darkness.\n<b>        \n</b><b>        \n</b><b>        \n</b><b>        \t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Blade Runner</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Hampton Fancher\" title=\"Scripts by Hampton Fancher\">Hampton Fancher</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Peoples\" title=\"Scripts by David Peoples\">David Peoples</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Blade Runner Script.html#comments\" title=\"Blade Runner comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:00:40.611198"}
