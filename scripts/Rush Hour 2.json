The reason I'm screwed is\n\t\tbecause the entire department is about\n\t\tto find out the stolen credit cards we\n\t\timpounded were used to buy two first\n\t\tclass upgrades to Hong Kong.

I just put him out of his misery.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEE\n\t\tPut the plates down.  It's over.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tI don't think it's over.  There are\n\t\tcasinos all over this country.  Let me\n\t\tmake you a rich man, Lee.  Don't make\n\t\tthe same mistake he did.\n\n\tRicky glances at the gun in Reign's belt.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEE\n\t\tIf you reach for that gun, I'm going to\n\t\tkill you.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tDon't you remember?  I'm already dead.\n\n\tRicky makes a play for the gun, but Lee is much too fast,\n\ttaking the gun and pushing Ricky against the wall just as\n\tCarter bursts in the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tHey, Ricky, how's it going man?  What's\n\t\tup, Lee?\n\n\tLee has the gun pressed to Tan's head.  We've never seen him\n\tlike this before.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tWould you like me to tell you how your\n\t\tfather died?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tLee, you okay?\n\n\tLee doesn't respond.  He keeps an eye on Ricky.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tHe never begged for his life.  Or tried\n\t\tto make a deal.  All that he asked me,\n\t\tjust seconds before I pulled the\n\t\ttrigger, was that I promise not to kill\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tLee's finger is on the trigger -- he wants to pull the\n\ttrigger but can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tLee, wait a second.  It's not worth it,\n\t\tman.  He's making you do this.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEE\n\t\tIt's worth it to me.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tDo you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you\n\t\tgonna spend the rest of your life hiding\n\t\tlike your father?\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tC'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You\n\t\twon, now just put the gun down.\n\n\tLee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tRICKY TAN\n\t\tThat's what I thought.\n\n\tTan takes the black bag and swings it toward Lee -- the\n\tplates hit him across the face and knock him down.\n\n\tTHE GUN IS LOOSE\n\n\tTan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when:\n\n\tLee and Carter come flying at him TOGETHER.  Both KICKING HIM\n\tSQUARE IN THE CHEST.\n\n\tTan falls back, SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  Lee tries to\n\tgrab Tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second.\n\n\tBut Tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 STORIES to the\n\tstreet below.\n\n\tEXT.

She has ANOTHER BOMB IN HER HAND. \n\tThis one twice the size of the one from earlier.\n\n\t\t\t\tHU LI\n\t\t\t(in Chinese)\n\t\tWe'll go together, Inspector.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tPlease tell me she just asked for a ride\n\t\tto the airport.\n\n\tHu Li hits the switch - starts to smile.  Lee and Carter turn\n\tand RUN for the OPEN WINDOW.\n\n\tEXT.

A HUGE\n\tTRUCK speeds toward them as they hold on for their lives. \n\tThe entire STRIP SPEEDING toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEE\n\t\tI can't believe I flew ten-thousand\n\t\tmiles for this shit!!\n\n\tThey lift their feet just as the TRUCK PASSES.  The sign dips\n\tand they fall straight down into the open sunroof of a LARGE\n\tSTRETCH LIMO.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tINT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tLee and Carter land in the back.

The BOYS are all drinking champagne and dressed for a\n\tnight on the town.\n\n\t\t\t\tVERSACE SALESMAN\n\t\tWell, there is a God after all.\n\n\tLee and Carter exchange looks as the limo stops in front of\n\tthe hotel.\n\n\t\t\t\tLIMO DRIVER\n\t\tHere we are.

Lee and\n\tIsabella hug goodbye.  As she walks off to board her plane,\n\tLee slowly walks back to Carter who is smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tCARTER\n\t\tI saw that.  She kissed you, didn't she? \n\t\tYou played it cool, though.  Walking\n\t\taway, never looking back.\n\n\t\t\t\tLEE\n\t\tShe's going home to New York.
