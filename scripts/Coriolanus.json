CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Back at the Roman checkpoint, Menenius strides toward his\r\n          limousine. He has been deeply shaken by his interaction with\r\n          the transformed Coriolanus.\r\n          General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:\r\n\r\n<b>                         MENENIUS\r\n</b>          This Martius is grown from man to dragon.\r\n          He has wings; he's more than a creeping\r\n          thing.\r\n          He stops at his limo.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          91.\r\n</b>          A beat.\r\n          He turns back to Cominius.

Shuts the door.\r\n          The limousine drives off, sending up a cloud of dust that\r\n          swirls around Cominius.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Menenius sits in the back of his limo as it speeds back to\r\n          Rome.\r\n          The rejection by Coriolanus has wounded him. Also he is\r\n          plagued by guilt. He helped create this monster. He pushed\r\n          Coriolanus into politics. And now Coriolanus has lost his\r\n          soul, even his humanity, and Rome is to be put to the sword.\r\n          All his fault.\r\n          This preys on him.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

An\r\n          old chain link fence.\r\n          Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.\r\n          Thinking.\r\n          He stops.\r\n          He sits on the railroad tracks.\r\n          Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,\r\n          efficiently slits his wrists.\r\n          He stares out over the hideous landscape.\r\n          Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.\r\n          From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone\r\n          and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel\r\n          Beckett character.\r\n          He slumps over.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          92.\r\n</b>          Menenius is dead.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

Many just watch with grim dislike.\r\n          Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles\r\n          and cruel taunts.

As if\r\n          daring him not to crumble before her. He doesn't.\r\n          Aufidius watches everything closely.\r\n          It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:\r\n\r\n<b>                         VIRGILIA\r\n</b>          My lord and husband--\r\n          He stop her, almost a warning, with:\r\n\r\n<b>                         CORIOLANUS\r\n</b>          These eyes are not the same I wore in\r\n          Rome.\r\n\r\n<b>                         VIRGILIA\r\n</b>          The sorrow that delivers us thus changed\r\n          Makes you think so.\r\n\r\n<b>                         CORIOLANUS\r\n</b>          Best of my flesh,\r\n          Forgive my tyranny, but do not say\r\n          For that \"Forgive our Romans.\"\r\n          She shows great courage.
