A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY\n</b>\n\tIt's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the\n\tstreets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters),\n\tand the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary\n\tfigure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering\n\twhat appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a\n\tsecond to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back\n\tof his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the\n\taura of one who is making money for the first time and\n\tbroadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in\n\tthis part of town.\n\n\tWe follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second\n\tfloor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious\n\tdoorman.\n\n<b>\tINT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY\n</b>\n\tSuddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring\n\tpeople.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place\n\timmune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on\n\ta number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600\n\tto 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The\n\tbettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,\n\twhere they place their bets and are given receipts in return.\n\tOthers wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous\n\tearnings or to ask for credit.\n\n\tMottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting\n\tslips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful\n\tand somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man\n\tnamed Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on\n\tthe radio in the background.\n\n\tMottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little\n\tinterest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a\n\tlittle pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away,\n\tobviously having been through this before.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPHONE GIRL\n</b>\t\t\tBeat it, Mottola.\n\n\tGranger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,\n\twho plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.

They'll be waitin' for it at\n\t\t\tthe clearing house.  And don't stop\n\t\t\tfor no drinks.  You can get a cab\n\t\t\tdown the street.\n\n\tMottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat\n\tpocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.  No\n\tone would ever guess that he was just an overdressed\n\tmessenger boy.\n\n<b>\tEXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN\n</b>\n\tMottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.\n\tHe walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large\n\talleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is\n\tdeserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young\n\tstranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The\n\tman carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.\n\n\tSuddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere\n\tbehind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered\n\tlooking thief come racing around the corner and down the\n\talley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black\n\tman.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries\n\tfor help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at\n\tMottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies\n\thimself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands\n\tthere, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.\n\tJust as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws\n\this suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling\n\tand separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his\n\tleft hand.\n\n\tThe stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back\n\tto where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola\n\tpicks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts\n\tback toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both\n\tthe stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.\n\tThe thief, realizing that there are two people to fight,\n\tbegins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor\n\tparticularly strong.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTHIEF\n</b>\t\t\t\t(shaking his fist at\n\t\t\t\tthe stranger)\n\t\t\tYou fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get\n\t\t\tyou for this someday, sucker egg.\n\n\tMottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the\n\tthief flees out onto the street and disappears.\n\n\tThe black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is\n\tstaggering toward them.  He collapses against the alley wall\n\tafter a few steps.  The stranger rushes over to him, followed\n\tsomewhat absently by Mottola.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBLACK MAN\n</b>\t\t\tThe wallet.

Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of\n\tmoney.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSTRANGER\n</b>\t\t\t\t(a little uneasy)\n\t\t\tYou wanted by the law or somethin'?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tBLACK MAN\n</b>\t\t\tNaw, it's okay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSTRANGER\n</b>\t\t\tYou're crazy carryin' that kinda\n\t\t\tmoney in this neighborhood.

Mottola trots off down the alley and out\n\tonto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of\n\ttrouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the\n\tcab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the\n\tknife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.\n\tMottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking\n\tinto a dead run.\n\n\tWe follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening\n\ta big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi\n\tzone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door.\n\n<b>\tINT.

We see the following:\n\n<b>\tEXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY\n</b>\n\tHooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.\n\tIt's like seeing old friends again.

The place falls\n\tsilent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost\n\tafraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other\n\twondering how this could have possibly happened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tPOLK\n</b>\t\t\t\t(motioning to Hooker)\n\t\t\tAll right, Hooker, you can go.\n\n\tHooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter\n\tdisbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker,\n\tunable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk\n\tout.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at\n\tGondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his\n\tback and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from\n\this mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into\n\tGondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose.\n\tThe members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is\n\ttotally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's\n\tinvolved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tSNYDER\n</b>\t\t\tC'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

Hooker gives the\n\t\"office\" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back.\n\n<b>\tEXT. ALLEY AND STREET\n</b>\n\tThen Hooker and Gondorff leave.
