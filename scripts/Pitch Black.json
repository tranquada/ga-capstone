They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling \ncoyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life\nwhen stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake \nhits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates\nthat the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, \nbut on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. \nFor PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and \nlack of the same.\n\n\n\n                                                       David Twohy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<b>     CUT IN:\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

But the\n     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:\n     The world is dying around her.\n\n     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the\n     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE\n     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But\n     in the next cryo-locked...\n\n     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake.

But this last separation puts\n     the ship into a dangerous roll.\n\n\n<b>     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n</b>\n     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws\n     actuators...\n\n\n<b>     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n</b>\n     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll.

Christ, just\n               get this train moving!\n\n\n<b>     EXT. NIGHT\n</b>\n     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.\n\n     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING\n     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his\n     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.\n\n<b>                              PARIS\n</b>               Light, please, need light here....\n\n     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he\n     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.\n\n     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam\n     lunges at the last nanosecond...\n\n     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...\n\n     <u>CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back</u>.\n\n     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator\n     is long gone.\n\n<b>                              IMAM\n</b>                         (trembling)\n               Please...have we been cut?

It's like the night has claws.\n\n<b>                              PARIS\n</b>               Oh, sweet Jesus....\n\n     The bottle drops.\n\n     The blood flows.\n\n     The CLICKING STOPS.\n\n<b>                              PARIS\n</b>               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME\n<b>               LIGHT OVER HERE!\n</b>\n     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...\n\n     <u>Paris is gone</u>, snatched away by a swooping blur.\n\n     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a\n     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't\n     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the\n     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators\n     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a\n     pair of predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS\n     AGAIN to include the object of their desire. <u>Audrey</u>.\n\n     CLOSE on Riddick. Trying to figure it out.\n\n     CLOSE on Audrey. Listening to the HORRIFIC FEEDING SOUNDS.\n     Oblivious to all the attention she's getting.\n\n<b>                              FRY\n</b>               What do you see?

NIGHT\n</b>\n     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.\n\n     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS\n     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly\n     well, until...\n\n     The cutter sputters and dies. She ditches it and takes the torch\n     from Audrey.\n\n<b>                              FRY\n</b>               Bottle-count.\n\n<b>                              AUDREY\n</b>               Four fulls, one half.
