They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling \ncoyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life\nwhen stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake \nhits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates\nthat the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do, \nbut on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters. \nFor PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and \nlack of the same.\n\n\n\n                                                       David Twohy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     CUT IN:\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN\n\n     A CRYO-LOCKER BLOWS OPEN, spitting out...\n\n     CAROLYN FRY. She hits the deck of the main cabin: Four crew\n     lockers in a forward section, countless more in back. But the\n     deck is canted at a sick angle and ALARMS SCREAM everywhere:\n     The world is dying around her.\n\n     Legs wobbly, shivering like a flu victim, Fry stumbles to the\n     next forward locker. It's riddled with holes. One DEAD CREWIE\n     is seen through fractured plexi, body pocked and bloodied. But\n     in the next cryo-locked...\n\n     The CAPTAIN is struggling awake. Fry's face floods with relief.\n     Slapping an intercom:\n\n                              FRY\n               Hear me? Cap'n? Some kinda compromise to\n               the hull...holding for now, but...Goddamn,\n               I'm glad you're alive. Gotta pull your\n               E-release...no, red handle, red handle.\n               I'll get the warm-ups out while --\n\n     PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT-PHFUT: Particles bore through the cabin,\n     blasting open the captain's chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING\n     INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS\n     HISSING in the air.\n\n     Fry lands on her ass, horrified. Suddenly...\n\n     Another LOCKER BLOWS OPEN. A body falls right on top of Fry --\n     but this one's still alive. Disoriented, frantic:\n\n                              OWENS\n               Why did I fall on you?\n\n                              FRY\n               He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was\n               looking right at him when --\n\n                              OWENS\n               I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22\n               weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to\n               kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean,\n               I mean, why did I fall at all?\n\n                              FRY\n               You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai',\n               wait. I'm Owens. Right?\n\n     They swap nightmare looks, momentarily unsure of their own\n     identities.\n\n                              FRY\n               Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs\n               brain cells.\n\n\n     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN\n\n     They stumble into nav-bay. ALARMS CONTINUE. Fry grabs warm-up\n     suits out of storage, pitches one to Owens, checks her screens.\n\n                              FRY\n               1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,\n               shit, we're hemorrhaging air. Somethin'\n               took a swipe at us.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Just tell me we're still in the shipping\n               lane. Just show me all those stars, all\n               those bright, beautiful, deep-space....\n\n     Owens activates an exterior view: A planet rushes up at us.\n     That's why they have gravity.\n\n                              FRY\n               Jesus God....\n\n\n     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n\n     The SHIP PLOWS through the upper atmosphere, antennae pylons\n     already disintegrating.\n\n\n     INT. PASSAGE TO FLIGHT DECK\n\n     Heart battering her ribs, Fry runs forward, using hand-holds to\n     steady herself. Over a headset:\n\n                              OWENS (V.O.)\n               They trained you for this, right? Fry?\n               FRY?\n\n     She doesn't answer.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Fry harnesses in, starts running switches -- but fumbles a few\n     times, making mental errors. Finally she gets crash-shutters\n     open to reveal...\n\n     CLOUD STRATA sweeping up past the windscreen like floor-lights\n     on a dropping elevator. We're shedding big altitude.\n\n\n     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN\n\n                              OWENS\n               ... crisis program selected Number Two of\n               this system because it shows at least some\n               oxygen and more than 1,500 -- would you\n               SHUT THE FUCK UP!\n                         (hammers a button,\n                          SILENCES ALARMS)\n               -- more than 1,500-millibars of pressure\n               at surface-level. Okay, so maybe the ship\n               did something right for a change....\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     As Fry runs more switches.\n\n\n     INT. SHIP - DAY\n\n     As JETTISON DOORS CLOSE around the ship.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     As Fry flips up a security-latch -- and thumbs the switch below.\n\n\n     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n\n     MULTIPLE SHOTS: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around the ship's\n     skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics --\n     including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts\n     the ship into a dangerous roll.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Out the windscreen, cloud strata roll vertiginously. Fry throws\n     actuators...\n\n\n     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n\n     And airbrakes deploy. She manages to kill the roll. But the\n     ship's still coming in nose-high.\n\n\n     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN\n\n                              OWENS\n               ...showing no major water bodies...maximum\n               terrain, 220 meters over mean surface...\n               largely cinder and gypsum with some\n               evaporite deposits....\n\n     JETTISON DOORS CLOSE behind Owens, segregating him from the\n     passenger compartment. It scares him for a new reason.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Fry? What're you doing?\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Fry flips up a new security-latch. INTERCUTTING:\n\n                              OWENS\n               Fry?\n\n                              FRY\n               Can't get my nose down...too much load\n               back there....\n\n                              OWENS\n               You mean that \"load\" of passengers?\n\n                              FRY\n               So what, we should both go down too?\n               Out of sheer fucking nobility?\n\n     Tortured silence. Fry's thumb moves to the switch that will\n     jettison the passenger cabin. Jettison 50 people.\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN\n\n     SELECTED SHOTS of faces inside cryo-lockers, among them JOHNS.\n     He's prime-of-life, badge on display, some kind of cop. Shaken\n     awake, he clears condensation to check the locker directly across\n     from his, finding...\n\n     RIDDICK. Small black goggles hide his eyes. A metal bit wedged\n     in his mouth lends a perpetual grimace. A read-out admonishes\n     \"LOCK-OUT PROTOCOL IN EFFECT. ABSOLUTELY NO EARLY\n     RELEASE.\"\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n                              OWENS\n               Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible\n               for every one of those --\n\n                              FRY\n               Company's not here, is it?\n\n                              OWENS\n               When captain went down, you stepped up --\n               whether you like it or not. Now they\n               train you for this, so --\n\n                              FRY\n               And there wasn't a simulated cockroach\n               alive within 50 clicks of the simulated\n               crash site! That's how they train you!\n               On a fucking simulator!\n\n     Owens unbuckles from his chair.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Don't touch that switch!\n\n     Overcome by guilt, Fry retracts her thumb of mass destruction.\n     But a HUGE JOLT puts the thumb right back.\n\n                              FRY\n               I'm not dying for them.\n\n     She pushes it. But this time...\n\n\n     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n\n     No bolts fire. Nothing separates from the SHIP THAT SCREAMS DOWN\n     through the clouds.\n\n\n     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN\n\n     Now we see why: Owens reopened the jettison doors locally -- and\n     blocked them open.\n\n                              FRY\n               Owens!\n\n                              OWENS\n               70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to\n               level this beast out!\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Seething anger and guilt, Fry pops more airbrakes, shedding more\n     speed, more heat. The ship does level -- but it's still being\n     pounded hellishly. She tries to get a stable view out...\n\n     The windscreen. We're breaking through cloud-bottoms. There's\n     just a glimpse of landscape before...\n\n\n     EXT. SHIP - PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE - DAY\n\n     An airbrake fails. It shears off and pinwheels into...\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     The windscreen. It cracks into a thousand spiderwebs -- but\n     impossibly it holds. For now.\n\n                              OWENS (V.O.)\n               What the shit was that?\n\n     Sunlight flares from every fractured edge: It's like looking\n     into burning diamonds, and Fry can only get an impression\n     of the outside world. Now she has to rely on...\n\n     A ground-mapping display. 120 meters altitude. And dropping.\n\n\n     INT. CRYO-LOCKER - DAY\n\n     INTERCUT Johns. Realizing he's in some kind of shit-storm, he\n     claws at safety restraints.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Ground-mapper: 60 meters. COLLISION ALARMS kick in.\n\n     Out the fractured windscreen, we see a huge dark mass rise up\n     into view. Land.\n\n     40 meters...30...20...10....\n\n     Fry braces.\n\n     IMPACT. The WINDSCREENS IMPLODE. AIR HURRICANES in.\n\n\n     INT. NAV-BAY - MAIN CABIN\n\n     IMPACT. Chairs rip from their moorings. Strapped into one,\n     Owens slams into the ceiling.\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - DAY\n\n     IMPACT. Johns BLOWS OUT of his locker -- and wishes to God he\n     would've stayed inside, because just beside him...\n\n     The hull is cracking open.\n\n     NIGHTMARE SHOT: A huge section of the cabin tears free...\n     skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us...and\n     disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it.\n     40 lives.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - DAY\n\n     Hammered by WIND, Fry opens her eyes experimentally.\n\n     FRY'S POV: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring debris.\n     But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.\n\n     Fry pivots her chair 180 degrees a nanosecond before...\n     Dirt avalanches into the cockpit. It buries CAMERA.\n\n                                                       BLACKOUT\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     Choking yellow dust. Ghostly silhouettes are COUGHING, MOANING,\n     CALLING OUT to other survivors in English and, surreally, in\n     Arabic. Soon we find...\n\n     Johns. Ears running blood. Stumbling his way to...\n\n     Riddick's cryo-locker. Empty. Johns reaches for his holster.\n     Gone, torn right off his belt. No prisoner and no weapon --\n     spooky combination. Nearby he sees...\n\n     The light of a cutting torch. Someone's using it to open a\n     jammed cryo-locker. The plexi is torched away to reveal...\n\n     AUDREY, 12 years old. Unscathed.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Somethin' went wrong, huh?\n\n     Johns searches for his pistol. Behind him, two chained feet\n     lower into FRAME -- and then attack, swinging over Johns' head...\n     getting the chain on his neck...twisting hard, using the chain as\n     a choke-collar. Johns flicks open a baton, swings it up at...\n\n     Riddick. Still in body chains and mouth-bit. Clinging to a\n     ceiling support. Riding out the baton blows.\n\n     Seconds from blacking out, Johns strains forward...forward...and\n     finally breaks Riddick's grip on the support. He keeps hold of\n     the chained feet so that...\n\n     Riddick SLAMS HEADFIRST into the deck. Johns lays the baton on\n     his neck.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               One chance and you blew it, Riddick.\n               Never cease to disappoint me.\n\n\n     INT. FLIGHT DECK - CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     Darkness. A light beam sweeps the dusty air of the cockpit.\n     It's packed with dirt, no signs of life. About to search\n     elsewhere, Johns turns back at...\n\n                              FRY (O.S.)\n               Hey.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Hey, who?\n\n                              FRY (O.S.)\n               Hey, me. Over here.\n\n     His light finds a headrest sticking up from the dirt. Johns\n     crawls closer, checks the other side of the headrest and finds\n     her. Fry. Buried to the gills.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Amazing. I'm Johns.\n\n                              FRY\n               Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...\n\n     He manages a smile and starts digging her out. Almost dreading\n     to ask:\n\n                              FRY\n               Are there any others, Johns?\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     Johns helps Fry through the carnage. She's stunned by it all --\n     but especially by the blast of sunlight where a hull used to be.\n\n     Realizing she's in nav-bay, Fry starts digging like a search dog\n     to uncover...\n\n     Owens. Still strapped to his chair. Metal rod piercing his\n     chest close to the heart. Dead. Fry reaches out to touch him.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!\n\n     She recoils hard. He's still alive. The other survivors bungle\n     over. Ten seconds of pure chaos:\n\n                              VOICES\n               Pull it out of him...No, it's too close to\n               the heart...You gotta do it, just do it\n               fast....\n\n     Fry grabs the rod.\n\n                              OWENS\n               Don't touch it! Don't touch that switch!\n\n                              VOICES\n               You'll kill him, I'm tellin' you, shit,\n               just leave it alone...delirious...doncha\n               you got some drugs for this poor man....\n\n                              OWENS\n               Don't touch that switch!\n\n                              FRY\n               Awright, awright, someone...there's\n               Anestaphine in the med-lock, that end of\n               the cabin...next to....\n\n     But there is no more \"that end.\" In exquisite pain, Owens\n     screams on.

Everybody.\n\n     The others leave -- except for Audrey, staying behind to watch\n     in morbid fascination. Johns doubles back and collars her.\n     Leaving, they pass...\n\n     Riddick, cuffed to a bulkhead. His eyes, still hidden by\n     goggles, track Johns and Audrey toward daylight.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     The survivors straggle outside. CAMERA SURVEYS new faces:\n\n     ZEKE and SHAZZA. Male-female team of bushwhackers, partners in\n     life. Shazza has a tough sexiness. Zeke's face shows aboriginal\n     blood. (30s.)\n\n     PARIS. Overfed, overgroomed. A puff pastry of a man. (40s or\n     50s.)\n\n     Four male \"Chrislams\": The pillar-steady IMAM (50ish), and\n     THREE PILGRIMS, young and excitable (late-teens).

He loads a scrap-metal sled with tarp,\n     cable, pick-ax.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Amazing how you can do without the\n               essentials of life -- so long as you have\n               the luxuries.\n\n                              ZEKE\n               Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes\n               open. Don't want that ratbag sneakin' up\n               on me bloody-fuckin' arse.\n\n     He drags the sled toward the spired hills. Keeping one eye on\n     Zeke, Paris eases into a chair, lays the war-pick across his lap,\n     pours himself a spot of sherry. As he sips, a blade touches his\n     throat.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               He'd probably get you right here, right\n               under the jaw. And you'd never hear him\n               coming. That's how good Riddick is.\n\n     Paris eases the hunting boomerang away.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Now did you run away from your parents?\n               Or did they run away from you?\n\n     EXT. BONEYARD OVERLOOK - DAY\n\n     The scouting party approaches a rise. The trees loom just beyond.\n\n                              PILGRIMS\n               Allahu Akbar...Allahu Akbar....\n\n     The young pilgrims break into a excited run, anticipating an\n     oasis. But Fry hangs back, taking a harder look at the trees.\n     They don't move in the wind.\n\n     The pilgrims scramble up the rise -- and go motionless. Fry,\n     Johns and Imam catch up to behold...\n\n     The \"trees\" are actually the dorsal bones of a titanic skeleton,\n     tinted green by lichen. Beyond is a sea of bleached animal\n     bones. Impossibly, the bones seem to MOAN IN PAIN. All told,\n     it's like Hell overflowed right here.\n\n                              FRY\n               Is this whole planet dead?\n\n     A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC.\n\n                              IMAM\n               He asks what could have killed so many\n               great things...\n         \n\n     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Moving into the boneyard:\n\n                              IMAM\n               Some...communal graveyard, perhaps...\n               like the elephants of Earth....\n\n     Fry touches one of the towering bones. It shows cut-marks --\n     almost as if the bone was hacked by a sword. \"Graveyard? Or\n     killing field?\"\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Long time ago. Whatever happened.\n\n\n     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Pilgrim #1 reaches a huge skull laced with baleen-like combing.\n     Wind hitting the comb makes a LOW HARMONIC MOANING. By\n     moving a hand over the comb, the pilgrim can \"play\" DIRGELIKE\n     MUSIC. Wanting to show off the trick:\n\n                              PILGRIM #1\n               Ah....\n\n     He looks for Pilgrim #3 but can't spot him. And when he turns\n     back to the skull -- a face is staring through the combing. But\n     it's only...\n\n\n     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Pilgrim #3, inside the skull. Johns enters and chases him out.\n     About to leave, Johns notices...\n\n     Bone-chippings piled on the ground. It could be nothing, but\n     still...\n\n     Johns double-checks shadows, probing with the muzzle of his\n     shotgun. Satisfied, Johns exits. Now BOOM UP to reveal...\n\n     Riddick. Hidden in a sinus cavity.\n\n\n     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Trailing the others, Fry pauses to change out the O2 on her\n     breather.\n\n\n     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Riddick drops to the ground. His arms and hands are now pierced\n     with shards of boneyard ivory -- fashionable little body talons.\n     Spotting a shadow on the combing, he draws closer. And sees Fry.\n     Alone.\n\n\n     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Johns doubles back to Fry. He takes a hit of scotch, offers her\n     some.\n\n                              FRY\n               Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you\n               even more.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Probably right.\n\n     They drink anyway. Moving out of the sun, Fry leans up against\n     the combing. It brings her within arm's length of...\n\n\n     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Riddick. He pulls a bone-shiv, freshly chiseled.\n\n                              JOHNS (O.S.)\n               You know, I woulda played road dog for\n               these guys. You could've stayed back.\n               Pro'bly should've -- because, you know,\n               if we don't find water....\n\n     \"We may not make it back.\"\n\n                              FRY (O.S.)\n               No, no, I wanted to get away.\n\n                              JOHNS (O.S.)\n               So I noticed. Never seen a \"captain\"\n               quite so ready to leave her ship.\n\n     Just as Riddick eases his blade toward Fry's neck...\n\n\n     EXT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     She steps away.\n\n                              FRY\n               Better keep moving....\n\n                              JOHNS\n               What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching\n               the switch?\n\n     Fry searches his eyes, wondering if she can trust him -- and\n     again she leans back on the combing. We can actually see Riddick\n     now. They could too, if they would just TURN THE FUCK AROUND!\n\n                              JOHNS (CONT'D)\n               Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.\n\n                              FRY\n               Promise me. Swear to me you won't --\n\n                              JOHNS\n               You see anybody else here? Just between\n               you and me.\n\n                              FRY\n               During the landing...when things were\n               at their worst...Owens was at his best.\n               He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot\n               dump the passenger cabin.\n\n     Johns blinks, stunned. \"Are you shittin' me?\"\n\n\n     INT. SKULL - BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     Trying again, Riddick reaches out with his shiv -- and deftly\n     slices off some of Fry's hair. A locket. A souvenir. That's\n     all he wanted.\n\n                              FRY (O.S.)\n               So now you know.\n\n                              JOHNS (O.S.)\n               Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than\n               I thought.\n\n     Riddick watches them move off -- then looks at the scotch bottle,\n     left behind. It's still got one good swallow.\n\n\n     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - DAY\n\n     Leaving the boneyard, the scouting party reaches a cleft in the\n     hills. Ahead is a canyon.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Hold up.\n\n     He jumps onto a rock, puts the scope to an eye.\n\n                              JOHNS (CONT'D)\n               Didn't bite.\n\n                              FRY\n               What?\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Thought he might be coolin' it in the\n               boneyard -- could either double-back to\n               the ship or slip in behind us. So I left\n               the bottle out as bait.\n\n     SCOPE POV: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle. It's\n     still got that one swallow.\n\n                              JOHNS (CONT'D)\n               But nah. Didn't bite.\n\n\n     EXT. BONEYARD - DAY\n\n     CLOSER on the bottle. Only we see that the scotch has been\n     emptied -- and replaced with sand.\n\n\n     EXT. GRAVE SITE - SPIRED HILLS - DAY\n\n     Working under the shade of a tarp, Zeke digs a communal grave.\n     Three wrapped corpses wait nearby. He keeps a sight-line on...\n\n     The crash ship. Shazza waves. Zeke waves back.\n\n\n     EXT. RIBCAGE - THE GAUNTLET - DAY\n\n     The scouting party transits a narrowing canyon. Lined with rib\n     bones, it makes us feel like we're in the belly of some beast.\n\n     Fry squints at the ridgetops. More of those spires are visible\n     on the canyon rims, looming like silent sentinels. \"What are\n     they? Just mineral deposits?\"\n\n                              PILGRIM #1\n               Captain...captain....\n\n     The Chrislams have found what appears to be a small desert plant.\n     Leathery petals are spread wide, revealing a round stringy core.\n     ARABIC DISCUSSION. Desert fruit? Is it edible?\n\n                              FRY\n               Wait, wait, wait....\n\n     Fry takes the \"plant,\" pushes the \"petals\" back down over the\n     core. They all stare. It's a baseball.\n\n                              IMAM\n               We are not alone here, yes?\n\n     They look ahead, wondering what awaits them. But Johns is\n     looking back.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Never thought we were.\n\n\n     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY\n\n     HIGH ANGLE: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind. Fry,\n     Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.\n\n                              PILGRIM #1\n               Assalamoo ahlaykum!\n\n     The GREETING ECHOES through the settlement, built from stacked\n     shipping containers. Tattered sun-shades flap in the wind. A\n     rusty bike lies on the ground.\n\n                              PILGRIM #2\n               Assalamoo ahlaykum!\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Long gone. Whoever they were.\n\n     They move around a building -- and pull up short. Before them\n     looms a moisture-recovery unit, a hulking machine in disrepair.\n     Old jugs litter the ground.\n\n                              IMAM\n               Water...water there was here....\n\n                              PILGRIMS\n               Allahu Akbar....\n\n\n                              IMAM\n                         (translating)\n               \"God is Great,\" yes?\n\n                              JOHNS\n               I'm born-again.\n\n     Fry manages a weary smile -- but soon her eyes revisit the\n     abandoned buildings. \"Who were these people? Why did they\n     leave so much behind?\"\n\n\n     INT. MAIN ROOM - SETTLEMENT - DAY\n\n     Through a window, we see the Johns and the Chrislams crawling\n     over the moisture-recovery unit, assessing repairs. PULL BACK to\n     include Fry inside the settlement, inspecting...\n\n     Refectory table. Place settings out. Years of dust.\n\n     Photos on the wall: Settlers working modest gardens. Playing\n     baseball. Posing with children.\n\n     INT. LIVING QUARTERS - SETTLEMENT - DAY\n\n     Fry enters a dark room.\n\n                              FRY\n               Lights.\n\n     No response to her command. She pats around for old-style wall\n     switches. Nothing. Perceiving black-out blinds on a window, she\n     throws them open to reveal...\n\n     A man standing right outside.\n\n                              JOHNS\n                         (through window)\n               Hey. Don't go too far, huh?\n\n     Fry nods. Johns smiles, leaves. Just as her heart settles,\n     SOMETHING CREAKS behind her.\n\n     It's an orrery, a mechanical device that shows the motion of the\n     planets around their suns. Solar powered, the orrery starts\n     turning, CREAKING. One planet seems always to have sunlight.\n\n                              FRY\n               No darkness. No lights because no\n               darkness....\n\n\n     EXT. PORCH - SETTLEMENT - DAY\n\n     Fry reaches a porch. It looks out over the rear of the\n     settlement and more unforgiving terrain. She starts back\n     inside -- but something glints at the edge of her vision. Fry\n     turns back...parts clothes on a laundry line...and sees the\n     source of the glint.\n\n     Excited hits on her breather.\n\n     Fry vaults off the porch -- and starts walking as if on magnetic\n     bearing. Soon she's running.\n\n\n     EXT. SETTLEMENT - DAY\n\n                              FRY (V.O.)\n               Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!\n\n     Johns and the Chrislams trade looks.\n\n\n     EXT. SKIFF - DAY\n\n                              FRY\n               Allahu Akbar!\n\n     Fry stops on a groomed runway, out of breath. The others catch\n     up. They too marvel at...\n\n     The skiff, a light-duty vehicle of hybrid technology -- part bush\n     plane, part space craft. Its fabric wings are wind-torn -- but\n     the hull looks intact.\n\n\n     EXT. TOP OF CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     CLOSE on caviar being added to toast-points.\n\n     A SCRABBLING SOUND stops Paris in mid-bite. He eases out of his\n     rocker, moves to the rear edge of the ship and looks down on...\n\n     A shadow ducking under him. Small rocks still trickle down a\n     dirt rampart just climbed by...someone.\n\n                              PARIS\n               This now qualifies as the worst fun I've\n               ever had. Stop it.\n\n     No response.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     War-pick in hand, Paris eases to ground-level. He checks the\n     perimeter, looks inside the ship. Nobody. Is he being fucked\n     with? Again? He hopes?\n\n                              PARIS\n               Audrey? Oh, Audrey....\n\n                              AUDREY (O.S.)\n               What?\n\n     Paris spins. The voice came from the cargo hold -- and not where\n     he expected.\n\n\n     INT. CARGO HOLD - DAY\n\n     Blades of sunlight stream in through cracks in the hull. Paris\n     enters to find Shazza and Audrey cutting open containers,\n     searching for usable goods.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Tell me that was you.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?\n\n                              PARIS\n               Assailing my fragile sense of security,\n               that's what.\n\n                              SHAZZA\n               What're you goin' on about? She's been\n               right here for the last....\n\n     They all see it: Sun-blades are momentarily blocked by something\n     passing outside. Someone.\n\n                              SHAZZA\n                         (a quiet probe)\n               Zeke?\n\n     No answer. Audrey springs to the other side of hold, puts an eye\n     to a crack there.\n\n     HULL-CRACK POV: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the grave. He\n     starts toward the ship.\n\n     Audrey whirls back, mouths a silent alarm: \"RIDDICK!\"\n\n     Paris goes bloodless. Shazza grabs the war-pick out of his\n     frozen hands, moves catlike to the main doors and poises there,\n     ready to strike. Audrey follows with the hunting boomerang.\n     All eyes watch as...\n\n     The sun-blades, winking off and on, chart Riddick's approach:\n     We feel like we're inside a magician's sword box, watching the\n     blades shave closer and closer to us. Suddenly he appears...\n\n     And Shazza swings hard.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               No!\n\n     Facing them is a TOTAL STRANGER -- burned, half naked, one hand\n     still clutching the emergency-release lever of his cryo-locker.\n     Shazza stopped one inch short of killing him.\n\n                              TOTAL STRANGER\n               I thought...my God, I thought I was the\n               only one who....\n\n     He lurches toward Shazza, trying to embrace her -- and sees blood\n     and brain-bits BLAM-BLAMMING against her. His own. The stranger\n     sinks bonelessly to the ground. FAST RACK to reveal Zeke in the\n     background, pistol leveled. He reads Shazza's horrified face --\n     and understands what he's done.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Oh, Lord....\n\n                              AUDREY\n               It was just somebody else. From the\n               crash. He was just....\n\n                              ZEKE\n               Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The\n               murderin' ratbag. I thought he was....\n\n     He rushes over to check the dead stranger. As he bends down,\n     FAST RACK AGAIN to reveal Riddick in the background. He stands\n     20 paces off, still unseen by the others. His goggle eyes\n     covet...\n\n     Zeke's breather.\n\n\n     EXT.

The sun-tarp has fallen on one side,\n     blocking the sight-line between ship and grave. Zeke starts to\n     unload the body -- but sees something he didn't notice before:\n     There's some kind of opening at the bottom of the grave.\n\n                              ZEKE\n               Now what the bloody hell....\n\n     Zeke hops down into the grave.

SPIRED HILLS - DAY\n\n     CAMERA PURSUES Riddick as he lopes through the spires, running\n     from the scene of the crime. He turns a blind corner -- and\n     SOMETHING NEARLY BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF at close range. He hits\n     ground. A boot steps on his neck, keeping him there.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Same crap, different planet, huh?\n\n\n     EXT.

MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - DAY\n\n     Riddick is back in chains, face pulpy from the beating, listening\n     to SOTTO VOCE VOICES outside.

The eye\n     beneath is closed: For some reason, he won't look at her.\n\n                              FRY\n               Tell me about the sounds.

But if you cut it with\n               peppermint schnapps, that goes away.\n               Course, that's more for winter.\n               Summertime, I take mine straight.\n\n     Fry stares. Riddick gets a black satisfaction from his role as\n     Boogeyman: If fear is the only kind of respect he can get,\n     Riddick is going to grab some with both hands.\n\n                              FRY\n               Why don't we try the truth now?\n\n     A head-shaking beat, then:\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               All you people are so scared of me --\n               an' most days, I'd take that as a\n               compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta\n               worry about now.\n\n                              FRY\n               Show me your eyes.\n\n     Again he turns away.

That's how Riddick opens his eyes, startling us: No\n     irises, just huge black-pool pupils. And from deep within, a\n     jewel-like eyeshine. His eyes are as beautiful and unsettling as\n     those of a starved jaguar.\n\n                              FRY\n               You did this?

No ma'am, not this time.\n\n                              FRY\n               Then where is he? He's not in the hole.\n               We looked.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Look deeper.\n\n     He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her.\n\n\n     EXT.

Nervously, Fry traces the sound back\n     to...\n\n     Beads dangling from the belt of Pilgrim #1. Whenever he moves,\n     the STRINGS CLACK together.\n\n\n     EXT.

CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK\n\n     A second darkness sweeps over the survivors. Now they all stop,\n     beholding...\n\n\n     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK\n\n     Something pouring from the spire-tops. Backlit by coronal light,\n     it first seems to be smoke or ash -- but soon we realize these\n     are living things, HATCHLINGS SQUEALING IN DELIGHT over their\n     first nightfall.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Jesus, how many can there....\n\n     They keep coming, filling the sky with thick waves. Mercifully,\n     the hatchlings seem to be moving away. But now one wave cleaves\n     from another -- and does a quick about-face.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should\n               flee.\n\n                              FRY\n               Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold.\n               lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.\n\n     They run. Reach the cargo hold. Turn back to see...\n\n     Riddick and Shazza still coming. Hearing the SQUEALING WAVE\n     descending on them...\n\n     Riddick and Shazza hit to the dirt. Hatchlings torrent just\n     inches overhead.\n\n     CLOSE on Shazza. Horrified. Hard to breathe. Like being\n     underwater.\n\n     CLOSE on Riddick. He watches in awe, no more frightened that a\n     kid lying on his back looking up at the stars. Experimenting, he\n     eases a bone-shiv into the hatchlings. Instantly it's whittled\n     down to nothing. It's like a river of razor blades.\n\n     The hatchling keep coming. Shazza whips a panicky look at the\n     cargo hold. Can she make it? Should she even try?\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Tell her to stay there. Stay down.\n               SHAZZA, JUST STAY DOWN!\n\n     Shazza starts worming toward the cargo hold. Suddenly the\n     hatchings vanish. A beat. Is it safe? Shazza gets to her\n     feet...\n\n                              FRY\n               No, no, NO, NO, NO....\n\n     ...and the wave is back, enveloping Shazza.\n\n\n     INT./EXT. CARGO HOLD - DEEP DUSK\n\n     Standing in the mouth of the cargo container, the others get a\n     last glimpse of Shazza as she flies by the doors, caught up in\n     the funnel-cloud of hatchlings. Then she's simply gone.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK\n\n     Still on the ground, Riddick checks left and right like someone\n     about to cross a busy street. Now he gets up, smacks his hands\n     clean, strolls for the hold. Behind him...\n\n     A rising GANG-CLICKING.\n\n     CLOSE on Fry. She knows the sound better than anyone.\n\n\n     EXT. SPIRED HILLS - DEEP DUSK\n\n     The spires are crumbling, torn down from within.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - DEEP DUSK\n\n     Reaching the cargo hold, Riddick turns around for one last look.\n     PUSH IN as he sheds goggles -- and looks at the world with his\n     jaguar eyes.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: In degraded image, we see the predators -- adult\n     hatchlings -- emerge from the spires. They're large, mammalian,\n     hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out the\n     world they haven't inhabited in 60 years.\n\n                              FRY\n               What is it? What's happening?\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: The predators launch from the hills, gliding,\n     SOUNDING, searching.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Like I said. Ain't me you gotta worry\n               about.\n\n\n     EXT. SKY - DEEP DUSK TO NIGHT\n\n     The rim of the planet overtakes both suns. The world goes dark.\n\n\n     INT. CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     Vault-like DOORS BOOM CLOSED.\n\n     The survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship.\n     Somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their\n     cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               What if...what if she's still out there...\n               still alive....\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Well, I don't want to jump to conclusions\n               here...but 'member that boneyard?

Only the door of an open container about halfway down\n     the tunnel-like hold.\n\n     A volley of looks. \"How the fuck could one get in here?\"\n\n                              FRY\n               Breach in the hull.

Leading with his shotgun, he FIRES blindly\n     around the door. Something SQUEALS -- then silence. Johns eases\n     his head and a light around the door to spot...\n\n     Hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.\n\n                              JOHNS\n                         (to others)\n               Okay.

It\n     catches his shotgun, DISCHARGING IT, giving us...\n\n     A flash-image of an adult predator. Up close.\n\n     In one thin second, Johns is back with the others.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Very big beads.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Not staying in here another....\n\n     He goes for the main-door lever, ready to flee into the night.\n     Fry lunges for him.\n\n                              FRY\n               Christ, you don't know what's out there!\n\n                              PARIS\n               I know what's in here!\n\n                              IMAM\n               Everybody come, this way and we should be\n               safe. Hurry, please....\n\n\n     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     Imam shepherds them into a container. The door slams closed.\n     At first, only the sound of MOUTHS SUCKING BREATHERS. Then a\n     SCRATCHING.\n\n     Johns fumbles with a cutting torch. Gets it burning. Adjusts\n     the gasses to illuminate...\n\n     The door. Scythe-like blades are probing joints. Suddenly HEAVY\n     BLOWS drive everyone back.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n                         (to Johns)\n               Can you do sumpin' else with that?\n               'Sides holding it in my fucking face?\n\n     Taking the hint, Johns starts cutting the common wall between\n     containers. It's a race between the sparks of his cutter and the\n     blades of the predators.\n\n\n     INT. SECOND CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     An burn-outline appears in the common wall. Johns kicks out the\n     escape hatch. Audrey speed-crawls through first as...\n\n\n     INT. FIRST CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     Predators shred into the container right behind them, CLICKING,\n     sweeping, hunting.\n\n\n     INT. THIRD/FOURTH CONTAINERS - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     SERIES OF SHOTS: Again and again, they burn a new escape hatch\n     just as the predators break into the container being vacated,\n     always entering darkness.\n\n\n     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     Inside their fifth container now, Johns torches away. Fry and\n     Paris use cargo to block the entrance hole -- then block the\n     cargo with their bodies.\n\n     Riddick adds his weight -- until he notices pepper-shot in the\n     cargo. Suspecting the worst, he leaves the others behind...\n\n                              PARIS\n               Hello, hello?\n\n     ...and moves to the front of the container where darkness\n     prevails. Something SQUISHES underfoot. He slips off goggles.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This is the\n     open container, the one where Johns found predators.\n\n     Sensing energy, Riddick lifts his face.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of an adolescent predator. It squats atop cargo,\n     eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.\n\n     Sensing Riddick, it sweeps the area with INQUISITIVE CLICKS.\n\n     PREDATOR POV: Of Riddick.\n\n     (NOTE: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression\n     without detail. We're \"seeing\" what the predator hears with\n     echo-location. Think of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its\n     subject in 3-D space.)\n\n     Oblivious, the others kick out the new escape hatch. Audrey,\n     Fry, and Johns worm through. Imam and Pilgrim #2 hang back.\n     \"Where's Riddick?\"\n\n     He's in a stare-down with a predator.\n\n     Searching, Pilgrim #2 rounds a corner -- and finds his head\n     caught in a vice-like grip.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Don't. Move.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: As a second predator appears above them. This\n     one reaches down with its scythe blade...\n\n     And gently probes the two men. It wants know what they're made\n     of.\n\n     CLOSE on the pilgrim's shoes. Over-running with piss.\n\n     More blades descend, moving over them like surgical instruments.\n     One test-slices Riddick's shirt.\n\n\n     INT. SIXTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     In the next container, Fry waits anxiously. Hissing through the\n     escape hatch:\n\n                              FRY\n               Imam? Where are they?\n\n\n     INT. FIFTH CONTAINER - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a predator's scythe blade. It test-slices the pilgrim's\n     skin. Blood wells up.

Losing his nerve, he bolts.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               No....\n\n     The predators are on him, just blurs in the dark. DEATH-SCREAM.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: A third predator appears above him.\n\n     Making his move, Riddick darts around cargo and heads for the\n     escape hatch as...\n\n     Fry's light catches him square in the face. Blinded, Riddick\n     HOWLS and stumbles forward. Fry's light leaps deeper to hit...\n\n     The predator right behind him. With a similar reaction, the\n     beast HOWLS and flails back.\n\n     HOLD on Fry for a time-stopped moment. What stopped it? Was it\n     really her? Suddenly a SHOTGUN EXPLODES beside her head.

PLANET - NIGHT\n\n     The eclipsing planet dominates half the sky. In whatever coronal\n     light remains, we see clouds forming.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     Cargo doors crack open. Mixed for maximum flame, the cutter is\n     pushed outside and swept around. Fry appears behind it.\n\n     Moving like hostages, the survivors cross open ground, trying not\n     to heed the PRIMAL SOUNDS beyond their light. Soon they reach...\n\n     The main cabin.

Riddick TONGUE-CLICKS behind Johns.\n     He isn't amused.\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     PREP MONTAGE: We see the survivors powering up cabin lights...\n     yanking three more cells from the battery bay...threading nylon\n     cord through Paris' misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs\n     with high-octane liquor...swapping out O2 canisters.\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     Reloading his shotgun, Johns finds himself shaking again. He\n     unpockets a shell -- a red morphine shell -- and gives it a\n     lover's look. Behind him...\n\n                              FRY\n               Ready, Johns.\n\n     He palms the shell.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               He'll lead you over the first cliff.\n               You know that, don't you?\n\n                              FRY\n               We're just burnin' light here.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               You give him the cells and the ship --\n               and he will leave you.

What is so goddamn\n               valuable in your life that you're worried\n               about losing? Huh? Is there anything at\n               all? Besides your next hype?\n                         (no response)\n               Got no right to be so scared. Neither one\n               of us.\n\n\n     INT. BATTERY BAY - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     As hands yank the last power cell.\n\n\n     INT. MAIN CABIN - CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     Cabin lights die. Still brooding, Johns finishes loading his\n     shotgun in the dark.\n\n\n     EXT. CRASH SHIP - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a burning wick. Alcohol mist shoots across the flame to\n     create...\n\n     A FIREBALL. Two umbrella torches, fabric already burned away,\n     BELCH FIREBALLS into the night. By this light and more, we see...\n\n     Imam chained into the first harness of the drag-sled. Beside\n     him, Johns fumbles with a second harness. Hands help him into\n     the chains. The hands belong to...\n\n     Riddick. Both men recognize the irony of the prisoner helping\n     his captor into chains.\n\n                              FRY\n                         (to all)\n               Keep the light going. That's all we have\n               to do to live through this. Just keep\n               your light burning.\n\n     Riddick loops a handlight over his neck, places it to shine light\n     down his back. A beacon.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n                         (to Fry)\n               Be runnin' about 10 paces ahead.

NIGHT\n\n     The drag-sled begins moving.\n\n     SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS: Riddick running point, goggles off,\n     eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like\n     malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side-\n     guard position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position\n     carrying an umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling\n     along at rear-point, sweeping the cutter back and forth, every\n     shadow a threat. They are a train of light.\n\n     CLOSE on the sled. Holding four power cells and eight bottles\n     of booze.\n\n     CLOSE on Fry. Looking down. Noting sand-cat tracks underfoot.\n\n\n     EXT. NIGHT\n\n     Below us run the survivors. CRANE UP AND AWAY so that their\n     lights become insignificant...so that we include, in FOREGROUND,\n     the silhouettes of gliding predators. They're following from\n     above, awaiting their chance.\n\n\n     EXT. NIGHT\n\n     FRY'S POV: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have vanished.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               So you noticed too?\n\n                              FRY\n               Riddick. Riddick.\n\n     The procession grinds to a halt.

Why aren't\n               we still following them?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Saw something I didn't like.\n\n                              JOHNS\n               Such as.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me...\n               but looked like a bunch of those big boys\n               chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought\n               we'd swing wide. Okay by you?\n\n     Paris looks over his shoulder. \"We went around what?\" Nearby\n     CLICKING breaks up the confrontation.\n\n                              FRY\n               Let's move.\n                         (to Audrey)\n               Just a detour.

NIGHT\n\n     They trundle on, Fry the new tail-gunner.\n\n     At side guard, Paris relaxes a bit -- even though the CLICKING\n     never seems far from earshot. A weak FIREBALL SPEWS from his\n     torch. He checks the reservoir. Almost empty.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Light, please, need light here....\n\n     Still moving, Johns and Imam train lights on Paris while he\n     refuels. For a brief moment, Audrey strays from the light.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Dive-bombing the girl.\n\n     A HIGH-VELOCITY CLICKING: It's like an incoming missile. Imam\n     lunges at the last nanosecond...\n\n     And flattens Audrey to the ground. Scythe blades swing...\n\n     CHINKING the harness-chains on Imam's back.\n\n     Johns whirls, BLASTS. Light-beams leap around. But the predator\n     is long gone.\n\n                              IMAM\n                         (trembling)\n               Please...have we been cut? Can someone\n               tell me if....\n\n     He finds his dropped light, thumbs the switch again and again.\n     Broken.\n\n     In the confusion, Paris has been left in the dark. Something\n     slashes him from behind. It's like the night has claws.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Oh, sweet Jesus....\n\n     The bottle drops.\n\n     The blood flows.\n\n     The CLICKING STOPS.\n\n                              PARIS\n               Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME\n               LIGHT OVER HERE!\n\n     Faces whip around. But before their lights can rescue him...\n\n     Paris is gone, snatched away by a swooping blur.\n\n     Light-beams jump fitfully, vainly.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of predators feasting on Paris. Carrying a\n     youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and can't\n     find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the\n     youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators\n     start in-fighting, killing themselves for food.

NIGHT\n\n     Into a rising wind, the survivors range on.\n\n     Audrey now carries Paris' torch, refueled and COUGHING FIREBALLS\n     at regular intervals. Fry seems to be handling rear-point fairly\n     well, until...\n\n     The cutter sputters and dies.

In front of them.\n\n     Fry hears a SHOTGUN RATCHET. She spins to see...\n\n     Johns out of his chains. Moving forward.

Johns lunges for it, but Riddick kicks it\n     into the night. And then pulls his shiv.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Gotta stay in the light, Johns.

A club.\n\n     Riddick finds his own bone-club, and now they go at it like two\n     cavemen. Riddick beats on Johns' club-hand, breaking fingers,\n     forcing him to drop the bone.

Where'd Riddick go?\n\n     CLICKING behind Johns. He whirls to see...\n\n     Something big coming for him. Johns BLASTS IT back into the\n     night, dropping the light as he does. Eyes in the back of his\n     head, he whirls again and takes aim on...\n\n     Another bull-rushing predator.\n\n     Johns triggers a bad round. Crazed, he ratchets and levels the\n     shotgun for another try. He's too late.\n\n     BIG CLOSEUP as the ejected shell rolls to a stop. It's red.\n     Johns loaded a morphine shell in the dark.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: With Johns skewered by the armpits, the predator\n     lifts him off the ground and \"stares\" with a deceptively gentle\n     CLICKING-COOING SOUND.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Johns' final expression.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: The predator rears back its head -- then slams\n     forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its skull-blade,\n     splitting him in two.\n\n\n     EXT.

Far below, twin flames appear as the\n     survivors reach the gauntlet. Predators perch in FOREGROUND,\n     just hulking silhouettes \"watching\" from a canyon rim.\n\n\n     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     They are but five: Fry, Riddick, Audrey, Imam, and Pilgrim #1.\n     CLOSE on each face as they listen to the CANYON. There must be\n     countless predators ahead.\n\n                              FRY\n               How many you see?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               One or two.\n\n                              FRY\n               Audrey?\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Three full bottles. But almost time to\n               refill.\n\n                              FRY\n               Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on,\n               does it?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Only see one way. Turn the sled over and\n               drag it like that, girl down low. Light\n               up everything we got -- and run through\n               like dogs on fire.\n\n     A beat.\n\n                              IMAM\n                         (understanding)\n               The sled as a shield....\n\n                              FRY\n               And what about the cells?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               I'll take those.\n\n     She looks at him hard.\n\n                              FRY\n               We're just here to carry your light,\n               aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Let's drop back an' boot up.\n\n\n     EXT. BONEYARD - NIGHT\n\n     START on the power cells. They're been lashed together into one\n     queue.\n\n     Working amid the giant bones, Riddick crafts a new harness from\n     the old straps. Close behind him, Imam is MUTTERING IN ARABIC.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               What're you doin'?\n\n                              IMAM\n               Blessing you like the others.\n                         (off his look)\n               It's painless.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               And pointless.\n\n                              IMAM\n                         (a beat)\n               I see. Well, even if you don't believe\n               in God, it doesn't mean He won't be --\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               You don't see.\n\n     Riddick shrugs into the harness, snugs it down.\n\n                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)\n               'Cuz you don't spend half your life in\n               lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth\n               and not believe. And you surely don't\n               start out in a liquor store trash bin with\n               an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck\n               and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe\n               in God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.\n\n                              IMAM\n               He will be with us. Nonetheless.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Give my blessing to the girl. She needs\n               a spare.\n\n\n     EXT. START OF GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     The torches. Maxed out. Burning non-stop.\n\n     Fry and Imam. Sled chains on. Lapping up O2. Each holding a\n     torch.\n\n     Pilgrim #1. Clutching a handlight.\n\n     Audrey. Rolling under her sled-shield, becoming the turtle in a\n     metal carapace.\n\n     Riddick. Goggles on. He has no desire to see what horrors will\n     surround them. There's just one path, anyway: Straight through.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               As fast as you can.\n\n                              FRY\n               You sure you can keep --\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               As fast as you can.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     SLEW OF SHOTS: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging the shield\n     fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping along\n     behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already\n     tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo -- yet\n     somehow keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind,\n     flank them in fire.\n\n\n     EXT. CANYON RIM - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     As predators launch from the rim.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     First come the hatchlings, streaming right into their faces --\n     then veering away at the last second, repulsed by light. Next\n     come FERAL SOUNDS overhead.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Don't look.\n\n     Thin blue liquid spatters them.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Do not look up.\n\n     More spattering. Fry looks up -- and stumbles when she beholds...\n\n     A ceiling of predators. At the cusp of light, they dive and\n     weave and dart, slashing each other in a rabid desire to SOUND\n     OUT the humans below. It's like looking into a bucket of angry\n     eels.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Keep going, keep going, keep going,\n               keep going!\n\n     His voice whips them like the Devil's coxswain. Chastened, Fry\n     keeps her eyes down and speed up.\n\n     More blue blood showers down -- followed by entrails dropping\n     out of the sky. Could this be Hell itself?\n\n                              IMAM\n                         (a muttered mantra)\n               \"So dark the clouds around my way\n                    I cannot see,\n               But through the darkness I believe\n                    God leadeth me.\n               I gladly place my hand in His when\n                    all is dim,\n               And, closing my weary eyes, lean\n                    hard on him....\"\n\n     Now WHOLE CORPSES ARE CRASHING DOWN around them, victims\n     of in-fighting. Fry and Imam start slaloming through the ghastly\n     mess.\n\n     Pilgrim #1 passes too close to a corpse: A blade slices his leg,\n     drawing blood. He keeps his mouth shut.\n\n\n     EXT. CHOKE-POINT - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     The passage narrows into a choke-point. Fry sees it first.\n\n                              FRY\n               Riddick? RIDDICK?\n\n     Ahead, a clot of dead predators blocks the canyon.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               What? What is it?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               It's a fucking staircase! Go over it!\n               GO OVER IT!\n\n     Steeling themselves, they start climbing.\n\n     But Audrey, on all fours, has to discover the corpses with her\n     hands. Then, taking exception at being walked on...\n\n     One \"corpse\" snaps at her. Audrey recoils sideways...\n\n     And tumbles down the mound of corpses. She's exposed.\n\n     PREDATORS' POV: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes from 10\n     different predators.\n\n                              FRY\n               Audrey!\n\n     Audrey shakes out of it and scrambles for the shield just as...\n\n     A predator kamikazes onto the shield, its bone-blades piercing\n     the metal...\n\n     And nearly skewering Audrey beneath.\n\n     Caught in torchlight, steaming, the PREDATOR HOWLS as it tries\n     to rip free of the shield.\n\n     Beneath, Audrey hangs on and takes a thrashing.\n\n     The predator tears clear, spins, pounces blindly at...\n\n     Riddick, standing at light's edge. Stunningly, he catches the\n     beast under its scythe blades, blunting the attack. The predator\n     CLICKS MADLY at him.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick's face.\n\n     The predator rears back its head, ready to bisect Riddick with\n     its skull-blade.\n\n     Switchblade fast, Riddick drops a hand...\n\n     ...yanks his shiv...\n\n     ...and sweeps it over the belly of the beast. HOWLING, the\n     predator falls, disemboweled.\n\n     REACTION SHOTS of Fry and Imam. Stunned.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Didn't know who he was fuckin' with.\n\n     They regroup. Imam's head swivels back and forth: They're one\n     person short.\n\n                              IMAM\n               Suleiman!\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Get the girl back under. Keep going.\n\n                              IMAM\n               SULEIMAN!\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               KEEP GOING OR I WILL!\n\n     Suddenly Pilgrim #1 reappears, thrust back into the light by\n     unseen forces. He's still alive -- but shouldn't be. He makes\n     a feeble attempt to grab onto Imam, to anyone, but he's gone\n     again before they can even react, jerked out of the light. Out\n     of existence.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     They flail on. And now, finally...finally....\n\n     The canyon widens, opening up like some door to Heaven. The\n     WORST SOUNDS fall behind. We can see it in their sweat-sheened\n     faces: The faintest hope that maybe they've survived the Seventh\n     Circle of Hell. But then...\n\n     The TORCHES SPIT AND SPUTTER.\n\n     Audrey hears PATTERING on the metal shield.\n\n     Blood falls anew.\n\n     One torch dies -- yet somehow comes back to life.\n\n     Imam upturns a hand, checking the liquid for color. But this\n     blood has no hue.\n\n                              FRY\n               Oh, no. No, no, no....\n\n                              IMAM\n               Rain.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     RAIN MONTAGE: Water rilling, running, flowing over rocks and\n     ground.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     Caught in a downpour, the survivors slog to a stop. One torch\n     goes out -- and won't relight.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               So where the hell's God now, huh?\n                         (no answer from Imam)\n               I'll tell you where! He's up there\n               PISSING ON ME!\n\n                              FRY\n               Riddick? How close?\n\n     Riddick sheds goggles to look ahead. We don't know what he\n     sees -- nor what he's thinking.\n\n                              FRY\n               Tell me the settlement is right there!\n               RIDDICK, PLEASE!\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               We can't make it.\n\n     HOLD on Fry's anguished face, rendered in dying torchlight.\n     Somewhere behind, the AWFUL SOUNDS RETURN.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Here...hide here....\n\n     He's found a crevice in the canyon wall.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Inside...inside....\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     They crawl into the fissure. The second torch dies behind them.\n\n\n     EXT. THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     There's just one light left now -- the one Riddick wears on his\n     back. By its glow, we watch him lift the shield, muscle it over\n     to the crevice...\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     ...and slide it over the opening. A black beat.\n\n                              AUDREY\n                         (a beat)\n               Why's he still out there?\n\n     Fry's not sure. Is he protecting them? Or entombing them?\n\n\n     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     Working like Sisyphus, Riddick hauls the cells up a muddy rise.\n     He stops at the top, peers through the rain.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the settlement.\n\n     Riddick disappears over the rise. The four cells follow,\n     slithering through the mud like a serpent's tail.\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n                              AUDREY\n               He's not coming back, is he?\n\n     Fry checks Imam's face. Did Riddick say anything to you?\" Imam\n     wags his head. A bleak beat -- before Fry realizes she can see\n     his face.\n\n                              FRY\n               There's light in here.\n\n     It's a soft glow from above. Imam climbs higher to discover\n     small blue-white lights clinging to rocks. He plucks a few.\n\n                              FRY\n               What are they?\n\n     CLOSE on the lights in Imam's palm. They writhe with life.\n\n                              IMAM\n               Larva....\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Glow worms....\n\n                              FRY\n                         (mind racing)\n               How many bottles we got? Empty ones?\n\n\n     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Riddick boards the dark craft.\n\n     Connects the power cells to the battery bay.\n\n     Watches the ship come to life.\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a liquor bottle. It's half full of glow-worms.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               More, more, we need more....\n\n     They climb higher. Little by little, the bottle brightens their\n     world.\n\n\n     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Drenched in light, Riddick stands in the hatchway of the skiff,\n     looking out into dark rain. Is he struggling with a decision?\n     Or just savoring the safe harbor? Then very deliberately...\n\n     Riddick smashes his handlight on the hull. He steps inside and\n     closes the hatch behind him.\n\n\n     EXT. MUDDY RISE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     Something claws its way up the rise. Standing, we see that it's\n     Fry, a bottle of glow-worms strung around her neck. Ahead she\n     spies...\n\n     The settlement. Silhouetted by engine-light.\n\n\n     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     As the skiffs ENGINES WARM UP.\n\n\n     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     As Riddick dabbles with flight controls.\n\n\n     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     As Fry, running, splashes past buildings.\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     Audrey and Imam huddle around a bottle of glow-worms: This is\n     all they could harvest. Presently SCRABBLING SOUNDS on the\n     shield. Imam eases one eye to a small hole in the shield. He\n     can't see much until...\n\n     A blade rushes through the hole. Imam recoils hard, snatches up\n     the glow-worm light to see...\n\n     More predator blades exploring the edges of the shield. The\n     light drives them away. For now.\n\n\n     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Riddick dims interior lights, activates exterior lights. He's\n     actually startled by the sight of...\n\n     Fry. Standing in the skiffs headbeams. Daring him to run her\n     over.\n\n     Eye-lock.\n\n     Riddick opens the hatch.\n\n\n     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     They meet at opposite ends of the gangway -- Fry in the rain,\n     Riddick in the light.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Strong survival instinct. Admire that in\n               a woman.\n\n                              FRY\n               You're not leaving. Not until we go back\n               for the others.\n\n     He laughs at that.\n\n                              FRY (CONT'D)\n               I promised them we'd go back with more\n               light. And that's exactly what we're\n               gonna do..\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Think you've mistaken me for somebody who\n               gives a fuck.\n\n                              FRY\n               What, you're afraid?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was\n               his monkey. I only deal in life and\n               death. All that stuff in between? Some\n               shade of grey my eyes don't see.\n\n                              FRY\n               I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I\n               trusted that some part of you wanted to\n               rejoin the human race.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.\n\n     Fry realizes it's impossible to shame a shameless man. With\n     desperation edging her voice:\n\n                              FRY\n               Then wait for me. I'll go back myself.\n               Just give me more light for them.\n\n     He tosses her a light. The broken one.\n\n                              FRY\n               Just come with me!\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Got a better idea. Come with me.\n\n     Fry's mouth moves but nothing comes out.\n\n                              RIDDICK (CONT'D)\n               They're already dead. Get on board.\n\n                              FRY\n               You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't\n               leave you here. If you believe anything\n               about me, better be that.\n\n                              FRY\n               No, you see, I promised them...I have\n               to...I have to go and....\n\n     She's bleeding resolve. Riddick can see it -- can smell it --\n     and he keeps slashing away.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Step aboard, Carolyn.\n\n                              FRY\n                         (tortured)\n               I can't....I can't....\n\n                              RIDDICK\n                         (approaching, extending\n                          a hand)\n               Here. Make it easy on you.\n\n                              FRY\n               Don't do this to me....\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Just give me your hand.\n\n                              FRY\n               But they...they could still be....\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my\n               hand and save yourself, Carolyn.\n\n     A beat. She takes his hand -- and jerks him down the gangway.\n     They sprawl through mud. She gets a knee on his neck.\n\n                              FRY\n               I will not give up on them! I Will not\n               leave anyone on this rock with those\n               fucking things, even if it means --\n\n     In a blur, Riddick rolls and slaps a shiv on her neck. Is\n     history repeating itself? Riddick's face, though, is strangely\n     calm. Curious. Even gentle.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               You'd die for them?\n\n                              FRY\n               I would try for them.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               You barely know them.\n\n                              FRY\n               But I'm human. I know you view that as a\n               weakness, but I'm sorry -- I do feel fear,\n               theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick -- yes.\n               I would die for them.\n\n\n     EXT. CREVICE - THE GAUNTLET - NIGHT\n\n     MORE SCRABBLING at the shield. Imam cocks his blade back, ready\n     to do battle with...\n\n     Fry. She heaves the shield aside. Behind her, Riddick.\n\n                              AUDREY\n                         (big-eyed)\n               You came for us....\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed.\n               Anyone not ready for this?\n\n\n     EXT.

Then another.\n     Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major\n     gathering place.\n\n     Soon they all can hear CLICKING above the RAIN. Their nightmare\n     is far from over.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Get behind me.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a half-dozen predators shifting places at the\n     pool. A slim gap appears.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               When I go, we go. Full-throttle.\n\n     CLOSE on their hands, gripping each other.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Ready...ready....\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: The gap between predators widens into a passage.\n     A gauntlet within a gauntlet.\n\n     Riddick runs. Linked like paper dolls, the others follow blindly.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of a predator turning to \"stare\" over its\n     shoulder.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick bearing down fast.\n\n     The survivors hit the water like lawn mowers on legs, crashing\n     through, scattering water and predators alike, managing to\n     reach...\n\n     The muddy rise. Audrey loses her grip on the others...\n\n     And starts back-sliding. She CRIES OUT, turning the head of...\n\n     Riddick. He catches Audrey as her legs hit the pool. He muscles\n     her back up the rise and heaves her over the top, sending her\n     slip-sliding down the other side.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               You know the way!\n\n     Not waiting for him, Fry and Imam disappear over the rise.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of the predators. Regrouping. Crawling up the\n     rise at us.\n\n\n     EXT. NIGHT\n\n     Fry, Imam, and Audrey run hard, glow-worm lights bouncing wildly.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Chasing them.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Chasing Riddick.\n\n\n     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     Fry, Imam, and Audrey reach the settlement. They spill around a\n     corner and see...\n\n     The light of the skiff.\n\n\n     EXT. SETTLEMENT - NIGHT\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and Audrey\n     vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we\n     follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly\n     a predator is right there, right in our face.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He snaps a look\n     up.\n\n     RIDDICK'S POV: Of another predator perched gargoyle-like on the\n     building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.\n\n     PREDATOR'S POV: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs. Bracing\n     himself. Ready to blade it out.\n\n\n     EXT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     Imam and Audrey stagger aboard. Safe in the light of the\n     headbeams, Fry turns back, panting, waiting.\n\n     Waiting.\n\n                              IMAM\n               Captain....\n\n     He wants her to board the skiff. Fry gives it another beat, eyes\n     sweeping the dark rain. And just when we think it's over for\n     Riddick -- TERRIBLE SCREAMS are heard from both man and predator:\n     There's a helluva fight going on out there. Close out there.\n\n     Fry snatches the glow-worms off Imam's neck...\n\n     And plunges into the darkness, homing in on the SOUNDS until...\n\n     A blade flashes in her face. She ducks and spots...\n\n     Riddick. Bloody, muddy, he's down on his knees, still trying to\n     fight off the shadow-beasts that swirl and slash all around him.\n     Around them both.\n\n                              FRY\n               It's me, it's me, it's me!\n\n     She gets the light around his neck. Now we see his face\n     clearly -- and see a very human expression there: Fear. Fry\n     grabs his armpits and tries to pull him up.\n\n                              FRY\n               C'mon, Riddick -- said I'd die for them,\n               not you.\n\n     He gets his feet under him. Gripping each other, they start\n     moving, turning like dancers in a macabre waltz, hoping the\n     predators can't fix on Riddick's blood.\n\n                              FRY\n               Just 10 steps...keep turning, keep\n               turning...that's right...others're already\n               'board, waitin' for us right now...five\n               steps...c'mon, almost there, Riddick...\n               almost there...we're almost --\n\n     Something jolts them. ALL CLICKING STOPS.\n\n     EXTREME CLOSEUPS: Searching each other's eyes. Someone just got\n     slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Not for me....\n\n     In an eyeblink she's gone, ripped from his arms. There was no\n     scream. No cry. No final words. Just...\n\n     Blackness.\n\n\n     EXT. PLANET'S ORBIT - NIGHT\n\n     Out of the blackness, a spot of fire races toward us. It\n     resolves into the skiff, fabric wings burning off as it hits\n     escape velocity.\n\n\n     INT. SKIFF - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE on a bloody hand. It toggles through nav-charts, plots a\n     rendezvous with \"Sol-Track 17B\" shipping lane.\n\n     In the cockpit, Riddick finds Audrey beside him. She stares\n     hypnotically at the stars ahead.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Probably okay to talk to me now.\n\n                              AUDREY\n               Not sure where to go.

I was just runnin' away when\n               this whole thing....\n\n     Interior smiles. Stars sweep the windscreen as the skiff makes\n     a course-correction. One very bright star comes into view.\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Might interest you....\n\n     Imam moves forward. Seeing, his face lifts.\n\n                              IMAM\n               New Mecca....\n\n                              RIDDICK\n               Think a soul could get lost there?
