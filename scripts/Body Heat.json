PULLING BACK,\nwe see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense,\nblack shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda\nBeach, Florida. We're watching from across town. The\nsound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop at\nabout the same time we see the naked back and head of NED\nRACINE. We continue to PULL BACK INTO --\n\n<b>RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nRacine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small\nporch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house.\nRacine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at\nthe fire.

STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - FIRST STREET - DAY\n</b>\nRacine and Lowenstein are seated at the counter. Racine\ndrinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very\nrapidly and signals for another. This place is across\nthe street from the courthouse/police station and there\nare plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whom\nacknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods.\n\nA single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the\ndoor, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot air\nthat come in with each new patron. All of these people,\nlike the pedestrians outside the window, have stripped\ndown to essentials In the infernal heat. The lawyers all\ncarry their Jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves are\nsweaty.

FIRST STREET AND MAIN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nRacine makes his way up First to the corner of Main and\ncrosses diagonally to his building on Main. He is well-\nknown here, greeted through glass by many of the shop\nowners. The heat dominates much of the pantomimed\nconversation. Racine goes in a doorway and heads up the\nstairs to his office.\n\n<b>INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nRacine's secretary, BEVERLY, is behind the desk in the\nmodest reception room. She's a pretty girl barely past\ntwenty. She pushes some phone message slips toward Racine\nand nods toward the sofa. A middle-aged woman client,\nMRS. SINGER, sits there clutching a walking stick. Her\nface suddenly is contorted in pain. Racine glances\nmeaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitous\ncharm on Mrs. Singer.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly\n          come to the house.\n\nHe helps her up and leads her slowly to his office.\n\n<b>                         MRS.

THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds\nto the beach in search of relief. But they've been\ndisappointed. Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown\nfrom a hair dryer. Still, the nights are a trifle better\nand the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands\nand bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week.\n\nRacine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly\nwatching the passing parade. There is a free band concert\nin progress at the band shell. Racine wanders in that\ndirection.\n\n<b>EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a\nfull, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange\nprograms fluttering away as fans. People come and go\nfrequently.\n\nThe atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music\nthe band is playing now.\n\nRacine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes\nplaying over the scene with no expectations.\n\nThen, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As the\nband plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a\nsimple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moves\nwonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat.\n\nRacine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward\nhim. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes\nlowered. Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as\nthough buffeted by some force. But they do not touch.\nShe goes out onto the Beachfront walkway.\n\n<b>EXT. THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Woman, MATTY, has walked to the rail. She stands\nthere now lighting a cigarette. She presents her face\n\nto the ocean, hoping for a breeze.    We move in on her,\nwith Racine.\n\nRacine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. She\nlooks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his\nbody, then she looks back at the ocean.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              8.\n\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          You can stand here with me if you\n          want, but you'll have to agree not\n          to talk about the heat.\n\nShe looks at him, and there is something startling about\nthe directness of her gaze.

MEN'S ROOM\n</b>\nRacine comes in, snaps some paper towels from the rack\nand turns on the water. The room is full of smoke. A\nfifteen-year-old Boy is leaning against the wall. After\nlooking Racine over a second, he brings the smoking joint\nhe's been holding behind his back into view and takes a\ntoke. He nods at Racine, who nods back and stands up\nwith his wet towels. As he walks out, Racine takes a\ndeep breath.\n\n<b>EXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT\n</b>\nRacine comes out of the structure. And stops. Matty is\ngone. Racine  looks around without much hope. Finally,\nhe puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck. We\nbegin to HEAR a strange, measured thumping, and then --\n\n<b>EXT. THE BOARDWALK (82ND STREET) - DAWN\n</b>\nRacine is running. The THUMPING is the sound of Racine's\nbattered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks\nof the Boardwalk.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             12.\n\n\nRacine wears old gym shorts and a torn tee-shirt with\n\"F.S.U.\" fading from the front. The raised wooden walk\nworks its crooked way through lush, tropical vegetation,\nfirst coming close to the wide, white beach, then jutting\nback inland, swallowed by greenery, then shooting out\nagain toward the sea. Racine hits this last stretch at\ntop speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming\nsand.\n\n<b>EXT. BEACH - DAWN\n</b>\nRacine is running on the sand now, on a raised, hardened\nsection that bisects the beach. His shoes make a weird\nwhooshing SOUND each time they break the compacted surface\nand sink an inch below. The sun is just rising from the\nocean to his right, yet the day is already broiling.\nRacine's shirt is drenched. The WHOOSHING is hypnotic,\nsteady; his expression indicates that it is just this\nsound which keeps him going.\n\n<b>EXT. THE BAND SHELL/THE BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nFurther on, Racine runs by the Band Shell where he'd seen\nMatty.\n\n<b>EXT. THE PIER - DAY\n</b>\nThe THUMPING returns, as Racine runs the long, straight\npier directly out to sea, toward the rising sun. A\nlifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of\nthe pier. Racine watches it as he runs until it disappears\nbeneath him, then reappears on his right and turns out to\nsea, so that it is running beside him. Racine speeds up,\nreally kicking, racing the boat to the end of the pier.\nThe Lifeguard on board isn't even aware of Racine, but he\nbeats the runner nonetheless, then veers off to continue\nhis business.\n\nRacine pulls up, breathing hard. He walks it off a bit,\nwatching the boat, then turns and starts walking back\nalong the pier. He reaches into the waistband of his\nshorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes.\n\n<b>INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nRacine is behind the desk. Occupying the two seats in\nfront are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce.\nThey are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine of\ntheir view. Racine nods occasionally, looking from one\nto the other. But he is also looking between them, through\nthe open door out to the reception room, where his\nsecretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of\na filing cabinet. Her back is turned and her jeans are\ntight across the bottom. There's nothing especially\nprovocative about her pose. She's just there. Working\naway.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 13.\n\n\nRacine walks across his office and closes the door.   He\ngoes back to his seat. The couple continues.\n\n<b>EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT\n</b>\nAnother concert going on, a trio   of musicians. Racine\nmoves down the sidewalk away from   the audience. He looks\naround as he lights a cigarette.    She is nowhere in sight.\nRacine opens the door to his car,   a nicked-up red '64\nStingray.\n\n<b>EXT. PINEHAVEN - DAY\n</b>\nRacine drives past a neat sign --\n\n\"You are entering\n<b>PINEHAVEN\n</b>Please drive carefully\"\n\nThere's money here. Many of the homes are not visible\nfrom the street -- only their gates announce their\npresence. Those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish.\nThe Waterway appears to the left. A large white yacht\ncruises slowly by.\n\n<b>INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n</b>\nRacine sits in bed smoking a cigarette. At the mirror, a\nNurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes\nand begins attaching her cap with bobby pins.\n\n<b>INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PINEHAVEN - NIGHT\n</b>\nDark. Almost classy. The place is half full. Matty is\ndrinking at the end of the bar, her cigarettes next to\nher glass. The bar chairs near her are empty.\n\nRacine comes in, looks around, walks over and sits in the\nseat next to her. She looks up, surprised.\n\n<b>                         MATTY\n</b>          Look who's here.

Despite the night gloom,\nit's clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner\nentirely consistent with the exterior of the house. Fine\nantiques, carefully chosen fabrics, and a meticulous\nselection of accessories have given the place the look of\nan affluent home of Thirties America. And yet the overall\neffect is almost contemporary, so burnished are the woods,\nso fresh all the elements. It works.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          Just like my place.\n\nMatty gives him a searching look, then      leads   him up the\nstairs, flipping on only an occasional      light   in their\npath. In the second floor hall, Matty       moves   to the front\nof the house. Racine glances into the       gloom   that hides\nMatty's bedroom.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              19.\n\n\n<b>                           RACINE\n</b>          No help?\n\n<b>                         MATTY\n</b>          She goes home nights.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          You're not nervous alone?\n\nMatty pauses at the doors to the porch, unlocking them,\nand looks at Racine as though she barely understands the\nquestion.\n\n<b>                           MATTY\n</b>          No.\n\n<b>EXT.

There are about thirty wind chimes\nof various, lovely designs -- crystal, metal, wood hanging\nat intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning,\ncompletely encircling Matty and Racine.\n\nHalfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo. Beyond it,\nthe waterway is shimmering in the moonlight. At the edge\nof the water is a small boat house.\n\nRacine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them.\nA smile plays across her face.

She\ncloses her eyes at his touch, then moves away, as though\nby an act, of will, to the door, half opening it.\n\n<b>                         MATTY\n</b>          I think you should go now.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          I just got here.\n\n<b>                         MATTY\n</b>          You've seen them.

The wind picks up    a bit and  the TINKLING of the\nwind chimes gets louder.    And then  louder.\n\nRacine goes back up onto the porch fast.    He goes to the\nfront door and looks through the window.\n\n<b>EXT. FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT\n</b>\nRACINE'S POV. Matty is standing at the bottom of the\nstairs in the hall. She is looking directly at the front\ndoor. Frozen in the spot.\n\nRacine tries the door. It's locked. He shakes it hard,\nbut it's solid. He looks to his left. There are windows\ndown the wall there. He moves to them. They go into the\nliving room but their shutters are closed. He looks\nthrough a broken slat at Matty, who watches him from the\nsame spot, through the living room door. Racine tries\nthem. They won't budge. Racine moves to his right past\nthe front door, to the windows off the dining room. He\npushes at them as his eyes lock with Matty, who watches\nfrom the hall. The windows won't move, Racine spins and\npicks up the nearest object, a wooden rocking chair. He\nlifts it, turns and smashes the big window. Glass showers\ninto the dining room.\n\nMatty watches.    She hasn't moved.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                22.\n\n\nRacine pushes the broken window out of his way.    He comes\nin, like a violent gust of wind.\n\n<b>INT. HALL\n</b>\nRacine crosses the dark living room  fast. As he reaches\nMatty, she lifts her arms to match  his embrace. They\ncome together hard and tight. They   kiss. And kiss again.\nHer hands travel over his body, as  though she's wanted\nthem there for a long time.\n\nThey turn once slowly along the wall, into the dimness of\nthe central hall.

There are more wind chimes on the    second\nfloor of the verandah, which is off this room, and   Racine\nis listening to their TINKLING. Racine looks over    in\nthat direction.\n\nRACINE'S POV. The moonlit, sheer white curtains on the\nwindow roil to a light breeze. Racine's gaze travels\nover the luxurious bedroom; here too, it is in the Thirties\nstyle. Their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a\ndivan and on the floor nearby. A delicate fern sways in\nthe wind. Finally, he is looking at a lovely writing\ndesk against the far wall. Some tissue-thin stationery\nflaps in the breeze, kept in place by the weight of a\npen. Then, as he looks, the paper stops flapping and the\nchimes gradually STOP TINKLING. Racine looks toward the\nwindow. It is still open, but the air had died.\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               23.\n\n\nThe curtains hang still.\n\nRacine's face.

Now nothing's going\n          to be the same anymore.\n\nFROM ABOVE THEM, we see them framed by the bed.\n\n<b>EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nNear the front gate of  the Walker place, a heavyset, middle-\naged woman, BETTY, THE  WALKER'S HOUSEKEEPER, has been\nwaiting on a bus stop  bench. Now she lifts her tired\nbody to board a public  bus.\n\nDown the Street, just around a corner, Racine watches her\ngo. He puts the Stingray in gear and drives to the\nWalkers.\n\n<b>EXT. WALKERS' BOAT HOUSE - SUNSET\n</b>\nLights are going on across the waterway, sending shimmers\ntoward the boat house.\n\n<b>INT. WALKERS' BOAT HOUSE - SUNSET\n</b>\nWe're looking out a dusty window at the waterway. We\nHEAR Racine and Matty disentangle and roll apart o.s.,\nRacine grunting his exhaustion. After a moment, Racine\nrises up into frame, looking happy. He looks down to\nwhere he was and rests against the wall.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          I like this place.

A huge FOG HORN fills\nthe air from not far way.\n\n<b>EXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG. The Cadillac,\nlights out, rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden\ndelivery driveway.\n\n<b>INT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT\n</b>\nRacine, carrying only a flashlight, has made his way to\nthe supply area he visited before. His beam probes dark\ncorners, responds to random CREAKING. Satisfied that he\nis alone, he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the\nhole in the wall which it hid. He brings out Teddy's\nincendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle\nof the room.\n\n<b>EXT. \"THE BREAKERS\" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nRacine grunts under the weight of Edmund's corpse, flung\nover his back.

He adjusts the plastic sheet\nso that Edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall.\nRacine gathers his strength and half-lifts, half-drags\nthe body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a\ntwisted, double-headed monster. His flashlight glows\nfrom ahead at his destination.\n\nIN THE SUPPLY AREA, Racine has dropped Edmund's body over\nsome tipped shelves. Now he lifts the  heavy ceiling beam\nhe spotted earlier. He has to change  its angle only two\nfeet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmund's head.\n\nRacine walks over to the incendiary device. He pulls out\nthe lever and straightens up. As he does he looks down a\nconnecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up\nthe flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that\nhallway.\n\nAT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt,\nbreathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible,\nsweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror\nattached to the wall. Racine looks at himself a long\nmoment and the tension seems to drain away...\n\nSomeone speaks in the shadows!\n<b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                75.\n\n\nRacine jumps and spins toward the sound,   which is only a\nlittle more than a MOAN.

He wears an old baseball    cap.\n\nRacine looks at him a long time, trying to decide what to\ndo.

He has the Bum\nwith him, grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and\nthe seat of his pants. Racine is forcing the Bum to run\nalong with him. The Bum is mightily confused, not least\nby the fact that Racine has jammed the baseball cap all\nthe way down over his nose -- he can see nothing.

It forbids an inheritance to\n          be passed down indefinitely for\n          generations. Many general\n          practitioner lawyers don't fully\n          understand it. It doesn't come up\n          much for them, because wills this\n          complex are usually handled by estate\n          departments in larger firms.

I\n          spotted the problem right away, but\n          since Edmund's intent was clear, I\n          thought it in everyone's best interest\n          to try and get the will admitted\n          into probate anyway, even though it\n          was technically incorrect. I knew\n          that a probate judge in Miami would\n          spot the mistake right away. That's\n          all they do all day, they're expert.\n          So I thought I'd bring it up here to\n          Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had\n          the residence here -- and see if I\n          could get lucky with a judge who\n          didn't know estate law quite so\n          well...\n                  (dryly, he can't\n                   resist)\n          Perhaps find one with the same kind\n          of training as Mr. Racine.\n\nRacine watches him, his mind racing ahead too fast to\nbother being insulted.

It's not just\nthat he's very tired. The hardness is going out of his\nlook. As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear,\nhe begins to lose faith in his view of the world.

And there's only\n          one person in the world who knows\n          the truth.\n<b>                         (MORE)\n</b><b>\n</b>    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                118.\n\n\n<b>                         RACINE (CONT'D)\n</b>                 (he leans in)\n          And then just when Matty's got me on\n          the line, when she's finally going\n          to collect, that one person shows\n          up. That girl. Finds her. And\n          threatens to expose her. So Matty\n          starts paying her off. Maybe she\n          even promises to cut her in on\n          Edmunds' money. Now she's got to\n          share it with two people.\n\nRacine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though it\nwere all there for Grace to see.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          But when Matty sees a way to get rid\n          of both of them at once. A way to\n          solve all her problems and get clear,\n          with no one looking for her. At the\n          boathouse. You find two bodies, me\n          and this girl. Two killers dead.\n          Case closed.\n\nOscar isn't buying.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          You can't find the money, can you,\n          Oscar? Doesn't that tell you\n          something?\n\n<b>                            GRACE\n</b>          It tells    me she moved it and we can't\n          find it.    And that don't mean shit.\n          It could    be sittin' in any bank in\n          the world    waiting for a dead lady to\n          come for    it.\n\nRacine, calmer now, shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n<b>                         GRACE\n</b>          Do you hear what you're saying? It's\n          crazy. This Matty would've had to\n          been one quick, smart broad.\n\nRacine confirms Grace's fears with a look that can only\nbe called half-crazed. There's the glimmer of a rueful\nsmile.\n\n<b>                         RACINE\n</b>          Oscar, don't you understand?

He looks at\nRacine without hope.\n\n<b>                         GRACE\n</b>          Racine, you got to face something.\n          You killed Edmund Walker, man.

And no matter how you want\n          to figure it, you ain't bringin'\n          either of 'em back to life.\n\nGrace gives him a long look, then hangs up the phone. He\nstands up and walks away.

RACINE'S CELL BLOCK - DAY\n</b>\nRacine, bearded now, comes to the front of his cell to\nget his mail. A Trustee hands through a book-size manila\nenvelope, which has been neatly opened by the prison\nauthorities. Racine looks at the return address and becomes\nvery intense. He sits on his cot and slides out a book. A\nletter is clipped to the front. Racine scans it quickly\nand begins looking through the book.\n\nIt is an old high school yearbook. Racine's fingers are\nshaking slightly as they leaf quickly past black and white\nscenes of youthful innocence among the Wheaton High School\nCougars of 1966.\n\nHe reaches the individual pictures of the seniors and hi\nhurries through the O's and R's to the T's.\n\nRacine's eyes are darting over the pages. Suddenly they\nstop. He has found her entry. We see it too --\n\n<b>MARY ANN TYLER\n</b>Home Economics \"Matty\"\n<b>TRI-Y 29 39 4. CHORUS\n</b>Ambition -- \"To Graduate\"\n\nThe picture is not great. The pretty face is a little\ncheap-looking. It is not the Matty he knew. It is her\nfriend from the back verandah, Mary Ann.\n\nRacine's eyes dart. He thinks. Then, he flips back a few\npages. He finds what he wants --\n\n<b>MARY ANN SIMPSON\n</b>English\n<b>TRI-Y 2, 3, 4; CHORUS 2, 3, 4\n</b><b>HOMECOMING PRINCESS 3, 4; SWIMMING 2, 3\n</b>Ambition-- \"To be rich and live in an exotic land.\"\n\nWe're very close on the type of her ambition when we pan\nup the page to her smiling face.

We're moving in on it. Closer. Closer.\nAnd then through it --\n\nTo her real face, this Matty, this Mary Ann, alive and\nfine in the sun of --\n\n<b>EXT.
