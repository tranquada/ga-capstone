ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY                           \n</b>\n     A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field\n     carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in\n     progress.\n\n<b>A1   ON THE FIELD                                                            \n</b>\n     Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark-\n     skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned\n     Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised\n     for the next pitch.\n\n     CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZ\u00daCAR/SUGAR - 19,\n     lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the\n     oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his\n     chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts\n     his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES\n     the ball toward the plate.\n\n     THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball\n     slams inside.\n\n<b>                           UMPIRE\n</b>               Strike three!\n\n     The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's\n     overpowering fastball.\n\n     FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH\n     REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS.\n\n     BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in\n     Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS\n     clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which\n     read 92 and 93 MPH.\n\n     As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE\n     (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside\n     fastball.\n\n     The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and\n     home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and\n     first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands\n     between them and the runners reach base safely.\n\nB1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1\n     ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and\n     SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.\n<b>\n</b>                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   2.\n\n\nC1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1\n     kicks the dirt.\n\n     Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a\n     tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the\n     dirt.\n\n     Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry\n     fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with\n     a friendly, but authoritative, grin.\n\n     He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through\n     it, getting nothing but air.\n\n<b>2    INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                   2\n</b>\n     The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for\n     their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is\n     friendly and playful as players tease each other across the\n     tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and\n     ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.\n\n<b>                          MARCOS\n</b>              Check out Sugar...

Rock solid.\n\n     For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE\n     uniforms by their BLACK \"tryout\" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it\n     is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their\n     last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his\n     plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.\n\n<b>                          PEDRO\n</b>              Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.\n\n     A few of the guys LAUGH.\n\n<b>                          MIGUEL\n</b>                   (to Pedro)\n              If you hustled half as much as him,\n              maybe you'd be hungry too.\n\n     The other guys \"ohhhh\" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel\n     exchange subtle grins.\n<b>\n</b>                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     3.\n\n\n<b>3   INT.

Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice\n    that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.\n\n    Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec\n    room down a hall, and into...\n\n<b>5   THE WEIGHT ROOM                                                    5\n</b>\n    ...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in\n    thought.

Their\n    AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby.\n\n    Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids,\n    whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively.\n\n    Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.\n\n<b>                         RUDY\n</b>             What'd you tell him?\n\n<b>                         ALVAREZ\n</b>             I told him to grip the ball more\n             gently.

Miguel\nstares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher,\ndetermined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation.\nDelivers.\n\nMisses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more\nbad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather\naround, some laughing, until...\n\n...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air,\nlanding centered in Jose's mitt.\n\nThe other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares\nstraight ahead.

Just like old times.\n<b>\n</b>                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     113.\n\n\n<b>233   IN THE DUGOUT                                                      233\n</b>\n      Miguel takes a seat as TEAMMATES pass through the frame and pat\n      him on the back.\n\n      The SOUND FADES LOW as we start a SLOW ZOOM IN on Miguel. He\n      takes in the moment as we get closer, and his smile gives way to\n      a beat of quiet introspection. Hold.\n\n      He looks out across the field.   CLAPS for encouragement.\n\n<b>                                                          FADE OUT.\n</b><b>\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Sugar.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Sugar</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Anna Boden\" title=\"Scripts by Anna Boden\">Anna Boden</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ryan Fleck\" title=\"Scripts by Ryan Fleck\">Ryan Fleck</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Sugar Script.html#comments\" title=\"Sugar comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:17:31.150931"}
