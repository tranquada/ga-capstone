ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY                           \n\n     A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field\n     carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in\n     progress.\n\nA1   ON THE FIELD                                                            \n\n     Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark-\n     skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned\n     Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised\n     for the next pitch.\n\n     CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZ\u00daCAR/SUGAR - 19,\n     lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the\n     oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his\n     chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts\n     his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES\n     the ball toward the plate.\n\n     THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball\n     slams inside.\n\n                           UMPIRE\n               Strike three!\n\n     The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's\n     overpowering fastball.\n\n     FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH\n     REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS.\n\n     BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in\n     Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS\n     clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which\n     read 92 and 93 MPH.\n\n     As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE\n     (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside\n     fastball.\n\n     The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and\n     home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and\n     first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands\n     between them and the runners reach base safely.\n\nB1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1\n     ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and\n     SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards.\n\n                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   2.\n\n\nC1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1\n     kicks the dirt.\n\n     Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a\n     tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the\n     dirt.\n\n     Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry\n     fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with\n     a friendly, but authoritative, grin.\n\n     He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through\n     it, getting nothing but air.\n\n2    INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                   2\n\n     The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for\n     their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is\n     friendly and playful as players tease each other across the\n     tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and\n     ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert.\n\n                          MARCOS\n              Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty\n              pounds in two months; now he's going\n              for twenty more.\n\n                          MIGUEL\n                   (mouth full of food)\n              All muscle, baby. Rock solid.\n\n     For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE\n     uniforms by their BLACK \"tryout\" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it\n     is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their\n     last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his\n     plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat.\n\n                          PEDRO\n              Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere.\n\n     A few of the guys LAUGH.\n\n                          MIGUEL\n                   (to Pedro)\n              If you hustled half as much as him,\n              maybe you'd be hungry too.\n\n     The other guys \"ohhhh\" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel\n     exchange subtle grins.\n\n                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     3.\n\n\n3   INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY                                  3\n\n    Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated\n    English instructor, SE\u00d1OR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English\n    BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he\n    enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n             Fly ball.\n\n                           CLASS\n             Fly ball.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n             Line drive.\n\n                           CLASS\n             Line drive.\n\n                         SANCHEZ\n             Ground ball.\n\n                         CLASS\n             Ground ball.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n             Home run!\n\n                           CLASS\n             Hone rone!\n\n    CLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words.\n\n4   INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT                                  4\n\n    It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set\n    watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in\n    Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice\n    that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner.\n\n    Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec\n    room down a hall, and into...\n\n5   THE WEIGHT ROOM                                                    5\n\n    ...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in\n    thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer,\n    then leans back onto the bench.\n\n    TRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses.\n\n                                                        FADE OUT.\n\n                     Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      4.\n\n\n6   EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DAY                                            6\n\n    The Kansas City Director of Minor League Operations, RUDY\n    HUBBARD (white, 40s), watches a TRYOUT SESSION, where TWO SKINNY\n    TEENS in worn street clothes pitch to uniformed catchers. Their\n    AGENT talks on a cell phone nearby.\n\n    Alvarez, the academy director, approaches one of the kids,\n    whispers in his ear. The kid smiles tentatively.\n\n    Alvarez joins Rudy and they speak in English.\n\n                         RUDY\n             What'd you tell him?\n\n                         ALVAREZ\n             I told him to grip the ball more\n             gently. Like a tit.\n\n    They both crack up.\n\n    FROM THE TRYOUT MOUND. The kid looks over to the two men pow-\n    wowing about him. He breathes in, nervous...\n\n7   BATTING CAGE - MINUTES LATER                                        7\n\n    Pedro, sweating hard, takes a few cuts, but only seems to be\n    hitting weak ground balls and foul tips.\n\n                         ALVAREZ\n             Pedro Berroa. Third year.     Hasn't\n             developed like we hoped.\n\n                         RUDY\n             How much he sign for?\n\n                           ALVAREZ\n             Forty-five.\n\n                         RUDY\n             Jesus. These kids keep getting more\n             expensive. How much did you sign for\n             back in the day?\n\n                          ALVAREZ\n             3000.   When I was fifteen.\n\n    Rudy smiles and moves on.    Alvarez follows.   Pedro watches the\n    men as they walk away.\n\n8   BULL PEN MOUNDS - MINUTES LATER                                     8\n\n    Alvarez and Rudy approach a PITCHING COACH instructing Salvador.\n    Miguel warms up next to him.\n\n                Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     5.\n\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n        Salvador Torres. Been practicing with\n        the team for almost a week. Still raw,\n        but he's got a lot of potential.\n\n                    RUDY\n        We gonna sign him?\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n        Soon. Soon. We want to play it low-\n        key, see what his agent says.\n\n                    RUDY\n        How much you think?\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n        They've gotten two offers from other\n        clubs. Agent says they were around a\n        hundred.\n\nRudy raises his eyebrows.\n\n                      ALVAREZ\n             (firm)\n        He's good.\n\nRudy looks over to Miguel.\n\n                    RUDY\n        What about him?\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n        Miguel Santos. Great arm. We signed\n        him two years ago for fifteen.\n\nMiguel fires in a pitch.    Rudy nods, impressed.\n\n                      RUDY\n        Good deal.    He throw any junk?\n\n                   ALVAREZ\n             (in Spanish)\n        Sugar!\n\nMiguel looks over, sees the American with Alvarez.\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n        Show us your curve.\n\nMiguel nods, nervous, focuses. He pitches.    The ball curves\nvery subtly over the plate for a strike.\n\n                     RUDY\n        Not bad.   Mind if I try something?\n\n                 Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    6.\n\n\nMiguel looks back to the men.\n\n                    RUDY\n        Hey, kid, do you mind?   May I?\n\nMiguel stares blankly at Rudy, not understanding.\n\n                    ALVAREZ\n             (in Spanish)\n        Give him the ball.\n\nMiguel hands Rudy the ball, and Rudy demonstrates how to handle\na knuckle curve ball, which looks strangely unorthodox, with the\nindex finger tucked against the baseball.\n\n                    RUDY\n        Spike curve. Gives you more rotation,\n        more movement.\n             (hands Miguel the ball)\n        You try.\n\nMiguel struggles to emulate Rudy's grip, so Rudy maneuvers his\nfingers into the correct position. Alvarez laughs.\n\n                     ALVAREZ\n        Vamos!   Let's go! Pitch it!\n\nMiguel looks over to his catcher, Jose. Winds up the next\npitch, and soars it 5 feet wide of the mark.\n\nRudy and Alvarez laugh.   Miguel looks back over his shoulder.\n\n                    RUDY\n        It's okay, son, these things take time.\n        You'll figure it out.\n\nRudy pats Miguel on the back and walks off with Alvarez. Miguel\nstares at them hard as they go. He turns back to his catcher,\ndetermined, squeezes the ball in spike curve formation.\nDelivers.\n\nMisses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more\nbad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather\naround, some laughing, until...\n\n...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air,\nlanding centered in Jose's mitt.\n\nThe other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares\nstraight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.\n\n                       Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     7.\n\n\n9     INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY                                       9\n\n      Sr. Sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard, reading off lines\n      of a scripted ENGLISH DIALOGUE for the class to repeat. The\n      class' version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n               I want to talk to you.\n\n                           CLASS\n               I want talk to you.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n               Your performance in the mound is not as\n               good as last year.

Maybe mechanic.\n\n                           SANCHEZ\n               I want to give you a chance.   It is up\n               to you...\n\n      CLOSE ON Miguel focused on the baseball in his hand. He\n      practices his knuckle curve grip, not participating in the\n      lesson.\n\n                           CLASS\n               I want to give you a chance.

He exits\n      past the gate, waving goodbye to the SECURITY GUARD.\n\nA10   Beyond the manicured lawns and landscaped gardens of the          A10\n      Academy, Miguel passes through the overgrown, undeveloped land\n      where neighborhood CHILDREN play among grazing goats. He\n      continues down the dirt road towards a paved highway in the\n      distance, as bachata music fuels the sound track, and carries\n      over the following...\n\n                       Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     8.\n\n\n11    INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                              11\n\n      Thick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. CLOSE ON\n      Miguel staring out the bus window. On his way home, he\n      passes...\n\nA11   --half-clothed children flying a homemade kite.                    A11\n\nB11   --a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top.

STREET - SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS -   DAY                         12\n\n      Miguel hops off the bus with his duffel, climbs the pedestrian\n      walkway passing over dozens of rusty railroad cars used for\n      transporting sugarcane to the refinery. We PAN Miguel across\n      the bridge, revealing burning smokestacks in the distance.\n\n13    EXT. SIDE STREET - MINUTES LATER                                   13\n\n      Modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated\n      tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig\n      roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers\n      sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos\n      to Miguel, who smiles back.\n\n      Local KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with\n      makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard.\n      They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block,\n      SHOUTING his name.\n\n      As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl,\n      ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles.\n\n      With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips\n      his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the\n      balls, then run off to play.\n\n      Miguel approaches Erica.   She puts down her water bucket, gives\n      Miguel a hug.\n\n                           MIGUEL\n               How are you, sis?\n\n                           ERICA\n               Any news about the States?\n\n                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   9.\n\n\n                          MIGUEL\n              Is that all you have to say?\n\n     Miguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her\n     towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling\n     paint and a rusted aluminum roof. On the lot next to their\n     house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the\n     others on the block.\n\n14   INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT                                         14\n\n     Miguel and Erica enter the house, where their brother LUIS (7)\n     watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the\n     middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. The reception is still\n     crappy, though.\n\n     Miguel's grandmother, ABUELA, sits upright on her mattress in\n     the corner of the room.\n\n                          MIGUEL\n              Hello, Abuela. You're looking\n              beautiful.\n\n     She smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug.\n     Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open.\n\n                          MIGUEL\n              What's up my people?

At first cautious, Miguel\n      and his partner ease closer, until Miguel's hands are on her\n      hips, leading her in rhythm to the hip-hop jam, while mixing in\n      some Latin moves as well.\n\n      As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several\n      local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork.\n      But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in\n      particular, who...\n\n      ...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face.\n\n                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     52.\n\n\n                           JACKASS\n                    (barely audible)\n               Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle.\n\n      Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate\n      vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them,\n      and...\n\n      ...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere\n      because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in\n      their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other,\n      though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific.\n\n      Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything\n      serious starts. They all hustle out to...\n\n102   EXT.

Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing\n      with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the\n      Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey\n      head under one arm.\n\n      Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first\n      start.

He takes a moment, crosses\n      himself. Play ball.\n\n      Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first\n      pitch high for a ball.\n\n      When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where...\n\n      ...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to\n      the field in choice box seats.\n\n      He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two.\n      Same for the third. And forth.\n\n      The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES.\n\n108   INT.

Hailing all the way from the\n               Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the\n               club with his power during Spring\n               Training.

More APPLAUSE.\n\n110   IN THE DUGOUT                                                    110\n\n      Orlando hands him his first strikeout ball.

He and\n      Orlando greet Miguel on the mound.\n\n                            STU\n                Good game, kid.

He takes the ball from Miguel with a smile, but\n      Miguel doesn't move, still reluctant to leave the mound.\n\n      As the FANS begin to cheer his stellar debut...\n\n                           STU\n               You hear that? It's for you, kid.\n\n      Orlando smiles, pats Miguel on the butt, and Miguel finally\n      starts his slow walk off the field. As we follow him off, the\n      FANS rise to their feet and Miguel approaches the dugout to a\n      standing ovation. On his way in, he's greeted by his teammates\n      with congratulatory high-fives.\n\n      AT THIRD Jorge stares at the dirt, frustrated by his misplay.\n\n115   EXT.

The\n      runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet.\n\n      Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him.

He lands gingerly on his right ankle,\n      makes a face.\n\n      Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as\n      he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no.\n\n                      Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       66.\n\n\n                           STU\n               All right, kid.

First night off the DL, and not\n                looking so sharp.\n\n       The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th.\n\n       Miguel glances out of the corner of his eye to...\n\n       THE DUGOUT\n\n       ...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard.\n\n       MIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way\n       out to the mound. Miguel glances back to the bullpen, where\n       Salvador is warming up.\n\n       Stu signals for Salvador to come in, and we follow Miguel off\n       the field to scattered applause.\n\nA148   IN THE RADIO BOOTH Jack Jefferies continues his play-by-play ofA148\n       the game.\n\n                            JACK JEFFERIES\n                Sutton makes the call to pull Santos\n                here in the 4th, bringing in rookie\n                reliever, Salvador Torres for his\n                Bridgetown debut.\n\nB148   IN THE DUGOUT.

Salvador warms up, looking a little freaked.\n\n       Players and fans marvel over Sal's unorthodox, side-armed\n       delivery. His form is reminiscent of A's legend, Dennis\n       Eckersly, but without the grace.\n\n       MIGUEL peaks through his towel at the action...\n\n       ON THE FIELD.

ON THE CAR\n      RADIO, we can hear a news report of a suicide bombing in Iraq.\n      Helen turns it down.\n\n                           HELEN\n               You started dropping your arm in the\n               third.

Salvador jokes around with Orlando and Ed about\n      whether Dominican or Venezuelan girls are better.\n\n151   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                          151\n\n      Miguel tries to sleep, while Salvador watches \"Sponge Bob\" on\n      the Spanish channel.\n\n152   EXT.

Out of nowhere, Stu mimes the chicken\n      walk to Sal, and they both laugh.\n\n153   EXT.

He swears to himself as he sprints over to back\n      up home plate where the runner scores easily.\n\n155   INT. VISITORS' CLUBHOUSE - NIGHT                                155\n\n      Miguel storms into the empty clubhouse, grabs a bat from the\n      wall rack, and smashes a water dispenser unit to the ground,\n      spilling water everywhere. As he observes the mess, his\n      breathing steadies, and...\n\n      He glances over to the entrance, where the clubhouse manager\n      stares at him, disapproving.\n\n156   INT.

But you need to learn self-\n               control. Can you understand what I'm\n               saying? You need to learn that your\n               actions have consequences.

Think about channeling that\n               frustration you're feeling onto the\n               field. Into practice.

I've\n               been on the mound; I've played through\n               pain. I've been in your exact\n               situation before. I've struggled\n               too...

He touches his\n       cross, whispers a prayer to himself.\n\n       Winds up, throws, and...\n\n       THUD!\n\n       ...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the\n       old days.

Miguel fires his first pitch\n       over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop.\n       Orlando motions for him to calm down.\n\n       The next pitch is closer, but still high.\n\n       And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh.\n\n       Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart\n       is racing.\n\nA164   IN THE RADIO BOOTH                                                A164\n\n                            JACK JEFFERIES\n                Top of the fifth and Santos is showing\n                some control issues.

He whispers a prayer to\n       himself, grabs the ball in his spike curve grip, and...\n\n       ...his next pitch is ROCKED to deep left field.\n\n       Miguel immediately lowers his head, unable to watch. We HOLD on\n       his anguished reaction, as the hitter circles the bases.\n\n       STU shakes his head in disappointment.\n\nC164   FROM THE BULLPEN, Salvador watches, concerned.

It's a mess.\n\n      The sound FADES TO SILENCE and the image blends to SLO-MO again.\n      There's something poetic about a bunch of men in child-like\n      baseball uniforms, screaming at each other in silence.\n\n      Miguel looks around, perhaps recognizing this for himself...\n      Hold, until...\n\n      ...he calmly walks off the field, leaving the chaos behind.\n\n165   INT.

Earl sits at the other\n      end, sipping some tea, while Helen does dishes at the sink.\n      The mood is uncomfortably tense. Nobody says a word, until\n      Miguel musters up the courage.\n\n                            MIGUEL\n               I'm sorry.\n\n      Helen turns off the faucet, turns around. Earl methodically\n      sets down his mug, stands up, and crosses to Miguel.

BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - COACHES' OFFICE - EVENING         167\n\n      Stu addresses Miguel before the game. Though his words are\n      encouraging, his tone is detached, cold.

Game\n      over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out\n      onto the field.\n\n      As the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on\n      the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at\n      peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN\n      with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the\n      dugout. Hold.\n\n170   INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                170\n\n      Miguel grabs a slip of paper from his nightstand.

BUS - DAY                                                    174\n\n      Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty\n      seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and\n      whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across\n      the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him.\n\n      He shoots her a cautious smile.\n\n175   INT. MOVING BUS - DAY/EVENING                                     175\n\n      Miguel stares, wide-eyed, out the window at the shifting\n      landscapes, daytime into evening...\n\n      --cornstalks.\n\n                       Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    88.\n\n\n      --bridges and rivers.\n\n      --city lights.\n\n      He sleeps against the window, his Clemente book open on his lap.\n\n176   INT.

He sits up\n      straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the\n      distance.\n\n177   INT. TIMES SQUARE SUBWAY STATION                                  177\n\n      Morning COMMUTERS push past Miguel, as he looks around, lost in\n      the cacophony of the swirling rush hour environment.\n\n      He locates a giant subway map on the wall, the various subway\n      lines reaching into the outer boroughs like colorful tentacles.\n      His eyes scan the map, and we follow his finger up the green\n      line's numbered stations, stopping on 161ST/YANKEE STADIUM.\n\n      Miguel smiles.\n\n      AT THE TURNSTILES. Miguel inches forward, observes people\n      passing through after swiping cards. He notices a line behind a\n      Metrocard vending machine nearby.\n\n178   AT THE MACHINE - SECONDS LATER                                    178\n\n      Fortunately, there is a Spanish option, so after a few touches\n      and BEEPS, he's got his card.\n\n179   AT THE TURNSTILE                                                  179\n\n      He swipes the card, tries to pass through, but the turnstile\n      won't budge. He studies the message: \"SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS\n      TURNSTILE\", but can't make sense of it. Miguel tries again,\n      this time very slowly, but still can't get through.\n\n      An IMPATIENT COMMUTER behind him SIGHS loudly.\n\n      Miguel steps out of the way, let's the commuter pass.\n\n      After the commuter goes through, Miguel tries again.\n\n180   INT. SUBWAY PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL                                     180\n\n      As Miguel strolls through the underground hallway that connects\n      the various Times Square subway lines, he sees...\n\n      --a TEAM OF BREAKDANCERS performing for tips.\n\n                        Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   89.\n\n\n      --billboard ads for movies, music, dermatologists, Mets\n      baseball, etc.\n\n      --a HOMELESS MAN passed out on the ground.\n\n      --a WOMAN selling a random collection of objects: VHS tapes,\n      batteries, a used blender...\n\n181   INT.

He stands, looks out the window as the train passes\n      Yankee Stadium.\n\n182   EXT. 167TH ST. - THE BRONX     - DAY                              182\n\n      Miguel descends from the elevated subway station, glances\n      around. The atmosphere is immediately more familiar, as PEOPLE\n      walk by speaking Spanish; MERENGUE blasts out of an open\n      apartment window; Dominican flags hang from others.\n\n      Miguel paces up the block, looking for something.    He smiles\n      when he finds...\n\n      ...El Restaurante Caribe. A HELP WANTED sign (in English and\n      Spanish) hangs in the window.\n\n183   INT.

He looks up at the park's grand exterior\n      with wonder. Approaches to get a closer look.\n\n      The Stadium is closed today, so Miguel struggles to catch a\n      glimpse of the field through an iron fence. He grabs hold of\n      the bars, attempts to climb just enough to get a better view,\n      but...\n\n                            SECURITY GUARD\n                     (in English)\n                You wanta see the inside, you gotta buy\n                a ticket, pal.\n\n                           MIGUEL\n                     (jumping down)\n                Sorry.\n\n                       Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   91.\n\n\n187    EXT.

He\n       stares off blankly, preoccupied with other things.\n\nA188   EXT.

PARADISE HOTEL LOBBY                                         188\n\n       Miguel sidesteps a nodding JUNKY on his way to the front desk,\n       approaches the toothless Russian clerk, NIKOLAI (late 50s).\n\n                            MIGUEL\n                One room.\n\n                            NIKOLAI\n                For how long?\n\n                            MIGUEL\n                I don't know.\n\n                            NIKOLAI\n                Two hundred a week.

The name of the calling card is AL\u00d3 MAM\u00c1!\n\n                            NIKOLAI\n                Two hundred now.\n\n       Miguel reaches for the calling card.\n\n                            MIGUEL\n                This also please.\n\n189    INT.

Miguel\n       makes brief eye contact with the woman, RAQUEL. She smiles.\n\n190    INT.

It's quiet, until...\n\n      KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\n\n      Miguel flinches.    Then slowly cracks open the door to find...\n\n      ...Raquel standing before him with a small leather duffel bag.\n\n                     Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   103.\n\n\n                           RAQUEL\n                    (handing him the bag)\n               Love, keep this in your room for me.\n               Just a few hours.

He sets it on\n      his bed, stares at it. After a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs\n      it under the bed, out of sight.\n\n      He sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears\n      SHOUTING from the hall. Again, he goes to the door, listens.\n\n      Another MAN POUNDS on Raquel's door, SCREAMING in Ukrainian,\n      while Nikolai YELLS at the man in English, though Miguel can't\n      make out exactly what's going on. The shouting intensifies\n      until a SCUFFLE breaks out. A woman SCREAMS. Miguel reaches\n      for the door handle, but stops himself.\n\n      He steps into his BATHROOM, shuts the door, sits on the toilet.\n      The muffled SHOUTING continues.

You know him?\n\n      Miguel shakes his head, no.\n\n                           OSVALDO\n               You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican\n               first baseman ever. But that's not why\n               he's my favorite player... Back when he\n               first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing\n               in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas.\n               So the story goes, one day before a\n               game, Vic stops into this diner for\n               lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he\n               knew very little English. Didn't even\n               notice the \"whites only\" sign hanging\n               in the window. And Vic was Black. I\n               looked him up on Google. I mean Black\n               like you. So he sits down at the\n               counter and the little waitress comes\n               up to big Vic and says, \"I'm sorry, we\n               don't serve colored people.\"\n\n      Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella\n      eagerly await what comes next.\n\n                           OSVALDO\n               So he leans close to the waitress,\n               tells her in his best English, \"That's\n               okay, I don't eat colored people.\"\n\n      After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure.   Osvaldo\n      does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.\n\n                        Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   109.\n\n\n229    INT.

And delivers.\n\n              Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       112.\n\n\nThe ball is SMACKED toward third, where Jorge makes an awkward\nlunge for the ball, manages to stop it with his foot. By the\ntime he gets his hand on it, the RUNNER has made it to first.\n\nThe fans and some of the players laugh at Jorge's ugly mistake.\n\n                    OLD MAN HECKLER\n             (from the stands)\n        This ain't soccer!

Looks back to the runner on second. Comes to the set\nposition, and...\n\n...floats in a vicious, swooping, knuckle curve, that causes the\nbatter to flinch out of the way, before breaking back over the\nplate for...\n\n                    UMPIRE\n        Strike three!\n\nAll the fans and players in attendance go NUTS over the awesome\npitch, as we follow Miguel off the field to a mini-standing\novation.
