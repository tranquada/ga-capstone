She stands on a tiny\r\n\r\n    KARAOKE STAGE\r\n\r\n    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.\r\n\r\n    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke\r\n    version of \"SONG TO BE DETERMINED.\" What Kate lacks in talent\r\n    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    At a table near the stage is --\r\n\r\n    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *\r\n    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps\r\n    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --\r\n\r\n    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *\r\n    who sings along with --\r\n\r\n    -- the small but energetic CROWD.\r\n\r\n    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points\r\n    to Charlie and Owen.

A\r\n          preppy, bitchy girl. Diane\r\n          Court...that was her name. He loved\r\n          her so much that he went with her\r\n          because she had a fellowship or\r\n          something. He gave up being a\r\n          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *\r\n              (sad)\r\n          And she dumped him.\r\n                                                         4.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation\r\nto hear her response, which is --\r\n\r\n                    FEMALE BARTENDER\r\n              (to Owen)\r\n          You kickbox?\r\n\r\n                    OWEN\r\n              (caught in the headlights)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\nAnd...that's all Owen's got.\r\n\r\n                    KATE\r\n              (jumping in)\r\n          And he teaches kids at the\r\n          kickboxing studio.

I had\r\n          amazing times drinking, dancing,\r\n          and laughing...feeling like the\r\n          most adorable, charming girl in the\r\n          world.

But it didn't.\r\n              (beat)\r\n          My marriage fell apart. I got fired\r\n          from my job. And that shit happened\r\n          SOBER!

Another shitty\r\n          slogan I've heard in the rooms is\r\n          that when you're sober for a bit\r\n          and drink again \"the disease waits\r\n          for you, picks up where it left\r\n          off.\"\r\n              (beat)\r\n          I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE\r\n          those slogans.

And that person is a pretty\r\n          big asshole. Well, unless you want\r\n          to give me drugs or buy me drinks --\r\n          then that person is awesome.\r\n\r\nPeople knowingly LAUGH.\r\n\r\n                    KATE (CONT'D)\r\n          I wasn't happy being the \"good-time\r\n          girl,\" though.

I live alone. I'm\r\n               bored a lot more. I have a job that\r\n               pays a lot less.\r\n                   (beat)\r\n               I'm thankful for the program -- for\r\n               my friends in here who took the\r\n               time to help me and give a shit\r\n               about me.\r\n\r\n     Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             *\r\n\r\n                         KATE (CONT'D)\r\n               There are people that used to be a\r\n               part of my life that I miss -- a\r\n               lot -- but...\r\n                   (long beat)\r\n               ...I'm really grateful for this\r\n               boring new life of mine.\r\n\r\n     Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n72   INT.
