At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman\r\n          - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two\r\n          dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski\r\n          boots.\r\n\r\n<b>                         LEVI\r\n</b>          My name is Wittold Levi, my\r\n          friends call me Witt - and I'm\r\n          the project manager for eXistenZ.\r\n          I recognize some familiar faces -\r\n          that's all right, that's all\r\n          right.

Could it really be?\r\n\r\n<b>                         LEVI\r\n</b>          Yes, it is. The world's greatest\r\n          game designer is here, in person,\r\n          to lead you, the first test\r\n          enclave, through her newest\r\n          creation, eXistenZ by Antenna...\r\n          The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed,\r\n          murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees.\r\n\r\n<b>                         LEVI\r\n</b>          I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess\r\n          herself - Allegra Geller!\r\n          Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it\r\n          until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to\r\n          now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security\r\n          guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an\r\n          electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as\r\n          Ted Pikul (rhymes with \"Michael\", not with \"pickle\"), and we\r\n          will see more of him later.\r\n          As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the\r\n          crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part\r\n          like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own\r\n          personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais\r\n          like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog.\r\n          Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is\r\n          bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she\r\n          speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          The world of games is in a kind\r\n          of a trance.

COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          A SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais\r\n          and are fitted with their game gear:\r\n          The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open\r\n          the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside,\r\n          resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like\r\n          living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods.\r\n          Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player\r\n          UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot\r\n          connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted,\r\n          translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below\r\n          the surface.\r\n          The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to\r\n          receive communion.\r\n          The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases.\r\n          The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the\r\n          back of the game-pods.\r\n          The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are\r\n          lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which\r\n          are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal\r\n          jacks positioned just above the belt line.\r\n          Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the\r\n          dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his\r\n          bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering,\r\n          rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous\r\n          system, on his lap.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          The last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed\r\n          i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game-\r\n          pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the\r\n          players on either side of her.\r\n          We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul,\r\n          standing with arms folded near the church's side door,\r\n          watching the proceedings with fascination.\r\n          A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from\r\n          the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens\r\n          it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church.\r\n          Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his\r\n          way.\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          Hold it.

Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul\r\n          into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl\r\n          case slung over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n<b>                         DICHTER\r\n</b>          Oh, god.

He glances at Levi, who's\r\n          still blissed out and humming, then launches himself\r\n          awkwardly through the crowd.\r\n          Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way\r\n          towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his\r\n          weapon as he goes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                         DICHTER\r\n</b>          Death to eXistenZ!

Don't do it!\r\n          Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small\r\n          crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter\r\n          hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller.\r\n          The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off\r\n          her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second\r\n          bullet on its seat rim.\r\n          The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and\r\n          jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's\r\n          traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her\r\n          folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and\r\n          confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of\r\n          it. Blood seeps in between her fingers\r\n          Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform\r\n          to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the\r\n          players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately\r\n          goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the\r\n          ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their\r\n          shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain\r\n          transmitting through their UmbyCords.\r\n          Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him\r\n          with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his\r\n          weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But\r\n          before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants\r\n          produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty\r\n          their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to\r\n          squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting\r\n          him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost\r\n          amongst the jostling feet.\r\n          The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the\r\n          players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously\r\n          causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying\r\n          Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at\r\n          whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of\r\n          bodies.\r\n          in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the\r\n          stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the\r\n          stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                         LEVI\r\n</b>          Get her out of here!

He falls painfully to his\r\n          knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in\r\n          his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified.\r\n          He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as\r\n          he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their\r\n          way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns\r\n          cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun\r\n          into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly\r\n          looking around for Geller.\r\n          She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a\r\n          few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul\r\n          unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a\r\n          lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one\r\n          arm, screams at them.\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                         (SCREAMS)\r\n</b>          She's coming with me!

As she\r\n          clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her\r\n          through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded\r\n          dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They\r\n          head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they\r\n          might be lethal.\r\n          As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six\r\n          fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the\r\n          body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two\r\n          assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

We see a small purple flower-mark, like\r\n          the kind that marks sides of beef, on the skin over Pikul's\r\n          spine just above the belt line. Pikul stands up from his\r\n          kneeling position on the wingback chair. He stretches,\r\n          twists. Everything seems to be all right.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GAS\r\n</b>          See, that didn't hurt, did it?\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          I didn't expect that to hurt.

It is a scary thing, like a hydraulic jack\r\n          designed by Giger, only smaller.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          Yeah, that's what I expect will\r\n          hurt.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GAS\r\n</b>          I've never crippled anyone yet.\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          How many have you done?\r\n\r\n<b>                         GAS\r\n</b>          Three. Well, you'll be the third.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          We are close on a bizarre insect which sits unsteadily on\r\n          the chrome of a gas pump handle. Geller's hand comes into\r\n          frame and gently eases the creature into its palm. Geller\r\n          floats her hand closer to her face and studies the creature\r\n          with an expression of rapture on her face.\r\n          The insect is large, praying mantis-sized, and it has two\r\n          heads, neither of which seems to know how to deal with the\r\n          other one. Each time it attempts to move, it falls over in\r\n          an awkward heap because its legs are all different sizes and\r\n          shapes. It beats its large, papery wings wildly in order to\r\n          pull itself upright and then begins the whole clumsy process\r\n          all over again. Eventually, its wing action lifts it off\r\n          Geller's hand - more by accident than will, it seems - and\r\n          the creature disappears in the darkness surrounding the gas\r\n          pumps.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          Geller enters the garage and sees Pikul with his back to the\r\n          wall of the service bay and a large wrench in his hand,\r\n          poised and threatening. Gas stands twenty feet away, his\r\n          insertion gun at the ready. A Mexican standoff.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          What's going on, Gas?\r\n\r\n<b>                         GAS\r\n</b>          Hell, he's acting like I'm\r\n          attackin' him.

He watches her lips move from the corner of his eye.\r\n          They. are full and moist and convincing.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          This is it, you see. This is the\r\n          cage I was talking about, the\r\n          cage of your own making which\r\n          keeps you trapped and pacing\r\n          about in the smallest possible\r\n          space forever. Break out of your\r\n          cage, Pikul. Break out now.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT. GAS-STATION GARAGE. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          Wearing mechanic's work gloves, Gas fires in the bioport\r\n          plug. Its impact knocks the breath out of Pikul, like being\r\n          kicked in the spine; he can't even scream. When Gas pulls\r\n          the insertion device away from Pikul's back, we see the\r\n          glossy plastic head of the bioport plug. It's surrounded by\r\n          a small, angry-looking volcano of rashy, irritated flesh.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          That swelling doesn't last for\r\n          long.

He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul\r\n          notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          You're looking more like a\r\n          butcher than a mechanic.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GAS\r\n</b>          Things do get kinda confused\r\n          these days, don't they? I'm gonna\r\n          go wash up. You two make\r\n          yourselves at home.\r\n          Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great\r\n          satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and\r\n          starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it.\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          What are you doing?\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          We don't have to wait for the\r\n          swelling to go down.\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          You're going to port into me?\r\n          While I'm paralysed?\r\n\r\n<b>                         GELLER\r\n</b>          You wanted to play my game,\r\n          didn't you?\r\n\r\n<b>                         PIKUL\r\n</b>          Yeah, I did, and I do, but...\r\n          Here?

Pikul can still feel the warmth of\r\n          Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty,\r\n          narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon\r\n          which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which\r\n          the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and\r\n          ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building.\r\n          The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with\r\n          hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly\r\n          line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID\r\n          card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is\r\n          somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around\r\n          because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside\r\n          down.\r\n\r\n<b>                         NOURISH\r\n</b>          Tryin' to remember who you are?\r\n          Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking\r\n          worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he\r\n          twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work\r\n          shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH.\r\n\r\n<b>                         NOURISH\r\n</b>          Hey, it works!

The insect boards,\r\n          Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and\r\n          frozen together like a sick collage.

POD ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Pikul enters the huge back wing of the Trout Farm and walks\r\n          along a rampway, pushing his cart past the pod assembly-bay\r\n          area. There, pods very much like the one he and Geller are\r\n          ported into back home are being assembled - motherboards\r\n          inserted, internal ports connected, fleshy housings like the\r\n          corpses of small amphibians sewn up - by small teams of\r\n          workers.\r\n          The bays themselves are old horse stalls with straw still\r\n          covering the dirt floors. But because the pods are primarily\r\n          organic, the teams are more like groups of masked surgical\r\n          workers in a series of impossibly small and filthy operating\r\n          rooms than, let's say, auto-assembly teams in a progressive\r\n          Saab plant.\r\n          As Pikul wheels his cart past each stall, he digs into the\r\n          cart's canvas bag and delivers insect boards wrapped in\r\n          brown wax paper to the eagerly awaiting pod teams.\r\n          In the last bay, one of the masked surgeons grabs him by the\r\n          hand instead of taking the proferred motherboard pnd leads\r\n          himm to an isolated corner. Her ID card says she is BARB\r\n          BRECKEN, and her photo says she is Geller.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          GELLER,\r\n</b>          (slipping off her mask)\r\n          I saw you make contact, Larry\r\n          Ashen.

COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          We melt back up into the church, which we last saw in the\r\n          first scene. But there are many differences between then and\r\n          now,\r\n          Geller is sitting in her chair on the dais as before, her\r\n          eyes just beginning to flutter open. But Pikul is sitting\r\n          next to her, also playing the game. And next to him is\r\n          Nourish, whom we are even more surprised to see in this\r\n          context.\r\n          Aad in fact, the players who are sitting in the circle of\r\n          chairs on the dais are all characters who have been in the\r\n          movie up to this point: Nader, the cashier, Dichter, Gas,\r\n          Vinkokur, even Frances, the limo driver.\r\n          The players are all emerging from a game that has just ended\r\n          - the movie we have been watching - and they begin to stir\r\n          in their game gear, which is nothing like the organic pod-\r\n          technology we have just seen.\r\n          On the contrary, the garners are wearing head-gear with\r\n          electrodes, more like normal clunky Virtual-Reality\r\n          equipment, and are linked by mundane wires. In their laps\r\n          they hold, not game-pods, but sleek plastic game modules,\r\n          each about the size of a walkman, with holes into Which\r\n          I their left thumbs are inserted - a simpler and cruder\r\n          version of the bioports we have become used to.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Watching the proceedings from down on the church floor are\r\n          two security guards, neither of whom is Pikul, of course. On\r\n          a leash, one of the security guards holds the dog that, in\r\n          the game, picked up the gristle gun in the Chinese\r\n          restaurant.\r\n          Also monitoring the action are a woman, Merle, who is the\r\n          game's actual project manager - the real-life version of the\r\n          game-character Levi - and her two assistants.\r\n          There is a collective sigh as the game finally releases the\r\n          players, and now they are free to remove their thumbs from\r\n          the game modules and slide their head-gear off.\r\n          The two assistants - the real-life ones are both matronly\r\n          women - begin to help everyone unplug, neatly gathering up\r\n          the equipment in padded bags as they go.\r\n          A broadly smiling Merle mounts the dais and stands in the\r\n          centre of the ring of players.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MERLE\r\n</b>          Are you all back?\r\n          The man whom we knew in the game as Yevgeny Nourish\r\n          immediately stands and takes charge.

Don't hold\r\n          back. After that, we're going to\r\n          form a focus group where we'll\r\n          discuss details of each of your\r\n          experiences playing TranscendenZ.\r\n          You've all had different but\r\n          interlocking lives in the game,\r\n          and I think you'll be amazed when\r\n          you hear each other's stories.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

The\r\n          whole thing felt unstable,\r\n          dangerous, volatile.
