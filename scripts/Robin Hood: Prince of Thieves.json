Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,\nalmond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES\nacross the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.\nHundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of\nminarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to\ntheir devotions.\n\nEXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\nINT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET\nPervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping\nwater. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.\nBedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged\ntogether with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two\ncrusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER\nDUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but\nremnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their\nfaces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk.\n\nINT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET\n\nA furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained\nvictims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two\nwhite men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at\nPeter, jabbering in Arabic.\n                         INTERROGATOR\n           He says you stole his bread.\n                         PETER\n           It is a lie.

A red-hot\nscimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.\nTwitching.\nRobin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his\nknees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers\nunlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,\nforcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter\ncatches his eye... Robin winks.\nThe scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.\nArcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized.\n                       ROBIN\n         And this is English courage.\nHe hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his\nfast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.\nSlash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at\nhim. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.\nDespite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.\nKnife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the\nfurnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the\nfire. Screaming.\n                       PETER\n         That's for five years of hell.\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        3.\nCONTINUED:\nA jailer aims a scalding blade at Robin's back.\n                         VOICE (O.S.)\n         Behind you!\nWarned, Robin ducks away.    Slams the jailer's head into\nthe wall.\nPeter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.\nWhile fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted\nthe warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.\nHeavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even\nhis bald head is ornamented.\n                       ROBIN\n         You speak English?\n                       SARACEN\n         The king's own.

Mine is a\n         sentence of death.\nRobin sidesteps, propelling a guard into a pit.\n                       PETER\n         Don't trust him.\nTwo more guards attack, yelling fury.    Robin eyes the\ncurved scimitar.\n                       ROBIN\n         What I would give for an English\n         sword. This is a pruning hook.\nA guard swings at him with a giant axe.    Robin slashes...\nshears the axe handle in two.\n                        ROBIN\n         Hmm!   Not bad.\nHe runs the man through. Peter loses his sword. His\nopponent moves in for the kill... Peter grabs tongs from\nthe fire and smolders his opponent with a backhand.\nCommotion outside.    RAISED VOICES and RUNNING FEET.\n                       SARACEN\n         Free me and I will show you a way\n         out.\n                                            (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                       4.\nCONTINUED:\n                       ROBIN\n         Why should we trust you?\n                       SARACEN\n         If you don't, you are dead men.\n                       ROBIN\n         He makes a point.\nThe door bursts open.    More guards rush in.\n                         ROBIN\n         A good point.\nHe slashes the man free.\n\n                         PETER\n         Robin!\n                       ROBIN\n         Whatever blood is in his veins, he\n         does not deserve to die here.\n                         SARACEN\n         This way!\nHe beckons them to the back.     A hidden door leads into a\ntunnel.\n\nINT. SEWERS - NIGHT\nThey wade through foul water up to their waists. The\nSaracen leads... A snake lashes out for his face. Robin\nlops off its head.\n\n                       SARACEN\n         You are fast, my friend.\n                       ROBIN\n         Five years I've waited for the\n         smell of free air. That makes a\n         man fast.\nGuards drop down from above, carrying torches.    Blocking\nthe way.\n                       SARACEN\n         You will need to be yet faster.\nA narrow opening to their left... they splash through.\nHalf running, half crawling in the dank water. Fire\narrows land around them. The orange smoke is choking.\n                                             (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                     5.\nCONTINUED:\n                        SARACEN\n         Poison air.   Hold your breath.\nFlames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass\nof crawling slime. Peter falls. A pursuer descends on\nhim, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen\nintercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it\nwith one mighty twist.\n                       PETER\n                (coughing)\n         Thanks. I misjudged you.\n                       SARACEN\n         Save your breath.\n\nGasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-\nward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they\nslide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the\nwalls ahead.\nRobin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.\nThey're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,\nbracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.\nSparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it\nworks.\n                       SARACEN\n         Allah be praised.\n                       ROBIN\n         Amen, brother.\nA bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down\nthe sewer chute. The three men press themselves against\nthe wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the\nspikes.\nA draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using\nthe spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a\ngrating.\n\nEXT. ARAB STREET - NIGHT\nRobin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of\nmounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears.\nAll clear. They're outside the prison wall.

An arrow pierces through Peter's chest -- fired\nfrom the prison wall. He reels... Robin leads him under\nthe wall for protection. Shouts of alarm. Soldiers\napproaching.\n                         ROBIN\n         Come, Peter.    We must hurry.\nRaising his sword, Peter faces the oncoming soldiers.\n                         PETER\n         It is mortal.    Leave me.\n                       ROBIN\n         Hold on to my shoulder.\n\nPeter shakes him off.\n                       PETER\n         My mother... my little sister.\n         Tell them I love them.

We\n         cannot save him.\nRobin knows it's true. Peter pulls an insignia ring from\na hidden pouch in his clothes. Thrusts it into Robin's\nhand.\n                       PETER\n         Take this to my sister. Swear you\n         will protect her for me...

Fighting like a man pos-\nsessed, Peter is swallowed in a sea of enemy soldiers.\n\n                                                         7.\nDESERTED ALLEY - LATER\nRobin and the Saracen catch their breath.\n                          ROBIN\n            Farewell, friend.

LOCKSLEY CASTLE (NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND)\nEerie shapes. Weaving. White light on water. The moon\nreflected in the moat of a small castle. Towers shrouded\nin night mist. Smoke curls from a chimney.\nSUPERIMPOSE:   LOCKSLEY CASTLE, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, ENGLAND\n\nINT. LOCKSLEY CASTLE - NIGHT\nFIRE CRACKLES in an open hearth. Hams and a half sheep\nhang, smoking. An old DOG SNORES at the fireside. A\nbone clunks on the floor, waking him.\n                       VOICE (O.S.)\n         Enough of that din, Remus.    I\n         can't think.\nLicking the bone gratefully, the dog looks in the direc-\ntion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD\nLOCKSLEY.\nSeated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a\nwonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for\nsolace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast\ntable. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a\nportrait over the fireplace... Robin.\nThe dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley\nunsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the\nBible. The door bursts open. A peasant, ragged,\ndesperate, KENNETH.\n                        KENNETH\n         My Lord!   Help me.\nHe's bleeding from a face wound.

They move on...\nAhead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.\nStrange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley\nties his nervous horse to a tree.\nParting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.\nHe's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.\nBeyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,\nall arranged on stakes.

They are to dissuade\n         the faint of heart. Think of\n         Gwen.\nFrom the crest of the rise, they peer down into the\ncraggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers\nat them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a\ncircle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.\nA medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose\nrobes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.\nLord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror.

A creature leaps into the circle\nof stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered\narms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON.
