Just as the\nmusic reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH.\n\nA BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine.

Gaping at it is a goofy,\nbespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back\nand forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right\neye keeps going back and forth with the watch.\n\n                           SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.)\n            Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when\n            it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on,\n            get back, ve haven't got all day.\n\nNow BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized.\n\n<b>INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)\n</b>\nA squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the\nGettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the\nblackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            It was third grade. The teacher was Miss\n            Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she\n            smelled funny - but she was kind.\n\n<b>                           MISS HUDLAPP\n</b><b>            CLASS!\n</b>                 (turning around suddenly)\n            How many times have I told you? In this class we\n            do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head!\n\n\n<b>REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY\n</b>\nHapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his\nfront-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised\naround him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling.\n\nA dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            You know how some teachers have those, kind of,\n            flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp\n            flab that like, dangle?\n\nAs MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty\ngallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR.\n\nMISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust.\nYoung STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN\non the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth,\nwith a loud SLAP each time they collide.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I\n            watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to\n            feel...well...oddly...\n\nNow we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath:\nDonna Summer, \"I FEEL LOVE.\"\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            ...aroused.\n                 (beat)\n            And then the horror began.\n\nDOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls\naround him are pointing and tittering.\n\nGrimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto\nhis lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK\ngoes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back!\n\nThe kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of\ntextbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and\nBOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring\ndirectly at him...\n\n<b>                           MISS HUDLAPP\n</b>            Young man. What's that in your lap?\n\nShe marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on\n            the Washington Monument. And then...all at once\n            ...there he was.\n\nThe BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET\nOUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES!\n\n<b>                           STANLEY (V.O.)\n</b>            Monkeybone!!\n\nThe libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS\nHUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone:\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.\n\nKC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to the\nfront of the class. He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins\ndancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS. Butt left, WHAP. Butt right, WHAP.\n\nThe KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn\nback and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.\n\n\n<b>INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)\n</b>\nA roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync\nwith the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S\nREPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show,\nand they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.\n\nIn the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and\nSTU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional,\nabnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating\nif it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.\n\nSTU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon\non the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously\naround to see how the rest of the audience is responding.\n\nWhy? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.\nIn his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-\ndeprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY.\n\n<b>INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)\n</b>\nAs the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of\nLITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL...\n\n<b>INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED)\n</b>\nA CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his\nmouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY\n</b>            How about it, Doc? Can you help me?\n\n<b>                           SHRINK\n</b>            Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take\n            time. I vould estimate...roughly...\n\nOn the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-\nfoot CABIN CRUISER. \"NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!\" With his free\nhand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR...\n\n<b>                           SHRINK\n</b>            Twelve years and three months ought to do it.\n\nThe SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY\n</b>            One question, doc - what did you mean when you\n            said \"imaginary\"?\n\n<b>                           SHRINK\n</b>            All in good time, my boy. All in good time.\n\nThe SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats.\nThen he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER.\n\n<b>                           SHRINK\n</b>            Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL\n<b>            OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!!\n</b>\nNow he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It\nTWITCHES slightly - of its own free will.\n\n<b>                           VOICE IN BACKPACK\n</b>            Imaginary, huh? You quack.\n\n\n<b>EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED)\n</b>\nA WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES\nHIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the\nway down to the street.\n\nSPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.\nHe kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.\n\n<b>                           STANLEY\n</b>            Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a\n            good shrink.\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you\n            how to stop sucking your thumb...\n\nMONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off\ninto the sunset.\n\n<b>INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\nSTANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.\nHERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:\n\n<b>                           HERB\n</b>            Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,\n            Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an\n            order for six new episodes!\n\nHERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the\nroom who's still in his seat.\n\n<b>                           HERB\n</b>            Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it\n            all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic\n            strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu\n            Miley!\n\nA SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks\ngenuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening.\n\nJULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She\nWINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE\nat the adoring crowd.\n\n<b>INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nSTU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We\n            have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at\n            Nike doing that.\n\nA beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.\n\n<b>                           BEAUTIFUL FAN\n</b>            Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my\n            belly?

STU thinks for a moment, then goes to\nwork. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the\ngirl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD.\n\n<b>                           BEAUTIFUL FAN\n</b>            Wait! You have to draw the rest of him -\n\nShe begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw\nMonkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs...\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO-\n<b>            OCCCC!!\n</b>\nHe wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a\nbunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Hey, Doc.

ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nThere's nothing \"cool\" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal\nfire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out\n            ...they close...you can't get back in!\n\nHe opens one door and holds it for JULIE.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            You want to leave?

For a\nmoment they completely forget about the party in the next room.\n\nThen HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for\nthe clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart:\n\n<b>                           HERB\n</b>            Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute.

You\n            thought him up, and everybody loves him, and\n            he's probably going to make you rich. So relax!\n            Enjoy it!\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            I'm trying. It's weird, that's all.

It just so happens this is the\n            happiest night of my life.\n\nHe says it so solemnly that she cracks up. After a moment he joins in.\n\n<b>EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nA PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry\nto the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:\n\n                  It's His World. We Just Live in It!\n<b>                               MONKEYBONE\n</b>                        Sunday Nights This Fall\n\nTWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR\nidles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy\nLOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...\n\n<b>INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n</b>\nAs STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK approaching\nin the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted\natop the cab. He chuckles...\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            That damn monkey is everywh--\n\nSuddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS. The MONKEYBONE BANNER has\nfallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD, like a huge SHROUD. All he can\nsee is a great, grinning MONKEY FACE!!\n\nJULIE SCREAMS. STU SCREAMS. Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and\n<b>JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT.\n</b>\nOff screen: HORNS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. The horrible crunch of METAL\n<b>ON METAL.\n</b>\nBut Stu's car comes to a halt untouched. After a moment he opens his\neyes...and JULIE opens hers...\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Did we just - hit something?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            I don't think so.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Are you okay??\n\nShe thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then\nopens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the\nopposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside,\nwaits, opens the door again...\n\n<b>EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\nHis eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The\nasphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,\nlunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this\n<b>SWERVED...\n</b>\n...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a\nTELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up\nlike an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for\nthe prom - seem to be okay.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Hey!

On the way there he\nplucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with\nboth hands.\n\nJULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is\nglassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Dad's car?\n\nThe BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.\n\nThen: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,\nlike nails on a blackboard...\n\n<b>                           TEENAGE GIRL\n</b>            What was that? Did you hear that?\n\nThe horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the\nTELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it\nTOPPLES. Directly toward...\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b><b>            STU!!\n</b>\n<b>ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH\n</b>\nHe sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Operator? I want to report an accident.\n\nFinally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming\ndown toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes\nwiden. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...\n\n<b>CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE\n</b>\nA HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which\nSTU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an\ninsane, almost macabre grin.\n\nThe screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a\nDISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...\n\n<b>STU'S POV: ON JULIE\n</b>\nHe's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,\nworking feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love\n            you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -\n\nAll at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if\nSINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the\nfloor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:\n\n<b>                           JULIE (V.O.)\n</b>            I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...\n\nAnd then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down\nthrough some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing\nSHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...\n\nAn AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes\nclose - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:\n\n<b>EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING\n</b>\nA tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of\nan impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a\nvast black VOID...\n\n...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not\nunlike a disembodied FIST.\n\nAnd, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -\nturning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the\ntown, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...\n\n\n<b>EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -\nstops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION\nPLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's\nstranded - alone.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?\n                 (beat)\n<b>            PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.\n</b>\nOff in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: \"PSYCHOLOGICAL\nBAGGAGE CLAIM.\" There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He\nexamines the TAGS. They all belong to him!\n\nHe sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...\n\n - A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;\n\n - An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the\n   Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;\n\n - A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled \"STU M. - GEOGRAPHY,\" its\n   inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;\n\n - Transparent plastic models of \"THE VISIBLE MAN\" and his mate, \"THE\n   VISIBLE WOMAN,\" with a couple of spare organs that young STU never\n   quite found a place for;\n\n - A vinyl LP of \"BREAD'S GREATEST HITS,\" which STU quickly slips back\n   into the suitcase lest anyone see it.\n\nAs he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...\n\n                           RACCOON (o.s.)\n            Carry your bags, mister?\n\nA STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on\nSTU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated\npelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes\nslithering out from beneath the baggage cart...\n\n<b>                           SNAKE\n</b>            Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!\n\nSTU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.\n\n<b>                           RABBIT\n</b>            Wanna meet my sister?\n\nThese bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the\ntire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.\n\n<b>EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT\n</b>\nA long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY\nCARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a\nsputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:\n\n<b>                               D RK TOWN\n</b>\nA FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part.

DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nIt's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the\nfestive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect\nand decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,\nand given up halfway through.\n\nSTU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small\ngroup of OTHER HUMANS...\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Help me. Please. There's animals. They -\n\nThe humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches\none of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.\n\n<b>                           VOICE\n</b>            Pony ride, Mister?\n\nHe turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The\nCOWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!\n\nThe characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE\nOPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could\nbe the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as\nstreet entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.\n\nSTU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:\n\n - JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -\n\n<b>                           JOE CAMEL\n</b>            Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?\n\n - a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.\n   The marquee reads:\n\n<b>                        LIVE! NIGHTMARES!

A THREE-HEADED\n   DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and\n   recognizes STU, much to his horror.\n\n<b>                           HEAD #1\n</b>            Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?\n\n<b>                           HEAD #2\n</b>            We're big fans.\n\n<b>                           HEAD #3\n</b>            Could we have your autograph?\n\nReduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above\nthe door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini\nglass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are\nreplaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.\n\n\n<b>INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nSTU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter\npast outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around.\n\nThe bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in\nwheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV\nbottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a\nMERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny\nMercer's \"DREAM.\" And over at the BAR...\n\n                           BULL (o.s.)\n            New in town, huh? What're you drinking?\n\nOut of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns\naway to grab a fresh glass.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Chasing me - animals - horrible -\n\n<b>                           BULL\n</b>            Animals? What kind of animals?\n\nSTU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a\nBULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side.\n\n<b>                           BULL\n</b>            Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's\n            what everybody says - although personally, I\n            don't see the resemblance. What are you\n            drinking?\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Uhh - martini?\n\n<b>                           BULL\n</b>            Olive or eyeball?\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Olive. - Where exactly am I?\n\n<b>                           BULL\n</b>            Dark Town.

You're\n            quite a celebrity down here.\n\nSTU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the\nbar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot\nthrough a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES.\n\n<b>                           BULL\n</b>            I told you, it's the land of nightmares.

BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT\n</b>\nA limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. On\nthe vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP, four poses for a dollar. In the\nfirst three, STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces. In the\nfourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic.\n\nShe gazes at it for a long, long time. Eventually she smiles.\n\n<b>INT. SECOND BEDROOM/STUDIO - NIGHT\n</b>\nOPEN on two PHOTOS, mounted in a single frame. On the left, BUSTER\nKEATON, droopy-eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. On the right,\na Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND, in the same pose, also\nwearing Keaton's hat and vest.\n\nThese photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STU's\nstudio and JULIE's office. MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the\ndrafting table. ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed.\n\nAs she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC\nCANVAS in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full\nof spiral-bound sketchbooks. She pulls it out. She's obviously disturbed\nby it, but she can't tear her eyes away...\n\nShe's still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth\nrobe.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            Who did this?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Stu.

They're\nstanding over a HUMAN PATIENT, replacing his internal organs with\nMACHINE PARTS. The style is at once cartoony and unsettling.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing\n            him, but I never realized what you cured him\n            from.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years.\n            The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start\n            right in painting...\n                 (chuckling)\n\n            That boy looked like pluperfect hell.\n\nALICE's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE strips\ntacked up over the drafting table.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            How do you get from here - to there?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Switch hands.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            What?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction -\n            right brain and left brain out of balance. He\n            was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil\n            to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.\n\nA smile comes to JULIE's face. She settles in on the floor beside ALICE\nand digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a\nquickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for...\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            Monkeybone?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Left-handed, he was funny.

She isn't telling.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I\n            am not going to let him get away from me.\n\n<b>INT.

STU is giving chase when -\nsuddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.\n\nEVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place.\n\nFor there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most\ndreaded figure in all of Dark Town -\n\n- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some\nhapless coma victim to the land of Death!\n\nEERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the\nREAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU\nbacks away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and\nMONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.\n\nBut the REAPER moves on - past each COMA VICTIM in turn - finally\nSTOPPING in front of a TINY, WIZENED, PRUNELIKE OLD GENT in a\nwheelchair, who looks to be 110 years old at least.\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Him.

COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway.\n\nIt's a \"TEST YOUR STRENGTH\" machine - the kind where you slam down a\nmallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and\nstorm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE\n<b>- NO ADMITTANCE.\n</b>\nEARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the\nentrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and\nCARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky...\n\nAll around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of\nswirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a\nPINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center.\n\nThe \"TEST YOUR STRENGTH\" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where\nthe bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL\nMAN lifts its enormous mallet...\n\n...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL\nROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky.

They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the\nCow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a\nbaseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER.\n\nThe ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!\n\n<b>                           STU/MONKEYBONE\n</b>                 (in unison - impressed)\n            Damn.\n\nMONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.\nBut STU isn't intimidated.

STU starts chasing after him!\n\nThe REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of\nthe \"fingers\" of the hand that holds Dark Town.

HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\nELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age\nbachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us,\ntiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft.\n\nHYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a\nparty in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on\nwalls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS.\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Now this...is livin'.\n\nOf course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the\nscene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ\nSLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once.\n\nAs STU wanders through, he gets a big surprise. Reproductions of his old\nNIGHTMARE PAINTINGS are hanging on the walls! They've been turned into\nONE-SHEETS for the coming attractions at the Morpheum.\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Y'call that art?

We\nfollow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into\na statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES.\n\n<b>                           MONKEYBONE\n</b>            Hey!

As they head for a back room, the\nBARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT.\n\nA look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONE's face. But before he can\nchange his mind, the GORGON'S HAND yanks him out of frame.\n\nSTU, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering\nanimal-people who DANCE in their bizarre, uninhibited way. A FIVE-LEGGED\nWOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU as\nhe passes. He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five\nconstantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos?\n\n<b>                           HAND WOMAN\n</b>            Hyp?

Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. Now\nshe's armless - a regular Venus de Milo!\n\n<b>                           HAND WOMAN\n</b>            You fat slob!

A number of sofas and lounge chairs\nare arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room.\n\nThe ORB is where nightmares happen. Although the perspective shifts and\nthe locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a\n3-D quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us!\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Wow.

But when she\ntries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS.\n\nSuddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together\nthrough the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy.\n\n<b>INT.

He's a chubby-cheeked, bespectacled\nACCOUNTANT TYPE...a harried bureaucrat, just trying to do his job.\nThere's something sweet, almost avuncular about him.\n\nThere's an open crate of DEAD SOULS on his desk. Dead souls take the\nform of PERFORATED PAPER DOLLS...two-dimensional, underwear-clad,\nusually wearing expressions of shock. DEATH pulls a sheet from the box,\ndetaches the dead soul, and outfits it with a cut-out TOGA.\n\nNow he places it in a big diorama - with OODLES of toga-clad souls\nstaring up at a scale model of an active volcano.

The\nASSISTANT dials in a combination, turns the wheel, laboriously pulls the\ndoor open and STEPS INSIDE...\n\n...returning, a moment later, with a priceless gold E-TICKET!!\n\nThe UPPER HALF of the STAINED REAPER begins to gyrate wildly.\n\n<b>CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER THE SHROUD\n</b>\nMONKEYBONE is doing an agitated TAP DANCE on his head.

The boys follow. The little\nHELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk...\n\n...and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth! The boys keep on\nwalking, but the shroud stays behind. Somehow they go three or four\nsteps before they realize they've been exposed.\n\nDEATH jumps a foot in the air and SHRIEKS.

Panic time!\n\nNearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they\nrace toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,\nYANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.\n\nSTU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with\nit. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -\n\n- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: \"CYCLE REPAIR.\"\n\n<b>EXT.

MONKEYBONE waves brightly. Then a mob of REAPERS\nappears on either side of LULU's car, swarming out onto the tracks! STU\nstarts pedaling for his life.\n\nHe makes for the TRAIN TUNNELS in the far wall of the station.\nILLUMINATED SIGNS over the tunnels read: Calcutta...Hong Kong...Waco, TX\n...and directly ahead...\n\nDark Town!! By now they're well out onto the turnaround. STU pedals\nfrantically, BOUNCING over tracks and ties.

The drawbridge lowers...\n\nAs STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and\nTRIPS HIM!

The cake bears the message \"WELCOME HOME -\nI LOVE YOU\" in pink icing.\n\nShe sits beside him with the goodies. He removes his foot from the bowl,\ncrosses his legs, WIGGLES HIS TOES at her.

Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE\nwaltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single\nrobe.\n\nThe only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck\nbehind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his\nmistress about the imposter in STU's body.

He circles back\nand forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting,\nFEINTING at her occasionally.\n\nJULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but\nin fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up\non the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way.\n\nNow he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal\nhowl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE!\n\nTerrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the\nheadboard.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Oh, God!! Baby! Are you -\n\nDazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and\nhe pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand.\n\n<b>EXT.

The startled\nSURGEON drops the kidney back into place.\n\n<b>                           ORGAN DONOR\n</b>            What the - who the hell am I??\n\n<b>                           SURGEON\n</b>            You're an organ donor!\n\n<b>                           ORGAN DONOR\n</b>            Am I dead?!?\n\n<b>                           SURGEON\n</b>            The chute didn't open. We kind of assumed -\n\n<b>                           ORGAN DONOR\n</b>            I need this body. Just for a few minutes. I'll\n            bring it back, okay?\n\nThe ORGAN DONOR grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out. (And\nsince STU is temporarily occupying the DONOR's body, we will henceforth\nrefer to him as O.D. STU.)\n\n\n<b>INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\n</b>\nO.D. STU comes racing around a corridor. His LAB COAT is already covered\nwith gore, and he's having trouble holding his GUTS in. His PANCREAS\nspills out onto the floor just as two DOCTORS stroll past.\n\n<b>                           DOCTOR\n</b>                 (eyeing the pancreas)\n            Might have someone take a look at that.\n\n<b>                        O.D. STU\n</b>            Oh. Yeah. Thanks.\n\nThe DOCTORS move on. O.D. STU spots a JANITOR'S CART with a roll of DUCT\nTAPE on one shelf. He WRAPS IT TIGHTLY around his midsection to keep his\ninnards from falling out. Then he runs for it.\n\nNow the TEAM OF SURGEONS rounds the corner in hot pursuit. The lead\nSURGEON spots O.D. STU at the end of the corridor and takes off after\nhim. But he SLIPS on the PANCREAS and goes sprawling!\n\nThe pancreas goes flying down the hall, where it gets SQUASHED in rapid\nsuccession by a GURNEY and by a little old lady's MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR.\nWhen the SURGEONS retrieve it, it's a hunk of pulp.\n\n<b>                           LEAD SURGEON\n</b>            I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice.\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - DAY\n</b>\nGUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and\nhabitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON.\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY\n</b>\nThe BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a\ntree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He\nsputters and coughs...\n\nThen he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them\nchase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in\nher formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification.\n\n<b>EXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY\n</b>\nO.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in.\n\n<b>INT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY\n</b>\nO.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room.\n\n                           O.D. STU (o.s.)\n<b>            DOC? DOC?? - JULIE?\n</b>\nNo reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a\nNEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big\nDISPLAY AD for the benefit: \"MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM\nTONIGHT!\" He checks the wall clock: time is short.\n\nReaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE\nBOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens\nthe velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING.\n\nHe hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his\nhead - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a\ndifferent body, BUSTER recognizes him.\n\n<b>EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nO.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit -\nbarking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along!\n\nA BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws\neverything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU.\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY\n</b>\nAs HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his\nface. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off\n...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement...\n\n<b>POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION\n</b>\nThe nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at\nonce he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!!\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY\n</b>\nJULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the\nfood court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it.\n\n<b>                           CLARISSA\n</b>            That's not true, Julie. It's not true.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could\n            be innocent people in danger.\n\n<b>                           CLARISSA\n</b>            He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu.\n                 (beat)\n            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other\n            day he pinched me on the butt.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other\n            day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you\n            have to tell the police.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete.\n            All I have is a feeling.\n\nAll of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the\nreptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED\nMAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.\n\n<b>                           CLARISSA\n</b>            Oh my God, we've got a flasher.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            That...that's Herb!\n\nThe GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and\nCLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC:\n\n<b>                           HERB\n</b>            CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working\n            together. All of them. Shirts...pants...\n<b>            ENSEMBLES...!\n</b>\nThe three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.\n\n<b>INT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nPASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE\nto alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we\nsee O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side.\n\nHe looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with\nblood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's\nstarting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him.\n\n<b>EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\nBUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will\ncarry him, in pursuit of the BUS.\n\n<b>INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nThe team of SURGEONS has been tracking O.D. STU across the city! Through\nthe windshield they see the BUS pulling up outside the zoo. O.D. STU\nhops out and sprints across the parking lot.\n\n<b>                           SURGEON\n</b><b>            IT'S HIM! HE'S GETTING OFF!\n</b>\n<b>INT. ZOO - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nO.D. STU doesn't even stop at the ticket window. He VAULTS over the\nturnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. The SURGEONS aren't far\nbehind. They race up to the ticket window -\n\n<b>                           SURGEON\n</b>            Did you see a corpse running this way?\n\nThe TICKET-TAKER shrugs and points off in O.D. STU's direction.\n\n<b>INT. BANQUET TENT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nThe last stages of dinner. WAITERS are already clearing plates, and\nalthough JULIE has barely touched her food she sends her plate away.\n\nOnstage a BAND is playing tasteful zoo jazz. When the number ends, STU-\nBONE approaches the dais and leans into the mike.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            As emcee I want to thank you all for joining us\n            at this swingin' bash...it's a special night for\n            the birds, and the lions, and the monkeys, but\n            it's also a special night for -\n                 (tapping his chest)\n            - this monkey. And it's special because of a\n            very special lady. Her name is -\n                 (checking a note in his pocket)\n            Julie McElroy. Just kiddin', Julie. Stand up.\n\nJULIE stands reluctantly. The CROWD APPLAUDS.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            And to make this special night extra-special,\n            I'd like to do a special number...especially for\n            you.\n\nA DISCO BALL lowers. STU-BONE turns to welcome a group of BACKUP SOUL\nSINGERS who are just joining the band on stage.\n\nThe TENT begins to ROCK with a throbbing beat. And STU-BONE launches\ninto a wild-eyed, hip-shaking parody of Mick Jagger singing the Rolling\nStones' \"MONKEY MAN\"!\n\nAs he sings, STU-BONE gyrates over toward JULIE, bumping and grinding\nlike the cartoon-monkey sex machine he is. He waves his mike to the\ncrowd, urging everyone to join in. JULIE gasps in disbelief, but the\ncrowd is eating it up - clapping and singing along with STU-BONE.\n\nHe gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor. He opens his\nshirt at the neck, exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair.\n\nHe pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd. He\nwipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd. He\nblows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd.\n\nThen he JUMPS UP ON THE TABLES and shakes his booty wildly,\u00ad strutting in\nand out among the dessert plates. If the real Jagger could see him, he\nwould creep home a sad and broken man.\n\nFor the big finale, he jumps off the table and SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR\nto JULIE'S table - arriving ON HIS KNEES.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            I am just a Monkey Man! I'm glad you are a\n            monkey...woman...too.\n                 (soft voice)\n\n            How about it, Julie?\n\nHe pulls out a RING BOX and hands it to the beet-red JULIE. The crowd\nlets out a collective GASP - followed by WILD APPLAUSE.\n\nShe stares down at the ring - a big vulgar sparkler. She can't speak.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony.\n            An Abba Dabba honeymoon!\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            It looks so...new.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's\n            ring...\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?\n\nNo reply. She's taking a long time to say yes. The audience is\nmuttering.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            Ju-leeee... Operators are standing by... Offer\n            expires at midnight, December 31...\n\nSuddenly a GORE-STAINED FIGURE bursts into the tent.\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b><b>            DOC! DOC! DON'T DO IT! HE ISN'T STU! HE'S\n</b><b>            MONKEYBONE!!!\n</b>\nJULIE's jaw drops. She barely gets a glimpse of O.D. STU before the ZOO\nGUARDS arrive to haul him away.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep\n            call you - ?\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            He called me \"Doc.\"\n\n- which STU-BONE never does. Someone in the crowd yells...\n\n<b>                           GUEST\n</b><b>            HEY MONKEYBONE!!\n</b>\nSTU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd.\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party!\n\nBy the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished!\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nShe races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Please. Where did you take that man...?\n\nThe GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering\nout through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet...\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Who are you? Why did you say those things?\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b>            Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land\n            of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he\n            got my body, see? All they had left for me was\n            this corpse!\n\nJULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b>            Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give\n            people nightmares!\n                 (no response)\n\n            Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They\n            were pulling the plug - I called out to you -\n            and you heard me. Remember?\n\nThis stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single\ntear rolling down her cheek. And then...\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b><b>            BUSTER?!?\n</b>\nThe dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van,\nbarking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns -\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            Stu...how?\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b>            I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you\n            this.\n\nTHROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's\nantique ring.\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b>            I meant to give it to you before. The night we\n            crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to\n            remember me like that, okay? Not like this.\n\nShe slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS\nWELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            What's wrong?\n\n<b>                           O.D. STU\n</b>            I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm\n            all dried up.\n\nJULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just\narrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over.\n\n<b>                           ALICE\n</b>            Detective, please let this man out of the van.\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PI\u00d1ATA AREA - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\nThe PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PI\u00d1ATA,\nwhich is hanging from a tree.

Choke up!\n\nSuddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in\ntow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -\n\n- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as\nthe COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS...\n\n<b>                           ORGANIZER\n</b>            I don't understand, officer.

STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON\n<b>THE END OF THE ROPE!\n</b>\n<b>                           HEAD SURGEON\n</b><b>            LOOK! IT'S HIM!\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING\n</b>\nThey rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's\nadditional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the\nground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the\nballoon!\n\n<b>                           STU-BONE\n</b>            Let...go...you...dingleberry...\n\nAs he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the\nballoon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR.\n\nFor about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a\nheap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a\nWROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws\nsnap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook.\n\nAs the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length\nof the rope.\n\nHe gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to\npush him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE...\n\n...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's\nmidsection! He tries to pull himself together...\n\n<b>EXT. FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nA SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL.\nSomething PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he\nknows, the SERVER is DRENCHED!\n\nThe SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the\npunchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY!\n\n<b>                           HEAD SURGEON\n</b>            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved!\n\nOne of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes.\n\n<b>EXT. TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nBOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR\nWIRE atop a tall storm fence.\n\nThey clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate.\nThey're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are\nLEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them!\n\nAs O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out...\n\n<b>EXT. GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nIt lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he\ncan reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL\nTIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but\na TIGER gets the other end -\n\n- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending\nthe terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The\nHEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver...\n\n<b>                           HEAD SURGEON\n</b>            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON BALLOON\n</b>\nSTU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision\n...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both\nends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP...\n\n<b>EXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nThe SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean\npunch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful\nwhen STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the\ntable, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base...\n\n...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in\npunch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END...\n\n...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the\nSURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE\nCHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES\nDOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...\n\n... at a pair of COPS who are over by the pi\u00f1ata, loading CONFISCATED\nMONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off\ntheir feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!\n\nThe COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE\nunderneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing\nGRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs.\n\nThe HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got\nBEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.\n\n<b>                           HEAD SURGEON\n</b>            Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved!\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nCOPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full\nof confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes\nass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT...\n\n<b>INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\nHYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They\nsee a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and\nspearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS.\n\n<b>                           HYPNOS\n</b>            Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!!\n\n<b>AERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING\n</b>\nSTU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins\nFEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's\nlong enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO!\n\n<b>EXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nWATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them\naround the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds!\n\n<b>ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE\n</b>\nThe balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward,\ntoward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically!\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nA COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon.\n\n<b>                           COP\n</b>            I think I can bring 'em down.\n\n<b>ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nBLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass.\nWith a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE\nsnaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air!\n\n\n<b>ON STU-BONE &amp; O.D. STU - AERIAL\n</b>\nAT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of\nthe gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN...\n\n<b>THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE\n</b>\n...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a\nhundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up\nfast!\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - ON JULIE &amp; CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nJULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.\n\n\n<b>ON STU-BONE &amp; O.D. STU - FALLING\n</b>\n...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the\nparking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.\n\nTheir BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...\n\n<b>AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT\n</b>\n...and the fight continues - even into the afterlife! As they plummet\ndown through the heavens, they REVERT to their true personae. It's STU\nvs. MONKEYBONE, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out - like a\ncouple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!\n\n<b>EXT. STREETS - DARK TOWN - RIGHT\n</b>\nDARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead.\nThey're placing bets, rooting their favorites on. Then...\n\nTHE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all\ndirections, DIVING for the nearest hiding place. They seem to know what\nthis mighty rumbing signifies.\n\nThe E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air -\nand a COLOSSUS appears beneath it! A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in JAPANESE\nCEREMONIAL ARMOR, he TOWERS over Dark Town, so mighty and enormous that\nhe can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat!!\n\n<b>ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING\n</b>\nSTU lands a HAYMAKER, and the two of them break loose of each other -\n\n\n<b>ON ARMORED COLOSSUS - THAT MOMENT\n</b>\n- LANDING in the upturned palms of the COLOSSUS! STU watches in\ndisbelief as a PANEL pops open in the giant's CHEST, revealing...\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b><b>            DEATH!!\n</b>\n<b>                           DEATH\n</b>            I dress up when I want to make an impression. -\n            So how'd it go?\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Fine, thanks.

The roots of this tragedy go back\n            to a callous, uncaring society that -\n\nDEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together.\nMan and monkey are surely squished. But when DEATH opens his hands, STU\nis still there, cupped safely in his palms.\n\n<b>                           STU\n</b>            Hey.

Thank you!\n\n<b>                           DEATH\n</b>            Thank me next time you see me.\n\nHe sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD INTO THE STRATOSPHERE with a single flick\nof his finger. Then he turns...\n\n<b>                           DEATH\n</b>            Ohhhh, Hypnos??\n\nA BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the\nmiddle of the town square.\n\n<b>                           HYPNOS\n</b>            Death! So nice to see you. I can explain -\n\nHe looks up tremulously. A GIANT SHADOW falls across him...followed by a\n<b>GIANT ARMORED FOOT.\n</b>\n<b>EXT. ZOO - DUSK\n</b>\nJULIE SOBS in a POLICEMAN's arms at the exit to the zoo.\n\n<b>                           JULIE\n</b>            I don't know what happened. All I know is...he\n            was in a coma...and then he came back...and now\n            he's gone again.\n\nThey wander out. Behind them, a squad of COPS are confiscating\nMONKEYBONE DOLLS from squawling children as they file out.\n\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DUSK\n</b>\nThe TWO CORPSES, on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the\npolice ambulance. The SURGEON and his team come wandering up.\n\n<b>                           SURGEON\n</b>            Excuse me.

The SURGEON and his TEAM run\naway from the ambulance SHRIEKING.\n\n<b>EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK\n</b>\nBUSTER barks like a maniac.
