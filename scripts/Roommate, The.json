COLLEGE DORM ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sunlight pours through the window of an empty, silent dorm\r\n          room. The room seems alive, somehow. As if it's waiting\r\n          patiently for this year's kids.\r\n          A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,\r\n          right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          OVER CREDITS, we PAN DOWN a hallway full of COLLEGE KIDS.\r\n          They carry boxes, stereo speakers, stand around chatting.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY\r\n\r\n          SARA MATTHEWS, 18, gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm.\r\n          She's pretty, with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just\r\n          above her shoulders. She's dressed casually, but still chic.\r\n          No parents.\r\n          She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the\r\n          other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring\r\n          through the building's window at...\r\n          Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their\r\n          parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks to the registration table. A RESIDENT ASSISTANT\r\n          smiles up at her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hi. Sara Matthews.\r\n          She looks her up in the computer. She plays with a simple\r\n          silver chain around her neck.\r\n\r\n          R.A.\r\n          Des Moines, Iowa. Wow. Flyover\r\n          country.\r\n          She says it nicely, but it still stings. Sara smiles gamely.\r\n\r\n          R.A.\r\n          You're in room three-sixteen.\r\n          Welcome.\r\n          She hands Sara a room key.

DORM HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN ON Sara as she...\r\n          Pushes an ancient, flat-bed cart out of the elevator and down\r\n          the hall, struggling to control its wobbly wheels. She bumps\r\n          into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.\r\n          Sara stops in front of Room 316.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM DOORWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          She opens the door and looks in on:\r\n          A run-of-the-mill freshman dorm room. Tiny; bathroom down the\r\n          hall; twin beds. Heaven.\r\n          Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice\r\n          here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.\r\n          She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.\r\n          First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her\r\n          duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a\r\n          YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.\r\n          Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.\r\n          It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Told you we'd make it.\r\n          She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off\r\n          the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles\r\n          off the other cart.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          Sorry! Bad driver.\r\n          Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --\r\n          clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And\r\n          peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl\r\n          smiles sheepishly.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          In case of emergency.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I'm Tracy.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Sara.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          3.\r\n          Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          A gorgeous fall day. Sara strolls across the quad, taking it\r\n          all in. Kids tossing frisbees... hacky-sacking... sunning on\r\n          the grass. Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm\r\n          windows.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She answers it.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey. Yeah, it's amazing here. I met\r\n          this really cool biker? He's taking\r\n          me to Mexico this weekend.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Hi, Mom. Just tell him I'm kidding.\r\n          Sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop. She eyes a\r\n          work/study ad on the wall.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Everything's great.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          No, she's not here yet so I got to\r\n          choose my side of the room.\r\n          She tears a tab off the flyer.\r\n\r\n          EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Establishing shot of Carnegie, a solid red-brick dorm.\r\n\r\n          INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara's half-settled in now. The wall beside her bed is\r\n          peppered with fashion pages ripped out of Vogue and In Style.\r\n          She sits in a lounge chair, paging through a Vanity Fair\r\n          photo shoot. She spots a cool outfit and tears out the page.\r\n          A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Sara walks over. She opens it\r\n          expectantly to see...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          4.\r\n          Tracy, Tracy's roommate KIM, and two other HALLMATES. All\r\n          dressed to party.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Psi U.'s throwing a bash. Let's go.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Psi U.?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          They're a frat. Beer... guys...\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I don't know... I might just hang\r\n          and wait for my roommate.\r\n          Groans all around. \"Come on\"... \"Lame-O\"... Sara bites her\r\n          lip, considering. She smiles.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Alright. Just let me change.\r\n          The girls cheer.\r\n\r\n          EXT. PSI U. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           Establishing shot of a proud frat house. Students piled on a\r\n           giant porch and there's a long line going up the steps to the\r\n          front door. Music blasts out of the windows.\r\n\r\n          INT. PSI U. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara, Tracy, Kim and the others from the floor are at the\r\n          head of the line, stepping into the house. They're met by a\r\n\r\n          FRAT BOUNCER.\r\n\r\n                         BOUNCER\r\n          (motions to a crowded keg)\r\n          If you want beer, I'll need ID's.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          For a frat party?! Seriously?\r\n          He holds up a handful of ugly lime-green wristbands. Kim\r\n          steps around him.\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          I don't drink anyway.\r\n          Tracy looks at her, mouth agape.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         BOUNCER\r\n          There's punch and non-alcoholic\r\n          beer over there...\r\n          He points to a table with a giant bowl and cups. No one is\r\n          around it.\r\n          Tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Come on, just us. We won't tell.\r\n          The bouncer is tempted but not budging.\r\n\r\n                         BOUNCER\r\n          Honestly, I'm just a pledge.\r\n          They'll kick me out.\r\n          She stomps by him.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Wuss.\r\n          Defeated, Tracy walks over to the table. Turns back to Sara.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          You want something to drink?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What's the point?\r\n          Tracy huffs as Sara walks into A SEA OF KIDS. We're talking\r\n          extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.\r\n          Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,\r\n          but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large\r\n          room.\r\n          A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,\r\n          but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and\r\n          watches them. In particular --\r\n          THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's\r\n          mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara\r\n          chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He\r\n          definitely stands out.\r\n          Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in\r\n          with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.\r\n          Juice spilling over the brim of her cup. Sara stays by the\r\n          wall, afraid of getting any spilled on her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          6.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          (yells over the music)\r\n          Why aren't you dancing?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          To this?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          They're not that bad.\r\n          Tracy pulls Sara deeper in the crowd. Now all three start\r\n          jumping up and down to the music. Sara's getting into it as\r\n          Tracy chugs her drink.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR - LATER\r\n\r\n          A DJ rules the room now. Sara and Kim are dancing with\r\n          others from the floor. Sara notices a speck of punch on her\r\n          shirt. She stops dancing. Wets her fingers and tries to rub\r\n          it out.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Crap.\r\n          Kim still dances as Sara starts to look around.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Where's Tracy?\r\n\r\n                         KIM\r\n          She was getting more punch.\r\n          Sara then spots Tracy, with a full cup, precariously climbing\r\n          onto the stage next to the DJ's table with a bunch of other\r\n          girls already dancing. She starts dancing suggestively,\r\n          egging on the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Uh oh.\r\n          Guys yell out. \"Show em.\" Several hands armed with camera\r\n          phones stretch out above the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (SHOUTS)\r\n          Tracy.\r\n          Tracy can't hear her. Sara starts making her way to the\r\n          stage. Tracy is dancing, getting into it. She grabs the\r\n          bottom of her shirt. Teases the crowd.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (LOUDER)\r\n          Tracy. Don't.\r\n          Sara slams into STEPHEN, 21, the DRUMMER from the band... who\r\n          inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt. Sara\r\n          gasps.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Damn!\r\n          Sara's drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd.\r\n          Camera phones clicking all at once. Sara looks up.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Oh. Woops.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (ANNOYED)\r\n          I have to go clean this up.\r\n          She turns.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Looks like my plan backfired.\r\n          Sara turns back towards him.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What plan?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          To spill beer on you so I can start\r\n          a conversation.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You spilled beer on me purposely?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n\r\n                         (NODS)\r\n          You pissed?\r\n          She looks at him.

Loud and packed to the gills with\r\n          mostly young students. Sara and Tracy stand at the bar,\r\n          getting jostled, looking like... two naive college kids.\r\n          As they try to get the bartender's attention, older guys\r\n          check them out, smiling and mouthing \"Hi.\" Sara tries to\r\n          ignore them, but Tracy's in heaven.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          How great is this? No parents.

Talk\r\n          about the life of the party.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Don't be mean.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          I'm just saying.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          She's just a little hard to get to\r\n          know.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Yeah right...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          26.\r\n          As Tracy rolls her eyes...\r\n          The BARTENDER sets two drinks down in front of them. He nods\r\n          down the bar at...\r\n          TWO MIDDLE-AGED SUITS. Tracy flashes them a smile. Sara's not\r\n          so sure about this.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What do you think?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          I think...\r\n          Tracy raises her shot glass. She and Sara clink and drink.\r\n          Tracy waves at the suits again. Thanks guys.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          We can do better.\r\n          She takes Sara's hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor.\r\n\r\n          INT. CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - LATER\r\n\r\n          Sara and Tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies. Having the\r\n          time of their lives. A HANDSOME GUY moves in, his eyes on\r\n          Tracy.\r\n          Tracy loves it. They dance together as Sara watches, smiling.\r\n          Tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from Sara.\r\n          Sara is now dancing by herself. A GUY moves in on her, but\r\n          she politely dances away. She scans the dance floor for\r\n          Tracy. Where'd she go?\r\n          She steps off the dance floor and scans the bar -- no sign of\r\n          her.\r\n\r\n          INT. CLUB - BATHROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara walks into the crowded ladies' room.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Tracy?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          27.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CLUB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A bummed Sara walks out of the club alone. She rubs her arms\r\n          against the chill. She nervously tugs on her silver chain as\r\n          she scans the STRAGGLERS loitering outside.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (LOUD)\r\n          Tracy.\r\n          She takes one last peek into the club doorway, hoping against\r\n          hope that Tracy will magically appear. No luck.\r\n          She starts walking down the street, away from the club.\r\n          Weary and unnerved.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca lies in bed, wide awake in the dark. Her cell phone\r\n          rings. She stares at it. Two more rings. She picks it up.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Hello?\r\n\r\n          OPERATOR (O.S.)\r\n          Would you accept a collect call\r\n          from...

GAS STATION - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          An old school gas station on a barren corner of the city. No\r\n          cars in either direction. A lone white 328i BMW with a black\r\n          soft top sits next to an ancient pump.\r\n          Rebecca, half asleep, climbs out and grabs the nozzle,\r\n          sticking it in the fuel tank. Starts pumping.\r\n\r\n          MAN (0.S.)\r\n          Can I help you out?\r\n          She turns to see a 20-year-old, good-looking gas station\r\n          attendant. His name tag: \"Rick\".\r\n          Rebecca sizes him up.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          28.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm fine. Just in a hurry.\r\n          She keeps pumping. Speeding it up. Rick ambles up to her,\r\n          treading beyond appropriate personal space. He points to the\r\n          \"Full Service\" sign.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          Just doing my job.\r\n          She stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the\r\n          gas pump and squeezes. She looks down at his hand on top of\r\n          hers. Then lets go of the pump, nudging his hand away.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          All done.\r\n          She pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it\r\n          back at the pump. He stops her. Motions to her face.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          You have a little something.\r\n          No, she doesn't.\r\n          He, ever so gently, rubs his index finger and thumb on her\r\n          cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back.\r\n\r\n                         RICK (CONT'D)\r\n          The hell?\r\n          His crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Sorry.\r\n          But she does it again, holding the lever down, dousing him\r\n          head to toe. He scrambles backward out of range.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA (CONT'D)\r\n          Sorry again. Rick.\r\n          The nozzle's still in her hand, pouring gas in every\r\n          direction. She opens her car door, grabbing a lighter.\r\n          Rick's pissed. Charges towards her.\r\n\r\n                         RICK\r\n          You spoiled c---\r\n          He spots the lighter in her hand. Dead stop. She\r\n          absentmindedly flicks it. It sparks but doesn't light.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          29.\r\n          The gas is now pouring towards him. The meter on the pump is\r\n          still ticking up.\r\n          He scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him\r\n          and drops the still pouring nozzle.\r\n          A hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls\r\n          out a loose hundred dollar bill. Places it on top of the\r\n          pump.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Pussy.\r\n          She gets into her car and drives off. Leaving Rick soaked in\r\n          gasoline.\r\n\r\n          INT./EXT. DINER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara sits by herself in a booth by the window. Hugging a cup\r\n          of hot, sobering coffee.\r\n          Rebecca's car pulls up into a parking spot. The headlights\r\n          shine right in Sara's eyes... and now turn off.\r\n          Sara's tired eyes light up as she sees Rebecca get out of the\r\n          car. She waves. Rebecca doesn't wave back as she heads for\r\n          the door.\r\n\r\n          INT.

A\r\n          little wilder than the old stuff.\r\n          She's a savvy tour guide, confident, at ease. She doesn't\r\n          just walk past pieces -- she studies them. Sara's impressed.\r\n          Sara's cell phone buzzes. She checks the display: \"Jason\".\r\n          She tilts it so that Rebecca can see and rolls her eyes. She\r\n          buries her cell phone in her purse.\r\n          Sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Okay, I have no idea what this is\r\n          supposed to be.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          Even I don't get that one.

Blood is smeared on her\r\n          smock.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          This is my favorite.\r\n          Sara steps closer to examine it.

She really wants\r\n          Sara to like this painting.\r\n          Sara moves even closer. She squints, trying to see what\r\n          Rebecca sees. The woman's expression in the painting is\r\n          actually pretty sinister.\r\n          Sara's a little freaked out... but she turns to see Rebecca's\r\n          hopeful expression.

She picks it up and places it\r\n          around her neck. She fingers it carefully and looks at\r\n          herself in the mirror. She smiles.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

On one condition...\r\n          Sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on\r\n          Rebecca. They both look at Rebecca in the mirror. Wow.\r\n          Rebecca smiles.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I love it, who's the designer?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What are you, a label whore?! Who\r\n          cares ...I got it at a flea market\r\n          and it looks great with the dress.\r\n          Rebecca nods in agreement.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          It just needs one last touch...\r\n          She grabs a pair of small, gold hoop earrings from her\r\n          dresser. She places them in Rebecca's hand.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I'm gonna jump in the shower, then\r\n          we'll head out.\r\n          She grabs her stuff and hurries out the door.\r\n          Rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm. She turns towards the\r\n          full-length mirror behind the door. As she leans into the\r\n          mirror, we see that her ears aren't pierced.\r\n          She takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the\r\n          skin of her right lobe. After a moment of hesitation...\r\n          SHE PUSHES THE PIN IN HARD. A small pop. She flinches. Blood\r\n          trickles down her ear onto her neck. She wipes it off with\r\n          her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear.\r\n\r\n          INT. ART GALLERY - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Sara and Rebecca at the Richard Prince showing. The paintings\r\n          are all similar to the one we saw in the museum. A series of\r\n          women, peering at the viewer.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          40.\r\n          Rebecca wears her hair up, showing off her earrings. Every\r\n          guy in the room is checking out these two babes. But\r\n          Rebecca's into the art, and Sara is texting Stephen.\r\n          ON CELL PHONE: \"sorry. next time : (\"\r\n          Rebecca notices and frowns. Sara puts the phone away and\r\n          starts studying the paintings.\r\n\r\n          EXT. COLLEGE DORM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          It's night and there's not a soul in sight.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Cuddles lies on top of her, awake.\r\n          Her eyes glowing in the dark. Creepy. But not as creepy as...\r\n          Rebecca in the other bed. She's staring back at the kitten.\r\n          Envy in her eyes. Of Cuddles... or of Sara?\r\n          Rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed. She\r\n          walks over to Sara's bed... but not to pet Cuddles. She\r\n          stands directly above Sara. Looking down at her. If Sara\r\n          would simply open her eyes, she'd see her.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - BARELY SUNRISE\r\n\r\n          Tracy is passed out in her bed. She stirs as she wakes. She\r\n          reaches around her, slapping her end table.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Water. I need water.\r\n          She stumbles to the mini-fridge and looks in: Empty. She\r\n          groans. She grabs an empty cup... opens her door...\r\n          And lets out a sharp little scream.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM - HALLWAY - SAME\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sits right across from Tracy's door, her back against\r\n          the wall. Staring at Tracy.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          41.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Rebecca? What are you doing?\r\n          Rebecca cocks her head at Tracy, as if she's trying to\r\n          comprehend her. A beat. She stands... and walks to her.\r\n          Tracy takes a step back, shaken by Rebecca's calm, morose\r\n          demeanor. Rebecca stares right into her eyes.\r\n          She makes a slight move towards Tracy, who flinches. Rebecca\r\n          turns and walks down to her room. At her door, she turns and\r\n          smiles. She disappears into her room.\r\n          Tracy stands there, spooked.\r\n\r\n          EXT. QUADS - DAY\r\n\r\n          AERIAL VIEW of Sara and Rebecca walking to class. Tracy walks\r\n          ten yards behind them, waiting until...\r\n          Rebecca and Sara wave \"goodbye\" to each other and head down\r\n          different paths. Tracy hurries after Sara and catches up.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey. How was the party? Are you\r\n          still the beer bong queen?\r\n          But Tracy's in no mood to joke. She pulls Sara to a stop.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Listen... something is up with your\r\n          roommate.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What do you mean?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          She was outside my room this\r\n          morning.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Doing what?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Waiting for me. I opened my door...\r\n          and there she was. Just sitting\r\n          there, staring. Like some psycho.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Are you sure?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          42.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          You don't believe me?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          No, it's just... why would she do\r\n          that?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Why don't you ask her? I've gotta\r\n          go...I'll see ya later.\r\n          Tracy stops and watches Sara as she continues on. Tracy\r\n          turns to go the other way, but before she leaves her eyes\r\n          catch Rebecca standing in front of a nearby building.\r\n          Rebecca stares at Tracy much like she did in the hallway.\r\n          Tracy leaves in a hurry.\r\n\r\n          INT. CLASSROOM / STUDIO\r\n\r\n          Sara sits in her Design class. Professor Roberts stands at\r\n          the podium. Three white design mannequins behind him, each\r\n          sporting a different fashion style.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Contrary to popular opinion, beauty\r\n          is not in the eye of the beholder.\r\n          It's in the hands of the designer.\r\n          Sara listens intently, soaking it all in. Her cell buzzes\r\n          with a text message. She discreetly takes a look.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Who can tell me the difference\r\n          between fashion and style?\r\n          FROM IRENE: \"4th & ford. be there now.\" Sara smiles at the\r\n          message.\r\n          Professor Roberts notices Sara looking at her cell phone and\r\n          calls on her.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Miss Matthews?\r\n          Without missing a beat, Sara replies.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Fashion's something you can buy,\r\n          but style you either have or you\r\n          don't.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          43.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Exactly. All the money in the\r\n          world can't buy you style.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          But it can buy you a good stylist.\r\n          The class chuckles. Professor Roberts smiles.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUILDING - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara comes out of the building, texting on her cell as she\r\n          walks.

How'd you know when my class\r\n          got out?\r\n          Rebecca shrugs, playing it off.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm your roommate.\r\n          Sara smiles and grabs a cup.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Thanks.\r\n\r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. QUADS - LATER\r\n\r\n          They walk through the quads. Other students are around, some\r\n          strolling leisurely, others rushing to get to class.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Listen... Tracy told me something\r\n          kinda weird. She says you... scared\r\n          her this morning.\r\n          Rebecca stops and looks at Sara. She starts laughing.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          44.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          It's more like she scared me. She\r\n          was racing to the bathroom like she\r\n          was gonna hurl. She almost knocked\r\n          me over.\r\n          A beat as Sara ponders it all. She smiles.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          The girl does like to party.\r\n          Anyway, I wouldn't worry about it.\r\n          Rebecca takes a victory sip as Sara gets another text from\r\n          Irene: \"where r u?!?!?!\"\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I gotta go meet Irene.\r\n          (raises her cup)\r\n          Thanks for the coffee.\r\n          Rebecca watches her walk off. She takes another sip.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara gets out of a cab. She looks up at a big building.\r\n\r\n          INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks through a design studio. Models and make-up\r\n          artists are rushing around, dragging thousands of dollars\r\n          worth of dresses. Sara loves the place's chaotic energy.\r\n          She knocks on an open door and sees a YOUNG MODEL being\r\n          worked on by a designer who isn't much older. IRENE, 28.\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          (mouth full of pins)\r\n          Finally.\r\n          She gets up to hug Sara. Nearly tearing the dress.\r\n\r\n          INT.

DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          She hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste.\r\n          She removes the towel and steps into the shower, pulling the\r\n          curtain closed. As she shampoos her hair...\r\n          The lights go out.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          You have to be kidding me. Hey!\r\n          The only light is some distorted moonlight through the\r\n          window. Tracy steps out of the shower, grabbing her towel.\r\n          Just as she starts to feel her way along the wall...\r\n          The lights come back on. She sighs happily... sheds her\r\n          towel... and steps back under the steaming water.

What the hell?\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Hey, how about turning on the\r\n          light?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          47.\r\n          No response. Yet another shower turns on.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Who's out there?\r\n          Tracy, back in her towel, nervous now, feels her way along\r\n          the wall again. She turns on the lights.\r\n          The curtains are drawn in front of both running showers.\r\n          Tracy stares at them. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          I know it's you.\r\n          She walks over to the shower. A beat. She rips away one\r\n          curtain. Nothing behind it but the running shower. She turns\r\n          it off. She stares at the other curtain.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Sara thinks you're weird. She told\r\n          me.\r\n          She pulls back the other curtain... nothing. She turns off\r\n          that shower, too. But she can still hear running water.\r\n          She looks back. The curtain from her own shower is closed\r\n          again. The sound of running water behind it.\r\n          She walks over.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Not funny, Rebecca.\r\n          (under her breath)\r\n          Bitch.\r\n          She grips the curtain. She steels herself. She yanks the\r\n          curtain open to see...\r\n          Just running water. Tracy shakes her head. She looks around --\r\n          no one. She slips her towel off and slips back under the\r\n          water. Screw Rebecca -- she's going to finish this shower.\r\n\r\n                         TRACY\r\n          Freak.\r\n          Just as the warm water starts to relax her...\r\n          THE SHOWER CURTAIN CRASHES OVER HER, pile-driven by Rebecca.\r\n          The curtain comes right off the rings.\r\n          Tracy is slammed against the shower wall. She hits the floor\r\n          hard, with Rebecca on top of her. Water pelting them both.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          48.\r\n          Rebecca clamps a hand over Tracy's mouth and pins her against\r\n          the wall. The shower curtain covers her from the neck down.\r\n          Tracy -- wide-eyed and terrified -- stares at Rebecca.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          So Sara thinks I'm weird? Let me\r\n          tell you what I think. I think\r\n          you're a little whore, and a bad\r\n          influence on her. And I think that\r\n          if you tell anyone about... what\r\n          I'm about to do... you'll regret\r\n          it.\r\n          Rebecca, one hand still on Tracy's mouth, slides her other\r\n          hand beneath the shower curtain. Tracy's eyes widen further.\r\n          Rebecca finds what she's looking for... gets the grip she\r\n          needs... and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain.\r\n          A muffled scream from Tracy. Tears stream down her face.\r\n          Rebecca stands. As Tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor,\r\n          Rebecca looks down at...\r\n          The bloody ring in her hand.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Nice belly ring.\r\n          She tosses it to Tracy... and walks away.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara and Stephen are sitting on a couch. His arm around her\r\n          shoulder, lightly playing with the ends of her hair.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          I'm going to flunk my test\r\n          tomorrow, thanks to you.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Then let's make sure it was worth\r\n          it.\r\n          She gives him a slow, lingering kiss.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Duh, joke's on you. I was going to\r\n          flunk anyway.\r\n          She smiles.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          49.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sits on her bed, petting Cuddles, blood still on her\r\n          fingers, humming the tune that Tracy was humming in the\r\n          bathroom. She hears steps and voices in the hallway. She\r\n          smiles -- must be Sara.\r\n          She quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep. But\r\n          the steps pass her door and keep going. Not Sara.\r\n          She turns on the light. Worry in her eyes. She picks up her\r\n          cell phone and dials.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM LOUNGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara and Stephen step off the elevator. Time to say goodbye.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Thanks for helping me... not study.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Anytime.\r\n          He kisses her. Sweet and tender. Until... Sara sees Rebecca.\r\n          Standing just five feet away. Staring at them.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Where were you?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Oh, hi.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I kept calling and calling.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Oh. I turned my cell off at the\r\n          library and forgot to turn it back\r\n          on.\r\n\r\n                         (FRAZZLED)\r\n          Rebecca... this is Stephen.\r\n          He flashes a smile. Rebecca doesn't even look at him.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm going to bed now. I'm glad\r\n          you're okay.\r\n          She walks out of the lounge. A beat. That was awkward. Sara\r\n          bites her lip, as if to say: \"What can you do?\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          50.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          You got a curfew?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Well, she's right...I shoulda\r\n          called.\r\n          He smiles -- no big deal. He kisses her and steps into the\r\n          elevator. They look at each other, waiting for the ancient\r\n          doors to close. Stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more\r\n          kiss. The doors close.\r\n          Sara smiles; what a night. She glances down toward her door\r\n          and sighs.\r\n\r\n          EXT. QUADS - MORNING\r\n\r\n          Sara and Rebecca walk in silence, sipping their coffees.\r\n          Rebecca looks straight ahead, listening to her Walkman. As\r\n          they reach the fork in the path...\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I guess I'll see you later.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Sara...\r\n\r\n                         (SHE TURNS)\r\n          Last night. I was just worried\r\n          about you.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You don't need to worry about me.\r\n          I can take care of myself. Okay?\r\n          Rebecca slowly nods.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Sara. We're good, right?\r\n          A beat. Sara nods and smiles.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara and Stephen at a table, books spread around them.\r\n          Stephen is reading Rolling Stone.\r\n          Sara's on her laptop, checking her Facebook page. She gets a\r\n          message for adding a new friend... from Rebecca. She clicks\r\n          to add her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          51.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library.\r\n          Unbeknownst to Sara and Stephen, Rebecca watches them through\r\n          the glass.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY\r\n\r\n          Sara clicks onto Rebecca's Facebook page. She's listed only\r\n          one friend: Sara. She's posted the picture of her and Sara in\r\n          front of the graffiti wall. And some of her drawings. And a\r\n          picture of a pretty brunette teenager, captioned \"Maria.\"\r\n          Sara looks at Rebecca's interests. Favorite Artist: Richard\r\n          Prince. Favorite Passion: Drawing. Favorite movie: Coyote\r\n          Ugly. Sara smiles. Best Friend: SARA. Her smile fades.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I'm already her best friend?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          That's a little sad.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Stop.\r\n          But the look on her face says she agrees.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Maybe she REALLY likes you...if you\r\n          know what I mean.\r\n          She looks at him quizzically.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I don't.\r\n          He just looks at her, raising his eyebrows suggestively.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          You... are...a...moron.\r\n          He grins.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - PERIODICAL RACKS\r\n\r\n          Rebecca watches Stephen kiss Sara, her expression is tough to\r\n          read. Is she jealous... or entranced? Sara gets up and\r\n          leaves. Stephen goes to the stacks.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          52.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - STACKS - LATER\r\n\r\n          Stephen, alone, searches for a book among the remote stacks.\r\n          The stacks are massive and endless -- row after row of them.\r\n          Stephen thumbs through books, not finding the one he needs.\r\n          He drops a book and bends down to pick it up. Over his\r\n          shoulder, we see...\r\n          REBECCA'S EYES in the space between the shelves. She's in the\r\n          next aisle over.\r\n          Stephen replaces the book. He walks down the aisle, looking\r\n          at the numbers of the books.\r\n          Rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle.\r\n          Her hands gently brush against the books, her eyes on\r\n          Stephen. He turns in her direction and stops in his tracks.\r\n          So does Rebecca. She's completely still.\r\n          Stephen walks over. He puts his hand on the book that covers\r\n          Rebecca. He's about to pull it out and reveal her. But it's\r\n          not the right one. He keeps walking.\r\n          He reaches the end of his aisle... and Rebecca the end of\r\n          hers. She's right around the corner from him. He reads the\r\n          markers at the end of the aisle, trying to figure out which\r\n          direction to go.\r\n          Rebecca's hands are sweaty. She's nervous. Does she want to\r\n          get caught? Stephen turns right, away from her, and starts\r\n          down the next aisle.\r\n          Rebecca softly exhales. And now whispers to herself.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Stephen.\r\n          Stephen stops dead. Did he hear something? Guess not. He\r\n          keeps going, scanning the book numbers again.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Shit, wrong aisle.\r\n          He doubles back, and turns into Rebecca's aisle. But it's...\r\n          EMPTY. We hear a door close in the distance.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          53.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

She's stifling a laugh, much\r\n          more in control as Stephen is straining.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          54.\r\n          He tries to swing his legs and kick her. She avoids him. He\r\n          catches a peek at her bare midriff. Finally, this makes him\r\n          fall. She then lets go, victorious.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          I was a gymnast until I hit a\r\n          growth spurt my freshman year.\r\n          Stephen brushes himself off. Dejected that he was \"this\r\n          close\". She walks up to him. Cocky. Gives him a playful\r\n          shove.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          So I win.\r\n          He gives her a playful shove back.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          So.\r\n          She seductively walks back towards him.

DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sketches in her bed. She looks at the clock: 1:00\r\n          a.m. And no Sara. History is repeating itself.. .and Rebecca's\r\n          pissed. She rips out her sketch page and throws it away.\r\n          She starts pacing the floor. She angrily moves Sara's chair\r\n          back to her side. She whips out her phone and eyes the dial\r\n          button. She starts to dial... but kills the call.\r\n          She picks up her sketchpad again. Suddenly:\r\n          A BUZZING SOUND from Sara's desk. Rebecca pulls out the desk\r\n          drawer and finds Sara's cell phone. On the call screen:\r\n\r\n          \"JASON\".\r\n          A long beat.

At his door... he cracks\r\n          it open and peeks inside.\r\n          His room is a disaster. Definitely a new world record for\r\n          empty beer cans, pizza boxes, and strewn clothes.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Just give me thirty seconds.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You're kidding.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          56.\r\n          But he slips into the room and closes the door behind him.\r\n          Sara leans back against the wall. Flushed, breathing hard.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - SAME\r\n\r\n          Stephen is a whirlwind.

He catches it, shocked. He\r\n          tosses it aside and yanks her into the room. The door slams\r\n          shut behind them.\r\n\r\n          INT.

So you wouldn't have\r\n          to get a new roommate. Her place is\r\n          huge and it's not like you couldn't\r\n          use the extra closet space. I'd\r\n          just move some of my stuff over,\r\n          and spend a few nights a week\r\n          there.

A beat of awkward silence.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Nothing's set in stone. It's just\r\n          something to think about. Plus we'd\r\n          be able to keep Cuddles.\r\n          As Sara hangs more new clothes in her closet, Rebecca stares\r\n          across the room at...\r\n          Cuddles.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

In charge,\r\n          moving with a purpose.\r\n          She snatches an issue of High Times from her co-worker's hand\r\n          and points him toward the sink.

As she\r\n          carries it toward the door, she passes Cuddles, curled up on\r\n          Sara's bed.

They're dry, with two minutes\r\n          still left on the timer. She stuffs the clothes into her\r\n          duffle bag. She walks to the washers and picks up Cuddles.\r\n          She pets her gently.\r\n          She walks back to the dryer and places Cuddles inside.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (BABY TALK)\r\n          See how nice and warm it is in\r\n          there?\r\n          Cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth.

Flips over.\r\n          The dryer beeps. OUT OF TIME. Cuddles meows at Rebecca,\r\n          wanting out. She reaches into her pocket... and pulls out her\r\n          last quarter. She gently places it in the slot.\r\n          ON DRYER DISPLAY: 15 MINUTES. Rebecca stares through the\r\n          glass at the kitten.

You'd\r\n          have to earn it, Sara.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Of course. I'll do... anything.\r\n          Roberts stands and walks to the window. He looks out at the\r\n          quad... and now turns back to Sara.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          I'd like to see more danger in your\r\n          work. Your designs are always\r\n          crisp; they're always clear. But\r\n          they're a little... safe.\r\n          That stung. Sara can't keep the red from rising in her face.\r\n          Roberts walks over to her.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Don't be afraid to go to some of\r\n          the...\r\n          He delicately taps her temple.\r\n\r\n          PROFESSOR ROBERTS (CONT'D)\r\n          darker places in here.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Okay...\r\n          He squats beside her, his hand on her shoulder now. He looks\r\n          into her eyes.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          The best designers push the\r\n          boundaries of what's... acceptable.\r\n          They take chances. Do you like to\r\n          take chances, Sara?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Sometimes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          71.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          So do I.\r\n          He kisses her. Sara pushes him away, jumping out of her\r\n          chair. She stands in front of him, shaking.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I can't believe you just did that.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          I took a chance, that's all. With a\r\n          student that I trust.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I better go.\r\n          Sara grabs her books. As she heads for the door...\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Paris, Sara. Fashion Week. Don't\r\n          blow the chance of a lifetime.\r\n          She hurries out of the office.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sits alone at a study table. Sara walks up and drops\r\n          down her books. THUD. Students look over from other tables.\r\n          Sara doesn't care. She sits down and stares blankly into\r\n          space, trying to forget what just happened. Rebecca leans\r\n          over, concerned.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          What's wrong?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          My design professor just kissed me.\r\n          Rebecca turns very serious. She gets up and sits down next\r\n          to Sara.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Are you alright?\r\n          Sara nods.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Yeah, it just really creeped me\r\n          out. And I think the asshole's\r\n          married.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          72.\r\n          Rebecca puts her hand on Sara's.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Professor Roberts at his desk, set to call it a day. He\r\n          tosses some design sheets into his briefcase.\r\n          He opens a desk drawer... grabs his wedding ring... and slips\r\n          it onto his finger.\r\n          He hears FOOTSTEPS in the hallway. The sexy, unmistakable\r\n          clicking of a woman's heels. They come closer... and now stop\r\n          at his door.\r\n          Roberts watches the door, waiting for a knock. Nothing. He\r\n          walks to it. He can see the silhouette of two feet at the\r\n          bottom of the door. He smiles -- Sara, coming back to him.\r\n          He opens the door, revealing:\r\n          Rebecca. She wears a snug v-neck cardigan, skin-tight black\r\n          jeans, and silver stiletto heels. A small purse on her\r\n          shoulder.\r\n          Roberts swallows his surprise.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Professor Roberts?\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          That's right.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm glad I caught you.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Actually, I was just...\r\n          But Rebecca steps past him into the office, her heels\r\n          snapping on the worn hardwood floor.\r\n\r\n          INT. OFFICE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Roberts, a little annoyed but also intrigued, follows her\r\n          back inside. They face each other.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          You're not one of my students.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Not yet. That's why I'm here.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          73.\r\n          She steps to his desk and leans against it. Her cool manner\r\n          is disarming. A beat.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm failing Intro Pysch.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          And why is that?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Because I'm bored. I thought it\r\n          would be all about Freud, and deep\r\n          dark secrets. But it's brain\r\n          chemistry. Synapses. I can't stay\r\n          awake in class.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          I'm sorry to hear that. But I'm not\r\n          sure what I can do to help.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Tomorrow's the last day to drop a\r\n          course without penalty. Unless I\r\n          can add another one in its place,\r\n          I'll fall way behind in credits.\r\n          Daddy won't take that very well. He\r\n          might even pull the plug. Which\r\n          means...\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I'm pretty much at your mercy,\r\n          Professor.\r\n          Roberts smiles. This girl is a trip. Is she for real? She's\r\n           so calm, so steady. Roberts can't get a handle on her.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Look, I've always made it a policy\r\n          not to accept any students this\r\n          late in the term.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Do I look like just any student to\r\n          you?\r\n          She smiles... and eases up onto his desk. Facing him. Pretty\r\n          feet dangling, ankles locked. Jesus.\r\n          She eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk. She\r\n          sees the framed picture of a WOMAN AND TWO KIDS. She picks it\r\n          up.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Your wife is very pretty.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          74.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Ex-wife .\r\n           The game is on now. Roberts slowly walks around the desk,\r\n          until he's behind Rebecca.\r\n           In the picture frame's reflection, Rebecca sees him slip off\r\n          his wedding ring. He palms it.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          A few things I'd need to know.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Ask me anything.\r\n          He's circling the desk now. Predator and prey.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Do you have any design experience?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          None.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          What do you know about clothes?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Only one thing.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          And what's that?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I definitely look better out of\r\n          them than in them.\r\n          What an answer. Roberts stops in front of her. He moves in\r\n           close, between her parting legs. He looks into her eyes.\r\n          Still steady.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          I think we might be able to work\r\n          something out.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Great. Just tell me and I'll do\r\n          anything.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Kiss me.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I'll take it from there.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          75.\r\n          He kisses her. She opens her lips for a tantalizing second,\r\n          and now gently pushes him away. He holds his ground. He's had\r\n          a taste -- he wants a lot more.\r\n          Suddenly, Rebecca's face hardens.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Ow! You're hurting me! Professor,\r\n          stop!...\r\n          Roberts stares at her in shock. He's not even touching her.\r\n          What's going on? Rebecca smiles again.\r\n          This girl is whacked. But damn, Roberts wants her. And her\r\n          eyes are inviting him back. As he presses in to kiss her\r\n          again...\r\n          She rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the\r\n          floor, gasping for air. He drops his wedding ring, which\r\n          rolls away across the floor.\r\n          Rebecca steps to the desk, where her purse sits open. We can\r\n          see the Walkman inside. She takes it out. Smiles at him.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Birthday gift. You should get one,\r\n          they're great.\r\n          She slips on the earbuds... plays with the Walkman for a few\r\n          seconds... and now hits the play button. We hear their prior\r\n          conversation, played back.\r\n\r\n                         WALKMAN\r\n          Great. Just tell me and I'll do\r\n          anything.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Kiss me. I'll take it from there.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Owl You're hurting me! Professor,\r\n          stop!...\r\n          Rage and betrayal in Roberts' eyes.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          You bitch tease!\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Oh, I'm not teasing.\r\n          She starts to circle him now, as he writhes in pain on the\r\n          floor.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          76.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Do you see enough danger in me now,\r\n          Professor? Did I go to a dark\r\n          enough place for you?\r\n          He recognizes his own words to Sara.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          What? How did?... Who are you?\r\n          He lunges at her ankle. She steps out of his grasp... and\r\n          slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand. He yells\r\n          again.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          She trusted you.\r\n          She walks toward the door.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR ROBERTS\r\n          Please don't do this. Twenty years.\r\n          Everything I worked for. I'll pay\r\n          for that tape.\r\n           Rebecca stops at the door. She kneels, picks up his wedding\r\n           ring, and rolls it across the floor to him.\r\n\r\n                          REBECCA\r\n           Yes you will.\r\n           She walks out the door.\r\n\r\n          INT.

She is looking out the window,\r\n          holding a theory book in her hand.\r\n          Stephen watches her from his side of the bed.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Anything wrong?\r\n          Sara is taken out of her own world\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Are you ok?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Yeah, sure.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          77.\r\n          She smiles. Stephen smiles back.\r\n          Sara looks down in her book again.\r\n\r\n          EXT. QUADS - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara looks up at the building. She sighs before she enters.\r\n\r\n          INT. HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          She walks slowly toward the classroom, letting other students\r\n          pass her. She steps into the doorway and sees...\r\n\r\n          INT. CLASSROOM\r\n\r\n          A WOMAN, standing at Professor Roberts' podium. She gestures\r\n          for everyone to come in. Sara, like the rest, is confused.\r\n\r\n                         WOMAN\r\n          Welcome. I'm Professor Jacobs. I'll\r\n          be taking over the class for the\r\n          rest of the semester.\r\n          Sara can't believe it.

CAFETERIA - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks in with a tray, still a bit dazed. She sees a half-\r\n          dozen hallmates milling about and Rebecca sitting by herself\r\n          in the corner, drawing. Sara joins her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Remember what I told you about\r\n          Professor Roberts?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Yeah?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          He's gone.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          What do you mean?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          78.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Well, they're calling it a leave of\r\n          absence.

CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara serves up two fresh lattes... and now leans against the\r\n          counter to watch the band. Stephen's band.

A very strange expression in\r\n          her eyes. She looks herself over, makes a fist, and now...\r\n          Punches herself on the temple. Hard. She staggers, nearly\r\n          knocked out. She straightens. Looks in the mirror. Her skin\r\n          is already bruising. She punches herself again. Same spot.\r\n          And again, with her other fist this time. And now a shot to\r\n          her shoulder. And another. It's painful to watch. But she's\r\n          getting more and more numb to the blows.\r\n          She inspects herself closely... and now reaches down and\r\n          grabs an artist's UTILITY KNIFE. It looks like a large,\r\n          retractable box cutter. She extends the blade all the way\r\n          out. She pulls up her shirt. Turns to the side a bit. Places\r\n          the knife against her skin and...\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          80.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara opens the door and finds Rebecca curled up in a fetal\r\n          position in a corner of the room. Sobbing. Sara drops her\r\n          things and runs over to her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Oh my God. What happened?\r\n          She cradles Rebecca, who buries her head in between her\r\n          knees. Sara checks the bruises on her head and arms.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca. It's okay. You're safe\r\n          now. Talk to me.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I was looking for Cuddles. A man...\r\n          pulled me into an alley. He\r\n          tried...\r\n          Sara holds her. She can't finish.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          It's okay. It's okay.

She\r\n          pulls it up and sees a slash. Gasps.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Rebecca, newly showered, hair still wet, sits on her bed in\r\n          her underwear. Sara is tending to her wounds. Ice for the\r\n          bruises. Disinfectant for the cut. Rebecca flinches.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          It's not deep, thank God. But you\r\n          should see a doctor.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          No.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca, you need to.

I can't.\r\n          Sara pulls out her cell phone.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You're calling them, or I am.\r\n          There's a psycho walking around\r\n          this campus.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (CRYING AGAIN)\r\n          Please.

Just let\r\n          me help you.\r\n          Rebecca calms down. Let's Sara finish. Watching her intently\r\n          as she works.\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - DORM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara's on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with Stephen.\r\n          Inside, the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go\r\n          home for the holiday.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Sorry about not staying.

Yeah it is.\r\n          Sara looks out the window. Rebecca shows a hint of a smile.\r\n\r\n          EXT. GATED MANSION - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Rebecca's car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion\r\n          that could be straight out of Lifestyles of the Rich and\r\n          Famous.\r\n\r\n          EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Rebecca and Sara stand in the driveway, looking up at the\r\n          mansion.

Rebecca's on edge, flinching as\r\n          Sara closes the door.\r\n          Rebecca's parents rush in from the living room.

Her mom gives\r\n          her a tender, protracted embrace. Rebecca endures it, barely\r\n          raising her arms.\r\n\r\n                         DAD\r\n          Hello.

Sara looks around. It's a\r\n          typical teenage girl's bedroom. Except, no posters. Just\r\n          drawings covering the walls. The drawings are of teenage\r\n          girls -- more precisely, they're different drawings of one\r\n          teenage girl. They're odd, but compelling.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          These are interesting.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Yeah, some of my high school work.\r\n          I haven't gotten around to takin\r\n          them down.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Sara has made a\r\n          makeshift bed in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          We can share the bed if you want.\r\n          Sara looks down at her own \"bed\" and takes a glance at the\r\n          walls. On the floor, she's going to be surrounded by the\r\n          drawings of Rebecca looking at her.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Sure.\r\n          Sara climbs into bed with Rebecca. They lay back to back.\r\n          Rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Thanks for coming.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Next Thanksgiving, you can run\r\n          interference with my family.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Done.\r\n          Sara closes her eyes. It's silent. Rebecca turns over. A\r\n          beat. She opens her eyes -- just inches from Sara. She ever\r\n          so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes Sara's hair.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          86.\r\n          Sara opens her eyes for a second. Not sure if she felt\r\n          something. She closes them again.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen. He's\r\n          lived here long enough to know his way in the dark.\r\n\r\n                         KITCHEN\r\n          Jeff opens the fridge. The soft light barely illuminates\r\n          Rebecca, sitting stoically at the table behind her father.\r\n          Jeff jumps. He recovers, standing by the open fridge.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          Becs. You scared me.\r\n          Rebecca, glass of milk in her hand, gives her father a dirty\r\n          look. We know how much she hates nicknames.\r\n\r\n          INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara wakes up alone in bed. She can hear soft voices from\r\n          downstairs. She climbs out of bed and walks to the door.\r\n\r\n          INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara stands at the top of the stairs. She walks down them and\r\n          to the kitchen doorway. She peeks inside to see...\r\n\r\n          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca and her father sitting at the table. Just the\r\n          moonlight through the window falling over them. Spooky.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          How're you doing?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Fine. My grades are good.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          That's not what I meant.\r\n          She looks down at the table.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          87.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm making friends.\r\n          Jeff, very subtly, cringes. A long beat.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          Rebecca, look at me for a second.\r\n          Now she looks at him.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          Your mother and I are very fond of\r\n          you.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I know.\r\n          He doesn't know what else to say.\r\n          Outside Sara sees the framed photos on the wall.\r\n          Each features Rebecca's parents in some exotic locale: On the\r\n          beach... on the ski slopes... on a cruise ship. They smile\r\n          happily at the camera. Rebecca isn't in a single picture.\r\n\r\n                         JEFF\r\n          I just wanted to make sure. Good\r\n          night, I'm heading back to bed.\r\n          He rises. Sara turns and walks up the stairs.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRONT DOOR - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara waits by the front door. Alison walks in.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Hi Sara.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hi. Rebecca's going to show me some\r\n          of her high school hangouts.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Wonderful.\r\n          Alison peers up the stairs.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Rebecca seems to be doing well.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Uhhh, yeah. I think she is.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          88.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Is she taking her medication?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Medication?\r\n          Alison turns to see... her daughter at the top of the stairs.\r\n          Did she hear them? She walks down.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Hey sweetheart.\r\n          She kisses her on the cheek. Rebecca is annoyed.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (TO SARA)\r\n          Ready?\r\n          Sara nods, but she's still reeling from Alison's words.\r\n          Medication? She looks back, but Alison waves cheerfully.\r\n\r\n                         ALISON\r\n          Have a great time, you two.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n          It's an affluent but quaint little town's main street.\r\n          Rebecca and Sara stroll down the sidewalk. Sara cuts\r\n          discreet, sideways glances at Rebecca.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Is everything okay?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Yeah. It's just...\r\n          She wants to ask her about that medication.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Nice to see where you come from.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (EMBARRASSED)\r\n          Come on.\r\n\r\n          INT. COFFEE SHOP DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara and Rebecca are in line for their drinks. The TEENAGE\r\n          CASHIER takes their money... but keeps staring at Rebecca.\r\n          She doesn't pay any attention to him. Sara takes her coffee.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          89.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Thanks.\r\n          The cashier stares at her, as if trying to figure Sara out.\r\n          What's she doing with Rebecca?\r\n          The girls sit at a table. The cashier and BARISTA keep\r\n          glancing over, whispering to each other. Rebecca shoots them\r\n          a look. Like a warning. They quiet. Start doing busy work.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (TO SARA)\r\n          I used to come here like every day\r\n          after school.\r\n          The door opens. THREE GIRLS walk in, laughing and chatting.\r\n          One BRUNETTE spots Rebecca and stops dead in her tracks.\r\n          Sara recognizes her. It's MARIA, the girl from Rebecca's\r\n          Facebook, and the subject of all those wall sketches.\r\n          The chatting girls all fall silent.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          You know them?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          They went to my high school.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Friends?\r\n          Rebecca doesn't answer her. She's focused on making eye\r\n          contact with the Brunette.\r\n          The girls linger by the door, whispering among themselves.\r\n          Finally, the Brunette sits down at a table by the entrance.\r\n          As far away from Rebecca's and Sara's table as possible.\r\n          The other two girls walk to the counter. They sneak glances\r\n          at Rebecca as they order their drinks.\r\n          Sara looks back and forth between Rebecca and the girls.\r\n          Rebecca doesn't waver. She keeps staring at the Brunette.\r\n          Suddenly, Rebecca gets up.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Let's leave.\r\n          Rebecca walks towards the door. Sara, confused, gathers her\r\n          things and gets up. Rebecca stops at the Brunette's table.\r\n          The Brunette sits there, like a deer caught in headlights.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          90.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Hello, Maria.\r\n\r\n                         MARIA\r\n\r\n                         (WARY)\r\n          Hello.\r\n          The other girls walk over. Rebecca, unfazed, looks them over,\r\n          sending shivers down their spines. They want to back up their\r\n          friend, but they look as scared as she does. Sara watches all\r\n          this from a few feet away.\r\n          Rebecca suddenly turns cheerful.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Oh, I wanted to introduce you to\r\n          Sara. My roommate.\r\n          Sara gives a small wave to Maria, who looks her over. Almost\r\n          as if she feels sorry for her.\r\n\r\n                         MARIA\r\n          Hi.\r\n          Rebecca keeps eyeing Maria, a superior grin on her face. An\r\n          awkward beat. Everyone's tense. Sara clears her throat.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Well, we better go.\r\n          Rebecca snaps out of it. Nods. They start to walk out. But as\r\n          they open the door...\r\n\r\n                         MARIA\r\n          Rebecca.\r\n          Everyone turns to Maria. She looks Rebecca in the eye.\r\n\r\n                         MARIA\r\n          We were never friends.\r\n          Rebecca stares at her, grinding her teeth. The tension\r\n          building. Maria doesn't back down, though. She needed to say\r\n          this. Sara grabs Rebecca's shoulder, gently.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Come on, let's go.\r\n\r\n          INT. CAR - DAY: DRIVING\r\n\r\n          Headed back to school. Sara looks out the window. Lost in\r\n          thought.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          91.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I guess college is a fresh start\r\n          for both of us.\r\n          Rebecca doesn't look at her. Just a hint of acknowledgement\r\n          on her face.\r\n          Sara's phone buzzes. This gets Rebecca's attention. Sara\r\n          looks at the text message she just received from Irene:\r\n          \"back in LA. lemme know abt movin in.\"\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Irene's back in town.\r\n          Sara types and sends a text back. Rebecca watches her.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CAMPUS QUAD - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara's running through the quad.\r\n\r\n          EXT./INT. DORM - DAY\r\n\r\n          Sara, coming in from a run, times it perfectly, sneaking in\r\n          the front door as a student walks out. She bypasses the\r\n          elevator, heading straight to the stairs.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY - DAY\r\n\r\n          She bursts out the door and into the hallway.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - DAY\r\n\r\n          She walks in, still a bit out of breath. Rebecca is packing\r\n          her back-pack.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          (not looking up)\r\n          Good run?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          (between deep breaths)\r\n          Great. You wanna go get dinner?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I'm going to the art studio.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Oh. Okay. Catch you later then.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          92.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Don't wait up, Sara...\r\n\r\n                         (GRINS)\r\n          I feel inspired.\r\n          She's out the door. Sara notices that Rebecca left her\r\n          sketchpad behind on her bed. She eyes it for a beat. Looks at\r\n          the closed door.\r\n          As she steps toward the sketchpad... Rebecca charges back in.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Forgot my pad.\r\n          She snags it from her bed and leaves. Sara eyes Rebecca's\r\n          dresser. But first... She walks to the door and opens it.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the\r\n          empty hallway. She hears the elevator ding.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara heads straight for Rebecca's dresser. A beat. Is she\r\n          really going to do this? Yes. She slides open the top drawer:\r\n          Supplies. The second drawer: sketchpads. She leafs through\r\n          them: Empty.\r\n          She searches the third drawer: Sweaters. She feels around\r\n          beneath them. Wait a minute. She pulls out:\r\n          Two bottles of prescription medicine. \"LITHIUM... For APD.\"\r\n          Both bottles are full of pills. As Sara stares at them...\r\n\r\n          A HAND TAPS HER SHOULDER.\r\n          She leaps out of her socks. But it's just Stephen.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Your door was open.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Oh my God.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Sorry.\r\n          Sara grabs him and gives him a long hug. Stephen holds her\r\n          tight and speaks, muffled by her neck.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          93.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          What are those?\r\n          A beat. Should she bring him into this?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          That's what I intend to find out.\r\n\r\n          INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca is standing up, back pack around her shoulder, her\r\n          drawing pad in her other hand. Her arm is wrapped around a\r\n          pole for balance. She stares out the window. No emotion. She\r\n          looks like she's staring at her own reflection. The train\r\n          comes to a halt. Riders shuffle around.\r\n          Rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down. She opens her\r\n          drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper. She looks\r\n          up and we see what she's been staring at:\r\n          Irene.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara and Stephen stand at Sara's desk, over her computer.\r\n          Sara googles \"Lithium and APD\", and clicks on an entry.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (READING)\r\n          APD -- anti-social personality\r\n          disorder.

NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A stylish, hip night club. A sophisticated crowd. Irene and\r\n          three FRIENDS sit in the lounge section, sipping exotic\r\n          martinis and watching the dance floor.\r\n          And on that dance floor one particular woman dances by\r\n          herself, lost in the music, oblivious to everything around\r\n          her. She turns as she dances and we see that it's Rebecca.\r\n          Irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom. As she winds\r\n          her away around the borders of the dance floor, she notices\r\n          Rebecca. She pauses to watch her. THEIR EYES MEET FOR MORE\r\n\r\n          THAN AN INSTANT, IRENE SMILES AND WALKS AWAY. REBECCA CLOCKS\r\n\r\n          IT, WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?\r\n\r\n          INT. NIGHT CLUB - BATHROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Irene stands at the mirror, fixing her make-up. The door\r\n          opens and closes. She glances over to see Rebecca walking in.\r\n          Rebecca steps to the sink, just a few feet down from Irene.\r\n          She's out of breath, a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms.\r\n          Irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss. Rebecca is watching her\r\n          in the mirror, and Irene knows it. She applies the gloss and\r\n          smiles at the little kick it gives her. Her eyes find\r\n          Rebecca's in the mirror.\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          I'm sorry to stare, but you are so\r\n          beautiful.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA SMILES\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Thanks.

A girl\r\n          never knows how late she's gonna\r\n          party.\r\n          Rebecca smiles.

Rebecca takes her hand and\r\n          pulls her close. She kisses Irene full on the lips.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          You're right... cinnamon.\r\n          Irene smiles.\r\n          This room's heating up fast. Irene's eyes meet Rebecca's.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Why don't we get out of here.

IRENE'S BEDROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n          An alarm clock buzzes with no effect to Irene who is dead to\r\n          the world. She grunts and finally opens her eyes. She wipes\r\n          the sleep from her eyes, she looks around confused, looks to\r\n          the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent\r\n          the night. Irene sits up and turns off the alarm..\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          Shit.\r\n          She looks at an empty glass on her bedside table.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT.

It's quiet for a moment. She drinks. She fills the\r\n          glass again.\r\n          Irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand. She\r\n          switches off the light in the kitchen. But as she starts to\r\n          go back to her room ...WHAM!!\r\n          Rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into Irene.\r\n\r\n          CLOSE UP: GLASS EXPLODES ON THE FLOOR\r\n\r\n          EXT.

She's wearing a sportsbra, revealing her\r\n          tattoo. Sara grabs a robe.\r\n          A beat. She's nervous, but she needs to do this. Time for the\r\n          \"big talk.\" She sits on her bed and faces Rebecca.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA --\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I want a tattoo.\r\n\r\n                         (SARA'S SHOCKED)\r\n          Will you come with me?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Uhhh...\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Please.

And Rebecca can't believe it. She's that far gone.\r\n          Her eyes search Sara's for an answer.\r\n          Sara abruptly turns and walks out the door.

Bumping into\r\n          people as she looks around, making sure she'll spot Rebecca\r\n          before Rebecca spots her.\r\n          She makes it to the front door of the building. She looks\r\n          back at the quads.\r\n\r\n          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara locks the front door and heads back home.\r\n          She walks down an empty quad. She slows at the sight of...\r\n          Rebecca. Walking directly towards her from the other end of\r\n          the quad.\r\n          No one else is in sight. Sara thinks about veering off to the\r\n          side. No. She can do this. She walks straight ahead. Rebecca\r\n          keeps her pace; hooded sweater up, looking down at the\r\n          pavement, listening to her Walkman.\r\n          Sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other,\r\n          preparing herself for the confrontation. Ten feet away now.\r\n          Five...\r\n          But Rebecca passes her without looking. Sara walks a little\r\n          further and turns around.\r\n          Rebecca keeps walking. Did she even see her?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          102.\r\n\r\n          EXT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara reaches Psi U. and closes the door behind her. She looks\r\n          around at the messy first floor. At the PACK OF GUYS in the\r\n          living room, yelling at the hoops game on TV.\r\n          Sara smiles. She's safe.\r\n\r\n          INT. ART STUDIO - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca is alone, with just a crack of light coming from the\r\n          open door to the hallway. She's sketching, still wearing her\r\n          Walkman. Hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the\r\n          floor, but we can't see what she's drawing.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE ROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from\r\n          outside the room is too loud. Stephen is on the bed,\r\n          reading. He's used to it. She hears a loud commotion from\r\n          the hallway. Frustrated, she gets up.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          It's a couple of guys playing nerf basketball.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Seriously. Is it a game to be as\r\n          loud as you possibly can?\r\n          She waves her arms like a crazy person.\r\n\r\n                         SARA (CONT'D)\r\n          How many walls can you possibly\r\n          bump into!?\r\n          They just return blank stares. She slams the door shut.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to\r\n          shout down the hall. Stephen eyes her warily. Her cellphone\r\n          rings. She pulls it out of the purse: Jason.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          103.\r\n          She hesitates... and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as\r\n          she gets up from the table.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey, I'm going to hit the library.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n\r\n                         (GETTING UP)\r\n          I can walk you there.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          No, it's okay.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Party starts at ten. Really cool\r\n          band...\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          I hear the drummer's really hot.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          He may be, but I'm sleeping with\r\n          his girlfriend...\r\n          She kisses him.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DORM - EVENING - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          JASON, a handsome all-American Midwestern kid, stands in\r\n          front of Sara's dorm. He's talking into his cell phone.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Sara. I'm actually... I'm in front\r\n          of your dorm. I just flew in. I'm\r\n          at the Roosevelt Hotel, room 210.\r\n          Call me, okay?\r\n          He hangs up. Some students leave the dorm and he grabs the\r\n          door before it closes.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - DUSK\r\n\r\n          Rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser. Opens the bottom\r\n          drawer. Her sweaters. She fishes underneath them. Pulls out\r\n          her lithium pills. But just looks at them. Anger in her eyes.\r\n          She puts the bottle back.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          104.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Jason walks through the hallway, checking the numbers on the\r\n          doors. He stops in front of Sara's room. Knocks lightly on\r\n          the door. No answer. Knocks again.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca sits back into Sara's chair, staring at the door,\r\n          ignoring the knocks. Almost catatonic.\r\n          Her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest,\r\n          shredding it to pieces.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Jason writes a note. He folds it and slides it under the\r\n          door. He hesitates for a second, hoping this is the right\r\n          thing to do, then walks back down the hallway towards the\r\n          elevator.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca stares at the note for a moment. She walks to the\r\n          door, picks it up and begins to read Jason's note.\r\n\r\n                         SARA -\r\n          I know you won't take my calls, but I'm here and I just want\r\n          to see you. I'm at The Roosevelt Hotel, Room 210, until...\r\n          however long it takes. Please.\r\n          Love,\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM - SHOWER - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca lets the water soak her. Eyes open. She runs her\r\n          fingers through her now long dark brown hair. Black water\r\n          trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          105.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM BATHROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror, staring at her\r\n          reflection. She then digs into her bag and pulls out a long\r\n          pair of shears. Her \"Emily\" tattoo is starting to heal. She\r\n          gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears,\r\n          still looking at it in the mirror.\r\n          She lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter.\r\n          Just above her shoulders.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca walks over to Sara's closet. She opens it and thumbs\r\n          through some of the clothes that Sara left behind. She pulls\r\n          out a dress. Holds it in front of herself as she stands in\r\n          front of the mirror. Nice -- but something's missing.\r\n          Rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out Sara's silver chain.\r\n          Which she caresses in her hand.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara's kicked her feet on the table, reading a book.\r\n          Enjoying the silence.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          A raucous party in full swing. Stephen's band has just\r\n          finished playing and he's walking off the cheap stage. A HOT\r\n          GIRL smiles at him.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n          Help me find the keg?\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Sure, I have to go look for my\r\n          girlfriend anyway.\r\n          She walks away. \"Jerk\". He grins... and now checks his watch.\r\n          Where's Sara?\r\n\r\n          INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The elevator door opens, revealing Rebecca. Or is it Sara?\r\n          The hair. The dress. The tattoo. Rebecca looks just like her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          106.\r\n          As she steps into the hallway, she gently fingers the\r\n          necklace. She walks along, looking at the room numbers.\r\n          She stops in front of a room. She's about to knock... but she\r\n          sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down, in front of an\r\n          open room.\r\n          She walks to the cart. She peeks inside the room... and now\r\n          plucks the master key card off the cart.\r\n\r\n          INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Jason, shirtless, sleeps on his stomach in bed.\r\n          The front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for\r\n          a silhouette of a woman to appear. She closes the door. Jason\r\n          barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep.\r\n          Rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight. She stares\r\n          down at Jason. She slips off her dress, which falls to the\r\n          floor. She's in just bra and panties now.\r\n          She climbs onto the bed beside Jason. He starts awake.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n\r\n                         WHA--\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Shhhh.\r\n          She crawls onto him, not letting him turn over. She starts\r\n          kissing the back of his neck.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Sara?\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          You got my voicemail.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Mm-hmmm.\r\n          Kissing his back now, moving lower.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          Oh, man, Sara. Oh, that feels good.\r\n          She works her way back up to his ear.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERING)\r\n          Turn over.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          107.\r\n          Did that sound like Sara? But as Jason turns over, he sees...\r\n          The hair. The necklace. That unmistakable \"Emily\" tattoo.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERING)\r\n          Close your eyes.\r\n          He does. She reaches beneath the blanket, and does what she\r\n          needs to. She settles onto him. And now starts to move.\r\n          And as she moves we go behind her and see, shining in the low\r\n          light, the utility knife beneath her bra strap. Flat against\r\n          the skin of her back.\r\n          Jason lies still, eyes clenched shut.\r\n\r\n                         JASON\r\n          I love you, Sara.\r\n          She lets him have one, two, three seconds of heaven. Her\r\n          hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          But she doesn't love you.\r\n          Jason's eyes fly open. That wasn't Sara's voice. And those\r\n          aren't Sara's eyes boring into his.\r\n          Rebecca leans down, her face to his. Jason's eyes widen in\r\n          shock, horror, and now pain as her unseen hands drive the\r\n          knife deep into his gut. He gasps.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          You hurt her.\r\n          She kisses him -- the last thing he'll ever feel. He\r\n          shudders, trembles, and lies still, eyes open.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara's still reading. A hand touches her shoulder. She jumps,\r\n          but it's just the LIBRARIAN.\r\n\r\n                         LIBRARIAN\r\n          We're about to close.\r\n          Sara can't believe it's so late. She puts her things away.\r\n          Grabs her phone to check the time, distracted by the \"1 new\r\n          voicemail\" message. She's about to press the voicemail\r\n          button...\r\n          But a text comes in from Irene:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          108.\r\n          \"Im back.

FRATHOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Stephen walks around, beer-less, searching the crowd for\r\n          Sara. He checks his watch. Pats his pocket -- no cell phone.\r\n          He heads up the stairs and into his room.\r\n\r\n          INT. FRAT BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Stephen picks his phone off the dresser. Sees he has a new\r\n          voicemail from Sara. He plays the message\r\n\r\n          SARA (V.0.)\r\n          Hi Stephen, it's me. I'm stopping\r\n          by Irene's, come on by. I want you\r\n           guys to meet ...it's on 524 South\r\n          Grand, Apt. 708. Love you.\r\n          He groans. A sharp knock, and the bedroom door opens.\r\n\r\n                         FRAT BOY\r\n          All hands on deck -- the keg's\r\n          still alive.\r\n\r\n          EXT. IRENE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara comes fast-paced down the sidewalk. She enters Irene's\r\n          building.\r\n\r\n          INT. IRENE'S ELEVATOR\r\n\r\n          Sara rides up the elevator.\r\n\r\n          INT. HALLWAY / DOORWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara walks to the door of Irene's apartment. It's open but\r\n          there's not a sound. No music, no cocktail chatter.\r\n          She checks the apartment number again. It's the right one.\r\n          She knocks lightly. No answer.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Irene?\r\n\r\n          INT.

Dark and empty. Sara's starting to feel uneasy.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Irene?\r\n          There's a bedroom dead ahead. Warm light pours out. She\r\n          slowly walks to the open door... looks in... and freezes.\r\n          CLOSE ON SARA'S EYES. Horror-stricken by what she sees.\r\n          The bedroom is dark, except for the single lamp, above...\r\n          Irene. She lies on the bed, each of her wrists cuffed to a\r\n          bedpost. A red Hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth.\r\n          Sara can't move. She stares at Irene in shock.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (WHISPERING)\r\n          Irene.\r\n          Irene mumbles, her eyes wide open in terror. As Sara starts\r\n          toward Irene...\r\n\r\n          REBECCA (O.S.)\r\n          Some role model she turned out to\r\n          be. Couldn't even take care of\r\n          herself.\r\n          Rebecca steps out of the darkness, a gun in her hand. Sara\r\n          drops her phone on the floor.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca!\r\n          Rebecca holds the gun steady on Sara.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Sit down and shut up.\r\n          Sara lowers herself into a black chair, her eyes on Irene.\r\n          Rebecca picks up Sara's cell phone.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Listen to me. All I ever wanted\r\n          was to be your friend.\r\n          A beat. Sara knows she has to play this just right.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca, you are my friend.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          110.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          No. Shut up. We're not friends.\r\n          We're here because you betrayed me.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca, I'm sorry--\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Stop it. Stop saying things you\r\n          don't mean. I protected you.\r\n          From that whore Tracy and that\r\n          nasty little kitten... and That\r\n          scumbag of a professor...\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Even that loser ex-boyfriend of\r\n          yours.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          What're you talking about? What'd\r\n          you do to them? What'd you do to\r\n          Jason?\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I got rid of them all. And how do\r\n          you repay me? By leaving me.\r\n          Sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment.\r\n          She looks at Irene.\r\n          Sara digs deep... lifts up her face... and looks Rebecca in\r\n          the eye. She puts everything she has into this.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca, please forgive me.\r\n          A long beat. Rebecca's face lights up.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Now we can start all over again.\r\n          Let's make things the way they\r\n          were, Sara. That first day. Just\r\n          the two of us.\r\n          Sara sees Rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca...\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          After all... you can only have one\r\n          best friend.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          No! Don't!\r\n          Rebecca whips the bag around Irene's head. Irene starts to\r\n          buck and thrash. But it doesn't help her...\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Lay still bitch.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Please. Don't do this...\r\n          Sara stands. She stares at Irene. She can't watch her die.\r\n          She walks toward the bed, ignoring Rebecca's gun.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Stop! I mean it.\r\n          Rebecca raises the gun to Sara's face but Sara keeps coming.\r\n          Rebecca realizes she can't stop Sara. She cracks Sara across\r\n          the temple with the gun-butt, knocking her to the floor.\r\n          She kneels down beside Sara. Worried... clearing the hair\r\n          from Sara's face.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n\r\n                         (GENTLE)\r\n          Shh... I'm so sorry.\r\n          Sara backhands her, knocking the gun out of her hand. It\r\n          skitters across the floor and out the door into the living\r\n          room.\r\n          Sara stands up first and dives for the bed, but Rebecca grabs\r\n          Sara by the neck and rips her off the bed. She puts her in a\r\n          chokehold.\r\n          Sara backs Rebecca into the wall, trying to loosen the\r\n          chokehold. She slams her back against the wall. And again.\r\n          Sara smashes her elbow into Rebecca's jaw, breaking her grip.\r\n          She heads for the door, but Rebecca trips her. As Sara\r\n          rises...\r\n          Rebecca knees her in her stomach, knocking the wind out of\r\n          her. As Sara gasps for breath...\r\n          Rebecca races out into the living room for the gun.\r\n          Sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it.\r\n          Rebecca turns around and goes for the door.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          112.\r\n          Sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on Irene's\r\n          head.\r\n          IRENE'S EYES POP OPEN. Huge relief in Sara's face. But...\r\n          Rebecca bangs the door.\r\n\r\n          REBECCA (O.S.)\r\n          Don't do this Sara!\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara takes the scarf out of Irene's mouth and pulls against\r\n          the steel handcuffs. Useless.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Don't make me hurt you, Sara. I\r\n          just want to be your friend.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara and Irene are frantic.\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          My phone. My phone.\r\n          She nods her head and Sara sees the phone on the bed table.\r\n          She rushes for it. No good the wire is cut!\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Shit!\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          The window! There's a fire escape.\r\n          You can reach it.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM\r\n\r\n          Rebecca looks around for the gun. Throwing chairs and\r\n          furniture around. She finds it.\r\n          Picks the gun off the floor.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara races to the window and throws it open. There's just an\r\n          empty street below. She eyes the fire escape. A nearly\r\n          impossible leap away. But Sara's out of options.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          113.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge. Her foot\r\n          hits a flowerpot, which plummets ten stories... and smashes\r\n          to pieces in the alley. Sara shuts her eyes.\r\n\r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca, back at the bedroom door, raises the gun and fires.\r\n\r\n          BLAM!\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM\r\n\r\n          The door shatters, and the bullet continues straight ahead\r\n          and tears a pillow open, just beside Irene's head. Feathers\r\n          go flying. Irene screams.\r\n          Rebecca kicks the door open and steps in, gun in hand.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          I know you're scared, Sara. But I\r\n          promise, everything is gonna be\r\n          okay.\r\n          She stops short at the sight of...Sara on the ledge.\r\n          Rebecca turns and stares at Irene. Fresh panic rising in\r\n          Irene's eyes.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Sorry, Irene. But she's my friend,\r\n          not yours.\r\n          She raises the gun at the helpless Irene...\r\n          But out of nowhere STEPHEN, RUSHING UP FROM BEHIND, knocks\r\n          her arm. The gun fires wildly, one bullet...\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Exploding through the window, shattering it and startling\r\n          Sara, who loses her balance and slips off the ledge. She\r\n          grabs on by her fingertips, her face hitting the brick wall.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n\r\n                         (CRYING)\r\n          Ohgodohgodohgod.\r\n          The more she screams, the more she loses her grip.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          114.\r\n\r\n          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Rebecca fires another shot, hitting a giant bedroom mirror,\r\n          shattering it's reflection of Rebecca's struggle with\r\n          Stephen.\r\n          Rebecca slams her head into his lip, knocking him backward.\r\n          He keeps hold of her, and they hit the floor, the gun flying\r\n          out of Rebecca's hand.\r\n          Stephen gets on top. He lifts his arm high and balls his fist\r\n          before he puts it right in her face full throttle, knocking\r\n          her out cold.\r\n          He quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he\r\n          races for the window.\r\n\r\n          SARA (O.S.)\r\n\r\n                         (SCREAMING)\r\n          Stephen! Help!\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n          Hurry!!\r\n          He sees Sara dangling outside and reaches for her.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUILDING LEDGE - SAME\r\n\r\n          Sara's crying, barely mouthing Stephen's name. He grabs her\r\n          arms. Leaning halfway outside, he starts to pull her up.\r\n          Part of the way up, he holds her against his chest and lets\r\n          her cry. He smiles.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Okay I've got you. Everything is\r\n          gonna be okay!\r\n          He pulls her halfway in the window...\r\n          But a shadow rises behind him.\r\n\r\n                         IRENE\r\n\r\n          STEPHEN!!!!\r\n          A loud unpleasant sound. THUD! Irene screams.\r\n          Then Stephen stiffens, his body straightening in shock.\r\n          Something's wrong. And now Sara stares in horror as...\r\n          Blood runs down his face. He looks into Sara's eyes... and\r\n          lets go of her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          115.\r\n          She falls, but manages to hook onto the ledge as Stephen\r\n          disappears from the window frame. Using the brick wall for\r\n          leverage, she arduously lifts herself up into the window in\r\n          time to see...\r\n          Stephen, glassy-eyed, backing away from the window. He slumps\r\n          to the floor, revealing:\r\n          Rebecca. She's a crazed mess, hair and eyes wild.\r\n          Rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the\r\n          window. She helps Sara in. They tumble onto the floor.\r\n          Sara tosses Rebecca to the side and rushes over to Stephen.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Stephen.\r\n          Stephen is out. She sees the gun in his belt. She pulls it\r\n          out, spins, and levels it at Rebecca. The gun shakes\r\n          violently in her hand.\r\n          Rebecca stands and walks calmly towards Sara, who is still on\r\n          the floor.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          You won't do it. We're fr--\r\n          Sara pulls the trigger. Click. Rebecca stares in shock.\r\n          Click. Click. Click. Click. Sara closes her eyes in\r\n          frustration. She drops the gun.\r\n          Tears stream down Rebecca's face. She can't believe Sara\r\n          pulled that trigger. But as if flipping a switch...\r\n          Rebecca's sadness turns to rage. She balls her fists, her\r\n          knuckles white, and...\r\n          CHARGES at Sara full force, slamming her against the wall.\r\n          She tosses her like a ragdoll across the room, where...\r\n          Sara's head slams the nightstand, knocking the contents of\r\n          Rebecca's purse everywhere.\r\n          Rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes. It hurts her to hurt\r\n          Sara.\r\n\r\n                         REBECCA\r\n          Friends help each other. They take\r\n          care of each other.\r\n          Sara, dazed and weak, stares at Rebecca.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          116.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Rebecca. We were never friends.\r\n          That's the last straw. Rebecca comes hard, murder in her\r\n          eyes. She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from\r\n          the floor, and slams her against the wall.\r\n          She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns\r\n          red. Redder...\r\n          But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.\r\n          Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand. The\r\n          utility knife is in her other hand... stuck between Rebecca's\r\n          shoulder blades.\r\n          Rebecca falls to the floor, bringing Sara down with her. She\r\n          won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...\r\n          Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-\r\n          consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out\r\n          and grabs Sara's hand.\r\n          Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from\r\n          around Rebecca's neck.\r\n          Irene is trembling in the bed. Too shocked to say anything.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n\r\n                         (GROANING)\r\n          Sara.\r\n          She races over to him. He's barely alive.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Stephen. Hold on.\r\n          She finds her phone on the floor. She steps back to Stephen\r\n          and cradles his head in her lap as she dials 911.\r\n          He looks into her eyes and smiles.\r\n          She smiles through her tears, love in her eyes.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUILDING - DAY\r\n\r\n          It's a warm, spring day. Sara, melancholy but looking in\r\n          much better shape since the last time we saw her, stands in\r\n          front of her dorm, looking to restart her college career.\r\n          She plays with the silver chain once again around her neck.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          117.\r\n          She opens the front door and walks in. Students milling about\r\n          look at her. Know who she is. We see Kim and Tracy. They\r\n          don't say anything. Don't know what to say.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara opens the door. The simple room is identical to her\r\n          previous one. She hesitates at first but then walks in.\r\n          There is a box marked \"SARA\" filled with the things she left\r\n          behind in her old dorm. There's a knock on the open door.\r\n\r\n          STEPHEN (O.S.)\r\n          Welcome back.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Hey. How are you feeling?\r\n          Stephen enters the room.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Better now. You being here's gonna\r\n          help.\r\n          Sara smiles.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN (CONT'D)\r\n          How's moving in going?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Just got here.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Well let me give you some time to\r\n          get settled in.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Actually, I need you right here,\r\n          right now.\r\n          Stephen grins. He likes where this is headed.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          Okay.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM HALLWAY\r\n\r\n          Sara and Stephen push the twin bed into the hallway.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          118.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          This isn't exactly what I had in\r\n          mind.\r\n          Sara grins.\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Now I can get settled in.\r\n\r\n                         STEPHEN\r\n          I'll be back to pick you up for\r\n          dinner. You gonna be ready?\r\n\r\n                         SARA\r\n          Absolutely.\r\n          Stephen takes off down the hall. Sara follows him with her\r\n          eyes before she goes back into her room.\r\n\r\n          INT. DORM ROOM\r\n\r\n          Sara sits down on her bed. She watches the empty space where\r\n          the other bed used to be. She just stares at it. The camera\r\n          slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf\r\n          where unseen by Sara, there's a flyer hung with a picture of\r\n          Richard Prince's Nurse of Greenmeadow announcing an upcoming\r\n          gallery exhibition.\r\n\r\n          CUT TO BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nRoommate, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Sonny Mallhi\u00a0\u00a0Frank Baldwin\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:22.860010"}
