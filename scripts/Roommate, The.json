As if it's waiting\r\n          patiently for this year's kids.\r\n          A long beat. The room darkens for an instant. Just the sun,\r\n          right, dipping behind a cloud? Maybe.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

She's dressed casually, but still chic.\r\n          No parents.\r\n          She carries a backpack on one shoulder, a duffle bag on the\r\n          other, and a huge suitcase in her hand. And she's staring\r\n          through the building's window at...\r\n          Newly-minted COLLEGE STUDENTS milling about inside. Their\r\n          parents in tow, pride and sadness mingled in their faces.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT. DORM LOBBY - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Sara walks to the registration table.

She bumps\r\n          into other carts, but everyone just laughs it off.\r\n          Sara stops in front of Room 316.\r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

Heaven.\r\n          Sara steps in. She looks at the two empty beds. Big choice\r\n          here. She drops her stuff on the bed by the window.\r\n          She sits down on it. A beat. I'm really here.\r\n          First things first -- Sara takes a framed picture out of her\r\n          duffle bag and sets it on the dresser. It's a picture of a\r\n          YOUNG GIRL, maybe ten. She looks a little like Sara.\r\n          Sara hauls a white, Styrofoam DESIGN MANNEQUIN off the cart.\r\n          It's full of pin and chalk marks. She sets it by her bed.\r\n\r\n<b>                         SARA\r\n</b>          Told you we'd make it.\r\n          She steps back to the doorway. As she hauls her suitcase off\r\n          the cart... BOOM! Another cart slams into hers. A box tumbles\r\n          off the other cart.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GIRL\r\n</b>          Sorry! Bad driver.\r\n          Sara kneels to help the other girl -- cute, frizzy hair --\r\n          clean up the mess. A slew of clothes lie on the carpet. And\r\n          peeking out from under them... a bottle of vodka. The girl\r\n          smiles sheepishly.\r\n\r\n<b>                         GIRL\r\n</b>          In case of emergency.\r\n\r\n<b>                         (BEAT)\r\n</b>          I'm Tracy.\r\n\r\n<b>                         SARA\r\n</b>          Sara.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          3.\r\n</b>          Balancing boxes, they manage to shake hands.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

Music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm\r\n          windows.\r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY\r\n</b>\r\n          Sara's cell phone buzzes.

We're talking\r\n          extreme fire hazard... extreme moral hazard.\r\n          Sara moves through the crowd. Her clothes are low-wattage,\r\n          but stylish. She's drawn to the music coming from a large\r\n          room.\r\n          A HIGH-ENERGY COLLEGE BAND on stage. They're not very good,\r\n          but they don't care. Sara finds a spot along the wall and\r\n          watches them. In particular --\r\n          THE DRUMMER. A cute goof, spastically whaling away. He's\r\n          mouthing the lyrics, eyes closed. Really into it. Sara\r\n          chuckles at the sight, not taking her eyes off him. He\r\n          definitely stands out.\r\n          Suddenly, a hand grabs her shoulder. Tracy pulls herself in\r\n          with Kim close behind and they start dancing to the band.\r\n          Juice spilling over the brim of her cup.

She grabs Sara around the throat, pulls her up from\r\n          the floor, and slams her against the wall.\r\n          She starts choking the life out of her. Sara's face turns\r\n          red. Redder...\r\n          But suddenly Rebecca's grip loosens. Her eyes stare in shock.\r\n          Sara pulls Rebecca's hands off her neck with one hand.

She\r\n          won't let go of Sara. As she gasps for air, she sees...\r\n          Sara's tattoo, visible beneath her torn shirt. Sara self-\r\n          consciously notices her looking at it. Rebecca reaches out\r\n          and grabs Sara's hand.\r\n          Sara lets go of her hand, and removes the necklace from\r\n          around Rebecca's neck.\r\n          Irene is trembling in the bed.
