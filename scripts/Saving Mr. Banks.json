And, of course, the ubiquitous\r\n          stuffed Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PAMELA\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          (TO MICKEY)\r\n</b>           I thought I left you in London.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up\r\n          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person\r\n          in America.\r\n\r\n<b>                          RALPH\r\n</b>           Had a feeling a certain friend of\r\n           mine might be needing me tonight.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PAMELA\r\n</b>           Ralph!\r\n          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.\r\n\r\n<b>                          RALPH\r\n</b>           You look like a million bucks!\r\n           Let's get you to the ball.\r\n          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs\r\n          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red\r\n          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters\r\n          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their\r\n          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens\r\n          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream\r\n          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and\r\n          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces\r\n          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing\r\n          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is\r\n          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest\r\n          party you could ever go to.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT.

Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with\r\n          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

It's too much.\r\n\r\n<b>                          RALPH\r\n</b>           (in her ear)\r\n           This is your night. None of this\r\n           would be possible without you.\r\n          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks\r\n          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic\r\n          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: \"Who is\r\n          that?\" \"Is that anyone?\" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and\r\n          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.\r\n          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and\r\n          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved\r\n          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy\r\n          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds\r\n          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT.

GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of\r\n          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the\r\n          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin\r\n          to dim. The overture begins--\r\n          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade\r\n          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers\r\n          old melody's rings in her ears.\r\n          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain\r\n          with Pamela.\r\n          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,\r\n          humming, sad, happy, joyous.\r\n          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices\r\n          of Bert and Jane -\r\n          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--\r\n\r\n<b>                          BERT\r\n</b>           You know, begging your pardon, but\r\n           the one my heart goes out to is\r\n           your father.\r\n          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--\r\n\r\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           There he is in that cold, heartless\r\n           bank day after day, hemmed in by\r\n           mounds of cold, heartless\r\n           money.\r\n          The tuppence and rolling pears--\r\n\r\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           I don't like to see any living\r\n           thing caged up.\r\n          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river\r\n          soaked mother back to the house--\r\n\r\n<b>                          JANE\r\n</b>           Father in a cage?\r\n          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--\r\n\r\n<b>                          BERT\r\n</b>           They makes cages in all sizes and\r\n           shapes, you know.\r\n          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--\r\n\r\n<b>                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets\r\n           and all.\r\n\r\n<b>                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n</b>          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.\r\n          Rapt.\r\n\r\n<b>                          MICHEAL\r\n</b>           You won't ever leave us will you?\r\n\r\n<b>                          JANE\r\n</b>           Whatever would we do without you?\r\n\r\n<b>                          MARY POPPINS\r\n</b>           I shall stay until the wind\r\n           changes.\r\n          And then an image from the film:\r\n          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined\r\n          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.\r\n          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.\r\n          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her\r\n          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud\r\n          but people are noticing, looking at her.\r\n          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She\r\n          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.\r\n\r\n<b>                          WALT\r\n</b>           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's\r\n           alright. Mr Banks is going to be\r\n           all right. I promise.\r\n          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's\r\n          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.\r\n\r\n<b>                          PAMELA\r\n</b>           No, no.

The audience around her are\r\n          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent\r\n          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to\r\n          mouth along with the lyrics.\r\n          And in her head one final image appears.\r\n          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,\r\n          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken\r\n          understanding of what is to come, before his close with\r\n          tiredness.\r\n\r\n<b>           TRAVERS (V.O.)\r\n</b>           Never.
