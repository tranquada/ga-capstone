BIGGER!\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           Good Lord.\r\n          Pamela drops her bags, grabs Mickey and places him on the\r\n          floor, facing the wall.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                          (TO MICKEY)\r\n           And you can stay there until you\r\n           learn the art of subtlety.\r\n          Pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. She takes\r\n          from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night\r\n          stand, followed by another bottle and another and another.\r\n          The potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make-up,\r\n          the bag is endless. Things, things and more things come\r\n          streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses\r\n          windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature\r\n          Buddhas. Finally she takes out an impossibly large framed\r\n          picture of herself. She holds it up, admires it, takes down\r\n          an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           There.\r\n          Pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in\r\n          front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. She turns\r\n          her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. She leans\r\n          forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly\r\n          unlined for a woman of her years. She smiles, full of vanity.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                          (SATISFIED)\r\n           Yes.\r\n           (answering an imaginary\r\n\r\n                          QUESTION)\r\n           Well, no, I don't suppose I do\r\n           mind.\r\n          She laughs, but Pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as\r\n          an ugly snort.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           Now, really! Flatterer!\r\n           (then scolding herself)\r\n           Silly girl.\r\n          She turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a\r\n          remote control staring at it with bemusement. She points it\r\n          at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the\r\n          TV bursts into life.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           Oh!\r\n          She clicks again, the TV goes off, again and it's on. A\r\n          housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is\r\n          the greatest thing ever invented.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           Soap for the brains.\r\n          She changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a\r\n          black and white screen. It takes a moment before she realizes\r\n          that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly\r\n          face of WALTER ELIAS DISNEY (58) on The Wonderful World of\r\n          Disney Show. Pamela raises an eyebrow--\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA (CONT'D)\r\n           Well, well-- There you are.\r\n\r\n          CU: TV SCREEN\r\n          Walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.\r\n\r\n                          WALT\r\n           Don't worry!

There, huddled together, whispering are her mother,\r\n          the doctor and Aunt Ellie.\r\n          Ellie is holding a pile of blood stained sheets.\r\n          Ginty stands frozen, trying to still the panicked beating of\r\n          her heart.\r\n          Margaret spies Ginty and moves towards her as if in slo-mo.\r\n          There are flecks of blood on her dress.

The front of her father's nightdress is also\r\n          bloodstained. Ginty's eyes reach his face.

I knew\r\n           you wouldn't have forgotten me.\r\n\r\n                          WALT\r\n           Pam, how could I?\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA\r\n           How indeed? You did, after all,\r\n           assure me that I wouldn't be\r\n           disappointed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. SUITE - BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY\r\n\r\n          The porter lets Pamela into her room, and doesn't even bother\r\n          hovering for a tip.\r\n          Pamela turns and it's like deju vu - the flowers, the\r\n          chocolates, the champagne, a VIP invitation to the premiere\r\n          of Walt Disney's Mary Poppins. And, of course, the ubiquitous\r\n          stuffed Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA\r\n\r\n                          (TO MICKEY)\r\n           I thought I left you in London.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - FORECOURT - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Pamela looks wonderful in a long white gown with turquoise\r\n          silk gloves to her elbows and matching wrap falling from her\r\n          shoulders.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA\r\n\r\n                          (TO DOORMAN)\r\n           Would you call me a taxi please?\r\n\r\n                          DOORMAN\r\n           Absolutely.\r\n          The doorman goes to find her a cab and in his absence a limo\r\n          pulls up to the kerb. Pamela doesn't dare get her hopes up\r\n          but the door swings open and there he is, her favorite person\r\n          in America.\r\n\r\n                          RALPH\r\n           Had a feeling a certain friend of\r\n           mine might be needing me tonight.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA\r\n           Ralph!\r\n          She rushes to him and they give each other a friendly hug.\r\n\r\n                          RALPH\r\n           You look like a million bucks!\r\n           Let's get you to the ball.\r\n          He opens the back door for her and she climbs in.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          It's spectacular! Disney's biggest Hollywood opening. Bulbs\r\n          flash continuously as limo after limo pulls up at the red\r\n          carpet. Ushers are dressed as English bobbies. Reporters\r\n          stand on podiums in colourful suits, Penguins dance their\r\n          hearts out in front of the theater. Pearly Kings and Queens\r\n          play for the onlookers. Crowds and crowds of fans scream\r\n          every time a bulb flashes, waving their autograph books and\r\n          posters in the air. Every Disney character imaginable bounces\r\n          up and down the lines of well-wishers, hugging them, dancing\r\n          for them, signing their booklets. Hollywood Blvd is\r\n          completely shut down and the atmosphere is like the happiest\r\n          party you could ever go to.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. LIMO - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Ralph takes the car slowly through the crowds. Onlookers\r\n          press their faces against the windows trying to make out who\r\n          is inside. Pamela is nervous, everyone else has someone with\r\n          them but Pamela must brave the crowd alone.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER - HOLLYWOOD -NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The limo stops at the edge of the carpet and Ralph jumps out.\r\n          He rushes round to Pamela's side and helps her from the car.\r\n          Immediately a round of flashes go off and Pamela puts her arm\r\n          up to shield her eyes. It's too much.\r\n\r\n                          RALPH\r\n           (in her ear)\r\n           This is your night. None of this\r\n           would be possible without you.\r\n          She brings her arm down, straightens her dress and breaks\r\n          into a smile, making her way down the carpet to frantic\r\n          whispers amongst the press and autograph hunters of: \"Who is\r\n          that?\" \"Is that anyone?\" Pamela spots Walt, Dick Van Dyke and\r\n          Julie Andrews being interviewed together up ahead.\r\n          Mickey Mouse bounces down the carpet and slows-- he and\r\n          Pamela lock eyes for a brief moment. He holds out his gloved\r\n          hand, she takes it and together they watch as a huge toy\r\n          train chugs to a halt on the blvd and hundreds upon hundreds\r\n          of coloured balloons fly out of it's roof and into the air.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          Pamela moves through the spangling, glittering, perfect\r\n          toothed Hollywood crowd and no-one pays any attention to her.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The auditorium is jam packed. Pamela is seated in front of\r\n          Walt Disney. Don, the Shermans and their families are in the\r\n          same row as her - Bob Sherman next to her. The lights begin\r\n          to dim. The overture begins--\r\n          We stay close on Pamela as the sounds of the overture fade\r\n          and the melody of a single tin whistle playing one of Travers\r\n          old melody's rings in her ears.\r\n          We hear snippets of the film in the background but we remain\r\n          with Pamela.\r\n          She looks around at the faces in the audience - laughing,\r\n          humming, sad, happy, joyous.\r\n          Intercut with images from Pamela's childhood and the voices\r\n          of Bert and Jane -\r\n          Ellie's parrot head umbrella--\r\n\r\n                          BERT\r\n           You know, begging your pardon, but\r\n           the one my heart goes out to is\r\n           your father.\r\n          The carousel horses at the Allora fair--\r\n\r\n                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n           There he is in that cold, heartless\r\n           bank day after day, hemmed in by\r\n           mounds of cold, heartless\r\n           money.\r\n          The tuppence and rolling pears--\r\n\r\n                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n           I don't like to see any living\r\n           thing caged up.\r\n          Uncle Albert with Ginty on his back, carrying her river\r\n          soaked mother back to the house--\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           Father in a cage?\r\n          Ginty pressing the final bottle into her father's hand--\r\n\r\n                          BERT\r\n           They makes cages in all sizes and\r\n           shapes, you know.\r\n          The image of the dead Travers in his bloodstained bed--\r\n\r\n                          BERT (CONT'D)\r\n           Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets\r\n           and all.\r\n\r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n          Children in the audience, their little faces tilted upwards.\r\n          Rapt.\r\n\r\n                          MICHEAL\r\n           You won't ever leave us will you?\r\n\r\n                          JANE\r\n           Whatever would we do without you?\r\n\r\n                          MARY POPPINS\r\n           I shall stay until the wind\r\n           changes.\r\n          And then an image from the film:\r\n          George Banks walks away from us down the misty tree-lined\r\n          London street, on his way to be fired from the bank.\r\n          Walt Disney watches with quiet satisfaction.\r\n          Pamela however has tears coursing down her face. Her\r\n          shoulders heave as she tries desperately not to sob out loud\r\n          but people are noticing, looking at her.\r\n          Disney leans forward, placing a hand on her shoulder. She\r\n          reaches up and grips it tightly, unable to speak.\r\n\r\n                          WALT\r\n           It's all right, Mrs Travers. It's\r\n           alright. Mr Banks is going to be\r\n           all right. I promise.\r\n          Pamela nods in gratitude, but cannot contain her sobs. It's\r\n          all pouring from her now, in one immense catharsis.\r\n\r\n                          PAMELA\r\n           No, no. It's just that-- I can't, I\r\n           can't abide cartoons!\r\n          We stay on her face as we bring up the final song of the\r\n          film: Let's Go Fly A Kite. The audience around her are\r\n          smiling, laughing, singing along. Pamela, the tears, silent\r\n          now, still pouring down her cheeks as she slowly begins to\r\n          mouth along with the lyrics.\r\n          And in her head one final image appears.\r\n          Travers gaze falls upon Ginty, outside his bedroom window,\r\n          sweeping. Their eyes meet for a brief moment, an unspoken\r\n          understanding of what is to come, before his close with\r\n          tiredness.\r\n\r\n           TRAVERS (V.O.)\r\n           Never. I promise. I will never lose\r\n           you.\r\n\r\n                          DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT. MARYBOROUGH PARK - DAY\r\n\r\n          The shadow of an umbrella leaves the ten-year-old Ginty\r\n          sitting in the lush grass, arms wrapped tightly around her\r\n          chest, face to the sky as a smile breaks free across her\r\n          face.\r\n\r\n           TRAVERS (V.O.)\r\n\r\n                          (SINGING)\r\n           Winds in the East\r\n           Mist coming in--\r\n          The shadow of an umbrella, floats higher and higher--\r\n\r\n                          TRAVERS\r\n           --Like something is brewing,\r\n           about to begin--\r\n          And further and further--\r\n\r\n                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)\r\n           Can't put me finger on what lies in\r\n\r\n                          STORE--\r\n          We give chase but cannot catch up--\r\n\r\n                          TRAVERS (CONT'D)\r\n           But I feel what's to happen, all\r\n\r\n                          HAPPENED BEFORE--\r\n          And the umbrella floats up, up, up into the atmosphere and\r\n\r\n                         AWAY--\r\n\r\n                          FADE OUT:\r\n\r\n                         END\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nSaving Mr. Banks\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kelly Marcel\u00a0\u00a0Sue Smith\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0 Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:34:34.996660"}
