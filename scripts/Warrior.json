Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching\r\n          skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts\r\n          raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face\r\n          and body.\r\n                         \r\n          It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,\r\n          mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture\r\n          of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.\r\n                         \r\n          A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his\r\n          head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs\r\n          out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          PROMOTER\r\n</b>           Nice fight.

Brendan stares at him.\r\n          Everything about him says \"Quit, Tommy.\" But Tommy won't.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT.

He batters the\r\n          defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,\r\n          blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince\r\n          in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.\r\n                         \r\n          Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him\r\n          to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the\r\n          face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes\r\n          pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls\r\n          Brendan away.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          JOSH ROSENTHAL\r\n</b>           Break!

The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are\r\n          glazed over.
