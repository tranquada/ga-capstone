Pushing\r\n          him towards the door.

Cougar looks\r\n          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the\r\n          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:\r\n                         \r\n          They've lost.\r\n                         \r\n                          CLAY\r\n           (answering the question)\r\n           Roque.\r\n                         \r\n          Cougar lowers his head, sadly.

Knowing, this is the\r\n          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.\r\n                         \r\n                          LEAD GUARD\r\n           On your knees.\r\n                         \r\n          Pooch SPITS AT HIM.

The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and\r\n          Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch\r\n          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:\r\n                         \r\n                          POOCH\r\n           Get on with it...\r\n           105.\r\n                         \r\n          The Lead Guard smiles.

He reaches for Cougar\r\n          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their\r\n          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.\r\n                         \r\n          The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.\r\n          Levelling the rifle at his head...\r\n                         \r\n           LEAD GUARD (CONT'D)\r\n           Don't really care of there's a\r\n           hole in it.

The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly\r\n          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.\r\n          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.\r\n                         \r\n                          MAX (CONT'D)\r\n           You gentlemen consider yourselves\r\n           to be soldiers or businessmen?\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n           118.\r\n                         \r\n                         BLACK SCREEN\r\n                         \r\n          We think it's the end. But then we hear\r\n                         \r\n          WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound\r\n          of evening television. Somewhere suburban...\r\n                         \r\n          FADE IN ON:\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

She obviously\r\n          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.\r\n          Opens it and looks out to see...\r\n                         \r\n          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.\r\n                         \r\n          She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies\r\n                         \r\n          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She\r\n          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.\r\n          Her breath hitches in her chest.\r\n                         \r\n          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.\r\n                         \r\n          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she\r\n          knows what it means.\r\n                         \r\n          Her husband is alive.
