HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1\n    It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY\n    BENNETT sings \"Rags to Riches\" on the SOUNDTRACK.\n    Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a\n    highway.\n    The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors\n    up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-\n    per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and\n    cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.\n\n\n2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2\n    Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her\n    son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,\n    she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works\n    at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a\n    fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and\n    energetic and lively. Even more important than these\n    qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of\n    all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is\n    effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes\n    and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.\n    The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won-\n    derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of\n    adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self-\n    assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old\n    kid.\n    Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored\n    and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with\n    Caroline, who is ignoring him.\n                              TOBY\n               ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious\n               -- I do.   You promise and promise,\n               and then  you change your mind,\n               just like  that.\n                             CAROLINE\n                      (totally oblivious)\n               ... Uh-huh.\n                             TOBY\n               You wait 'til you ask me for\n               something. Just wait. See if you\n               get it.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            2.\n2   CONTINUED:                                              2\n                            CAROLINE\n                     (as above)\n              Toby, hush. Let me just...\n    So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish\n    her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car\n    crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with\n    relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.\n                            CAROLINE\n              What'd you say?\n                            TOBY\n              I said -- for the twentieth time\n              -- if a person promises somebody\n              something, they can't just turn\n              around and take it back.\n                            CAROLINE\n              Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start\n              with that again.\n                             TOBY\n              Why not?\n                            CAROLINE\n              Because I'm the mother, and I\n              get to tell you what to do every\n              minute of your life 'til you're\n              eighteen. Seriously, we've got no\n              money. I can't buy you the\n              moccasins.\n                            TOBY\n              I bet if you'd promised Roy some\n              moccasins he'd of got 'em.\n\n                            CAROLINE\n              No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto\n              the moccasins. We, can't, afford,\n              them.\n                            TOBY\n              Yeah, but you did promise...\n                            CAROLINE\n              Sue me. Take me to court. Oh,\n              Toby, I know you're disappointed,\n              but...\n                             TOBY\n              Jack.   Call me Jack.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           3.\n2   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            2\n                            CAROLINE\n              You're going to drive me to an\n              early grave: I'm never going to\n              make Salt Lake City.\n                            TOBY\n              Seriously. If a person can't get\n              a stinking miserable pair of\n              moccasins, at least he ought to be\n              able to choose his own name...\n                     (loud)\n              ... and I wanna be called Jack!\n                            CAROLINE\n              Fine.  And you can call me...\n                     (she thinks)\n              ... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.\n                            TOBY\n              Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,\n              I...\n    The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them\n    look through the back window and see a huge tractor-\n    trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.\n    Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the\n    NASH safely onto the side of the road.\n    The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and\n    slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the\n    next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into\n    empty space, its HORN still BLARING.\n    Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out\n    of the car.\n\n\n3   EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3\n    Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet\n    below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.\n    Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby\n    away, one arm around his shoulder.\n\n4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4\n    Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of\n    water.\n                             CAROLINE\n                     (not much heat)\n              Goddamn thing.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                        4.\n4   CONTINUED:                                          4\n    She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare\n    avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.\n                            CAROLINE\n              Oh, that poor man.\n    There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks:\n                            TOBY\n              I hope to hell this isn't some\n              kind of omen.\n    Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees\n    the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins\n    and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.\n\n\n5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5\n    Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair\n    of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing \"Mood Indigo\"\n    together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con-\n    traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.\n                            TOBY\n              How's this thing work, anyway?\n                            CAROLINE\n                     (not confident)\n              It makes a black light that, uh,\n              causes uranium traces to glow.\n                            TOBY\n              And we just walk along the street\n              and find this glowing uranium?\n\n                            CAROLINE\n              Well, it was everywhere in Moab,\n              they say -- just like gold in the\n              gold-rush days.\n                            TOBY\n              But we were too late in Moab, and\n              that guy at the office said\n              nobody'd found any uranium in Salt\n              Lake City.\n                            CAROLINE\n              Well, that means we'll have the\n              place pretty much to ourselves,\n              huh? Honey, this could be a big\n              break for us. If this works out,\n              oh, just think: we'll get us a\n              house, get rid of this damn Nash\n              Ambassador -- no money worries...\n              It'll be like heaven on a June day.\n\n                                                        5.\n6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6\n    We hear \"MOOD INDIGO\" on the car RADIO and see that a\n    weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is\n    slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then\n    opens his eyes.\n                            CAROLINE\n              Ask me how far we are from Salt\n              Lake City.\n    Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a\n    small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.\n                            CAROLINE/TOBY\n              Forty-seven miles to go!\n\n    Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps\n    his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --\n\n7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7\n    Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the\n    road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and\n    Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.\n                            CAROLINE\n              If I could have one wish right\n              now -- only one wish -- you know\n              what I'd like? I'd like to burn\n              this damn Nash Ambassador to a\n              crisp.\n                     (as Toby laughs)\n              I'm serious. I hate it. I hate\n              the factory that produced it, and\n              I hate the man who invented it.\n\n                            TOBY\n              It almost makes me want to see Roy\n              -- he was the only one could make\n              the thing stop overheating.\n                     (a beat)\n              My God, he was boring. Boring and\n              mean: you sure got crappy taste in\n              boyfriends.\n    At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches\n    the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk\n    about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and\n    speaks directly to the car.\n                            CAROLINE\n              I'd like to burn you to the ground.\n                     (to Toby; big smile)\n              Let's go get rich in Salt Lake\n              City!\n\n                                                         6.\n8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY                       8\n     Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a\n     three-story concrete building. He holds a portable\n     RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing \"Volare.\"\n\n9    INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME                              9\n     Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands\n     across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her\n     very strangely.\n                             MAN\n               You're pulling my leg, right?\n                             CAROLINE\n               No, I came here to look for\n               uranium.\n                             MAN\n               My God, lady. If you're looking\n               for uranium, why didn't you go to\n               Moab?\n                             CAROLINE\n               We went there, but everybody'd\n               beaten us there. We were too late.\n                             MAN\n               So you came here just on the\n               chance you'd find uranium?\n               Listen, you mind me saying\n               something to you might sound rude?\n               Lady, you got more courage than\n               you got common sense.\n\n\n10   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 10\n     Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in\n     a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and\n     says two words:\n                             CAROLINE\n               Don't ask.\n\n11   INT.

Don't tell me what I\n               already know. This thing's a\n               bottomless pit. I don't know what\n               to do. No matter how much money I\n               pour into it...\n     Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive\n     sweater stops.

CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)                   13\n     1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread\n     is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed;\n     people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children\n     carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and\n     Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they\n     were going.\n                             CAROLINE\n               ... find ourselves a cheap room\n               someplace, we'll get you into\n               school, I'll brush up on my typing\n               and get a job, and things'll start\n               looking up. I feel it: the good\n               times are coming. And at least\n               we're rid of that damn Nash\n               Ambassador!\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              9.\n13   CONTINUED:                                                    13\n                             TOBY\n               Yeah, and like Dad used to say,\n               'We may be broke, but we're never\n               poor.' And later, if we get a\n               house with a big yard, I could\n               get a collie, you know? One like\n               Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday\n               maybe a palomino. And I'm going\n               to try harder in school, too...\n     The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an\n     odd way, brave as hell.\n\n14   INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                            14\n\n     A subdued Toby sits in front of the VICE PRINCIPAL.\n                             VICE PRINCIPAL\n               ... like to give new boys the\n               benefit of the doubt, but this\n               is the second time in two weeks\n               that you've been in front of me,\n               and I don't like that.\n                      (picks up a telephone)\n               Now I think you better just call\n               your mother and tell her to come\n               down here.\n                              TOBY\n               She works.

CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                     16\n\n      The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy\n      beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall.\n      Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy\n      bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:\n                              CAROLINE\n                My head is killing me.\n      Toby heads for his room.\n\n16A   SAME SCENE - DUSK                                       16A\n      Caroline wakes up with a start, then sees Toby sitting\n      in a chair, watching her.\n                              CAROLINE\n                What time is it?\n                                TOBY\n                Seven.    Almost.\n                              CAROLINE\n                Why didn't you wake me?\n                              TOBY\n                I started dinner. The potatoes\n                are frying, and I'm heating up the\n                hot dogs.\n      Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and\n      pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves\n      to sit beside her.\n                              CAROLINE\n                Hold your mother's hand.\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            11.\n16A   CONTINUED:                                            16A\n                                TOBY\n                I'm sorry.\n                              CAROLINE\n                I know you are, honey. Ah, well\n                -- it wasn't fire, and nobody\n                bled, so I guess we're okay.\n      The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.   When she hears\n      the VOICE on the other end she once again  touches her\n      right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the\n      bruise had been. She sags back against a   wall.\n                                CAROLINE\n                Yes...\n                         (listens)\n                Yes...\n                       (listens)\n                Yes, I know...\n                       (listens)\n                You're right...\n                       (listens)\n                All right, yes... in an hour,\n                then.\n      Caroline hangs up.\n                                TOBY\n                Who was that?\n      She closes her eyes.\n                                TOBY\n                Who was that?\n      Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until\n      she's on the floor still laughing.\n                              CAROLINE\n                We've got a guest for dinner:\n                it's Roy. He tracked us down.\n      Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa.\n\n17    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER           17\n      Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy\n      is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way.\n      Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is\n      a mean streak in him.\n      Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his\n      lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              12.\n17   CONTINUED:                                               17\n                              ROY\n               ... I found me a room, but it's\n               clear the hell and gone 'cross\n               town. And I think I got a job\n               lined up doin' tune-ups in a\n               Texaco station. How you like it\n               at Winstead's?\n                             CAROLINE\n               How do you know where I work?\n                             ROY\n               I been here almost a week.\n                             CAROLINE\n               You followed me around?    For a\n               week? Watching?\n     Roy doesn't answer.   He just wiggles his eyebrows like\n     Groucho Marx.\n                             CAROLINE\n               And how did you ever find me?\n     Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.    He turns to Toby.\n                             ROY\n               You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,'\n               I mean.\n                             TOBY\n               It's the best present I ever got.\n               I just love it.\n                      (to Caroline)\n               I'm going to pretend I'm shooting.\n\n                             CAROLINE\n               Don't point that thing at anybody\n               or I won't teach you to shoot.\n                             TOBY\n               It's not loaded!\n                               CAROLINE\n               You heard me:    anybody or any\n               thing.\n                             TOBY\n               It's got no bullets, for God's\n               sake.\n                             CAROLINE\n               Don't make me speak to you again.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            13.\n17   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             17\n                             TOBY\n               I'll point it at the sky, then.\n     Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and\n     points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire\n     it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table.\n     Roy jumps up to help her.\n\n18   INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER                           18\n     Caroline and Roy are   kissing on the sofa, and he is all\n     over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs,\n     everywhere. Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls\n     away, indicating the   light in the other room.\n\n                              CAROLINE\n               Don't.   Toby's still up.\n     Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline.\n                             ROY\n               You are one sweet thing, baby:\n               just the sight of you makes my\n               dick hard.\n     He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him\n     off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light\n     burns.\n                             ROY\n               Aw, he won't hear anything.\n     Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head\n     from the kiss.\n\n     Then it happens.\n     A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves\n     Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing\n     that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before\n     between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is\n     immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic.\n                             ROY\n               Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't\n               mean that. I'm just so glad to\n               see you.\n     He slides toward Caroline, kisses her. This time she\n     accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice.\n\n                                                             14.\n19   INT. KITCHEN - PARALLEL TIME                                  19\n     Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can\n     hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize\n     between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby\n     streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes\n     his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips,\n     pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the\n     steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow\n     a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE\n     again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig-\n     arette. He looks very young.\n\n20   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           20\n     Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch\n     TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden.

A few\n      months have passed.  He now wears T-shirts and jeans\n      which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he\n      combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward\n      into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip\n      -- or thinks he is.  He strolls on, feeling cool.\n\n24A   EXT. TRACT HOUSE/FURTHER DOWN STREET - AFTERNOON          24A\n      From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into\n      step with Toby.

TV ROOM - AFTERNOON                                27\n     The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so\n     the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the\n     floor in front of a black-and-white TV.\n     Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor\n     starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps\n     to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also\n     moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual\n     transport.\n                             TOBY\n               Oh, Lois.

Then,\n      slowly, they shut up and lie back down.\n\n27A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                           27A\n      And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent,\n      all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are\n      totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth\n      of the show.\n      Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast;\n      all three are at least two years from their first shave;\n      all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all\n      bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three\n      skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman.\n\n28    INT.

Toby doesn't know for sure.\n     Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.     He is older\n     than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built,\n     has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth.\n     Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his over-\n     eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes.\n     He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a\n     monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in\n     the pocket.\n     Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.

The contestants have ten\n     turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye\n     fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a\n     portable scoreboard.\n     A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause.\n     Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the\n     concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs.\n     The score comes:     84.\n     There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's\n     turn.\n     From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good\n     shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going\n     to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID\n     SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then\n     his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate\n     smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline.\n\n     There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her\n     position, and someone in the crowd yells out, \"Oh, Mama,\n     shake that thang!\" Caroline ignores it, taking her\n     shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and\n     professional-looking.\n     She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once,\n     deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is\n     raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and\n     then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of\n     applause.\n\n     SAME SCENE - LATER\n     Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally\n     surprised.\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             32.\n38   CONTINUED:                                                    38\n     On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second\n     place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last round\n     finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are\n     complimenting her shooting. Dwight's smile is even\n     bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win.\n     The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first\n     place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he\n     passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks\n     confidently.\n                             MAN\n               That second-place trophy ain't\n               bad, honey.\n\n                             CAROLINE\n                      (big smile)\n               Then you won't feel too bad about\n               carrying it home, will you?\n     Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away.\n     Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is\n     evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he\n     SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is\n     an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a\n     virtually perfect round.\n     Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but\n     clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right-\n     handed, then with both eyes closed.\n     His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter,\n     and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his\n     attitude says.\n     Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her\n     TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won.\n     The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone\n     else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official\n     presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a\n     pedestal, and a huge ham.\n     In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close\n     enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances\n     toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby:\n                             CAROLINE\n               That was for you, honey.\n                             TOBY\n                      (impressed)\n               I didn't know you were a member of\n               the N.R.A.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             33.\n38   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              38\n                             CAROLINE\n               I'm a little behind in my dues --\n               Thirty-six years behind.\n\n39   INT.

Oh, I see -- you hit the\n               turkey more than once. While he\n               was flying. In the head.\n\n     Toby nods. Silver     and Taylor howl with laughter.\n     Furious, Toby says    \"Fuck you\" over and over. He pulls\n     out a rat-tail and    scratches the words \"FUCK YOU\" onto\n     the soft paint of    the bathroom wall.\n\n43   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           43\n     Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver\n     and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too\n     innocent: something's up.\n     They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns\n     and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them\n     open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and\n     start it rolling down the hill.\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            36.\n43   CONTINUED:                                             43\n     The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into\n     another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE.\n     The three boys run like the wind out of sight.\n\n44   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                     44\n     Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating\n     dinner.\n                             KATHY\n               ... exactly what I wanted for my\n               dress. It's a Simplicity pattern,\n               and I'm pretty sure I can make it\n               myself. It's got big puff\n               sleeves...\n     Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps\n     as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over\n     backwards.\n                             TOBY\n               Oh!\n     Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate\n     Dwight: saying, \"Oh!\" and \"Oh, yes!\" and Oh, my!\"\n     and \"Here, let me!\" and \"I'll do that!\"\n     It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three\n     women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps\n     saying \"Jack, that's enough,\" and Marian says, \"Dwight's\n     not that bad.\" But they can't help laughing. Toby\n     offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom,\n     the back door, and the refrigerator a light.\n\n\n45   INT.

I went downstairs\n               and started to rummage through the\n               garbage cans. But as I reached\n               down -- I mean, right down into a\n               garbage can -- I suddenly thought,\n               'Whoa. Hold on right there,\n               Buster.' I went back to my room\n               and to this day I haven't smoked\n               another cigarette.\n                              (MORE)\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               38.\n45    CONTINUED:   (2)                                               45\n                              MR.

Dwight took us\n               all to see Bridge on the River\n               Kwai. I liked it. So things are\n               all right with me, except for\n               stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don't\n               worry all the time...\n55   E)   (NIGHT) Dwight introduces Toby at a Scout              55\n          meeting. All the other boys have on Scout\n          uniforms.\n55   F)   (DAY) Toby is on the utility porch  husking the 55\n          horse chestnuts. His hands are now  orange. Pearl\n          stands in the doorway watching him work. Norma\n          appears beside Pearl. Norma's face  turns\n          sympathetic.\n                             NORMA\n               You remind me of that boy in the\n               fairy tale who had to spend twenty\n               years sifting sand to find a\n               golden needle. Remember that one?\n          Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away.    Toby\n          sighs, and picks up another chestnut.\n55   G)   (DAY) Toby, keeping an eye on the door to make 55\n          sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress\n          of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized\n          black and white pornographic photographs. The hair\n          styles of the women in them are decades old.\n          Toby takes the photographs into the bathroom,\n          shutting the door behind him.\n                             CAROLINE (V.O.)\n               Dear Toby, Just a note before\n               going to bed. Dwight tells me\n               that the two of you are getting\n               along like a house afire. I'm\n               so glad. I wanted this to work\n               out for you.

Across the 55\n          room, Toby lies with his portable RADIO against his\n          head. We hear, very, very softly, ROSEMARY CLOONEY\n          crooning \"Hey, There.\" He's tired.

Holding her foot up, he kisses    the\n     instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then\n     down under the arch of her foot.

Toby gives\n     Norma's rear-end    an appreciative glance, then comes up\n     behind Caroline,    speaking sotto voce:\n                             TOBY\n               So how's the bride?\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             62.\n70   CONTINUED:                                              70\n                               CAROLINE\n               Don't.\n                             TOBY\n               The bride doesn't want to chat?\n                               CAROLINE\n               Stop it.\n                             TOBY\n               Well, the bride is sure snotty\n               this morning.\n     Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing,\n     but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table.\n\n\n71   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                     71\n     Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands\n     talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and\n     JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, \"Uh-oh,\" and jerks his\n     head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should\n     look.\n     They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur\n     Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a\n     small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch\n     Arthur's approach:\n                             TOBY\n               What's his name again?\n                               OSCAR\n               Arthur Gayle.\n\n                               JIMMY\n               What a homo.\n                             TOBY\n               He sure walks like a girl.\n                             JIMMY\n               And runs like one and talks like\n               one and throws like one. Probably\n               takes a pee like one too -- just\n               squats right down.\n                             TOBY\n               He smarted off to me the other\n               day -- told me I was a bourgeois.\n                             JIMMY\n               What the frig's a bourgeois?\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                         63.\n71   CONTINUED:                                          71\n                             OSCAR\n                      (to Toby)\n               Call him a sissy.\n                              TOBY\n               Why?\n                             OSCAR\n               Just see what he says.\n                              JIMMY\n               Yeah, do it.\n     By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior\n     smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if\n     they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then\n     his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands.\n                             ARTHUR\n               Oh, my, my -- look at all that\n               yellow: Didn't your mama teach you\n               to wash your hands after you pee?\n                              TOBY\n               Oh, shut up.\n                             ARTHUR\n                      (rolls his eyes;\n                       heavily sarcastic)\n               Now that's what I like -- an\n               insult with some originality.\n               Did you just make that up? Just\n               now? So clever.\n                             TOBY\n               Why don't you take a long walk\n               off a short pier?\n                             ARTHUR\n                      (though he's not\n                       nearly close enough\n                       to smell Toby's\n                       breath)\n               Excuse me, but has anyone ever told\n               you your breath would gag a maggot?\n     Both of Toby's friends laugh.\n                             TOBY\n               Well, at least I'm not a great\n               big sissy!\n     Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes\n     from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single\n     expectant look: \"Here it comes.\"\n                                                (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                            64.\n71   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             71\n     Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching\n     him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the\n     back of the head.\n     The fight is on.\n     Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action,\n     but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react,\n     Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker\n     that puts Toby   on his knees.\n     While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick\n     him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers\n     in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he\n     has lost his mind:\n\n                             ARTHUR\n               GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A\n               BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL\n               STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL\n               YOU!\n     Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild\n     roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to\n     Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his\n     heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded\n     buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and\n     begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,\n     still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes\n     with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the\n     two stagger around the street like drunken dancers.\n     They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with\n     each other again.\n     Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two\n     roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment.\n     They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting,\n     flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur,\n     then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each\n     breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives\n     out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him\n     deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby\n     throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER\n     BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.\n     Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully.\n     He looks relieved -- at least it's over.\n     No, it's not.\n     From behind him he hears three words.\n                               ARTHUR\n               Take it back.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               65.\n71   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                71\n     Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur\n     clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster\n     that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand\n     facing one   another.\n                                 ARTHUR\n                Take it back.\n     Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out\n     too...\n                                 TOBY\n                Okay.\n                                 ARTHUR\n                Say it.\n                               TOBY\n                Okay.   I take it back.\n                              ARTHUR\n                No, say 'You're not a sissy.'\n     Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful\n     but he doesn't care what the hell they think.\n                              TOBY\n                You're not a sissy.\n     Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores\n     them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering\n     his hated newspapers.\n\n72   INT.

Dwight,\n     Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an\n     Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a\n     corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's\n     playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.\n\n     Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes\n     the saxophone to squawk.\n     The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne\n     Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip\n     of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet,\n     and begins to dance with her.\n     A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances\n     Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the\n     kitchen, around the table, and then back again.\n     Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every\n     step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight\n     kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The\n     kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             75.\n83   CONTINUED:                                              83\n     Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table\n     and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's\n     head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure.\n     As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline\n     back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back\n     where she was seated exactly on the last note of the\n     song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline\n     smiles at Toby.\n                             CAROLINE\n                      (breathy)\n               Try to find the good stuff, honey.\n\n\n84   INT.

Then she nods her\n     head.\n                               CAROLINE\n               All right.    Okay, Dwight. You\n               stay here.    Don't come inside.\n     Toby nods.

Dwight is     fixing himself another drink. Caroline\n     enters, puts down    the groceries, and goes to the dish\n     cabinet.

He grins and, with the palm\n     of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She\n     returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the\n     steps, staring into the twilight.\n\n\n97   INT. ARTHUR GAYLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                      97\n     Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song\n     called \"I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie.\" Both of\n     them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur\n     says a dry \"Will you be able to use your musical\n     abilities at the A&P?\" Toby laughs and gives him a hard\n     elbow in the ribs.\n\n98   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - NIGHT                            98\n     Toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he\n     hears:\n                                DWIGHT (O.S.)\n               Heh Hotshot!\n     He looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through\n     the air toward him.

DWIGHT'S ATTIC                                           99\n      Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both\n      shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating\n      old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, \"I know I put\n      'em up here somewhere.\" Then Toby's flashlight lands\n      on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had\n      held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver\n      has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of\n      what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,\n      the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.\n      Then Dwight says, \"Shit -- the roof must've leaked on\n      'em.\" Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight\n      on the ten boxes of chestnuts.\n      Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold,\n      too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking\n      stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a\n      breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he\n      turns and bangs out of the attic.\n\n100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)        100\n      A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the\n      other, Dwight is watching the NEWS.\n      On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and\n      her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is\n      led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then\n      a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear:\n                              NEWSCASTER (V.O.)\n                ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana\n                Turner, was held for questioning\n                today in the stabbing death of\n                Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's\n                companion. A spokesman for Miss\n                Turner said today that the\n                stabbing was an accident, and that\n                Miss Turner's daughter will not\n                spend even one night in jail for\n                what the spokesman called a\n                'tragic accident.'\n      Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight\n      turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway,\n      also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching\n      the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at\n      Dwight.\n      Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the\n      Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back\n      to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The\n      SOUND on the TV FADES.\n\n                                                           89.\n101   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                     101\n      A WHISTLE FADES UP.\n      Toby's basketball game against the Van Horn team is\n      starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby wears\n      his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,\n      and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.\n      The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished\n      floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is\n      silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these\n      strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,\n      and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,\n      and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes\n      SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip\n      him up or cause another boy to stumble.\n\n      Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the\n      gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,\n      like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation\n      comedy.\n      Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.\n      Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while\n      his expression is hard as stone: he will get through\n      this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase\n      over and over: \"gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get\n      out, gotta get out.\" Finally he makes a basket. One\n      VOICE from the audience YELLS out \"Okay, kid -- way\n      to go!\" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants\n      later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.\n      The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS\n      heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's\n      expression never changes.\n\n\n102   INT. DWIGHT'S GARAGE - SAME NIGHT (VERY LATE)              102\n      The Buick, rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a\n      straining but cautious Toby. Champ runs into the street,\n      Toby tries to shoo him away. The DOG BARKS ONCE, and\n      Toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in, STARTING\n      the ENGINE.\n\n103   INT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                              103\n      Toby drives fast leaving Concrete behind. He turns the\n      RADIO ON, and a VOICE bawls out \"Oh, Maybelline,\" Toby\n      turns the VOLUME UP, turns it UP AGAIN, so that the MUSIC\n      is DISTORTED. Toby begins to accelerate. The needle\n      creeps past ninety, and hovers close to one hundred.\n                                                 (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             90.\n103    CONTINUED:                                            103\n       Trees flash past in the headlights, occasional cars are\n       overtaken and passed in an instant. Toby starts laughing\n       hysterically and sings loudly along with the THROBBING\n       MUSIC.\n       The Buick begins to shudder and wobble -- Toby hits the\n       brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the\n       ditch. SILENCE.\n\n104    EXT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                                     104\n       The car is caught so that two of the wheels are off the\n       ground, and can get no purchase.

He\n       slams his forearm across Dwight's throat.\n       Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off\n       the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight\n       grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face\n       down against the mattress.\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                92.\n107A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              107A\n       Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back\n       of Toby's neck.

Toby then\n       turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then\n       Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car\n       disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.\n                                                    FADE OUT.\n       FADE UP TO:\n108A   SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON                                         108A\n       The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT.\n       The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted\n       saplings established in the previous scene are both eight\n       feet taller, with wide spreading branches.\n       Students pour out    the door.

CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of\n       Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second\n       boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency\n       toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy-\n       lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than\n       Toby's.

Suddenly a two-inch-\n      thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks\n      up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to\n      see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the\n      envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript\n      forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes\n      his eyes.

Toby pats   the manilla\n      envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks,\n      looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left\n      hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished\n      \"Hey,\" and sinks    to his knees.\n\n\n132   INT.

GLASS SHATTERS, the\n      kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and\n      SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has\n      only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's\n      eyes that bangs the man back against the wall.\n\n      Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs,\n      flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they\n      grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a\n      broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against\n      Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.\n      Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks\n      himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby\n      hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's\n      bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and\n      bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he\n      can.\n      Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror,\n      Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels\n      back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight\n      takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him\n      down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's\n      eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.\n      WHAM!\n\n      From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat\n      across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of\n      him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we   see\n      Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch\n      drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again.\n                               CAROLINE\n                       (level)\n                Get away from him or I will kill\n                you.\n      Toby manages to stand up, Caroline speaks to both of them.\n                                 CAROLINE\n                What is this?\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              116.\n144   CONTINUED:   (4)                                            144\n                              TOBY\n                I got the scholarship and he went\n                nuts.

Caroline grabs him, saying,\n      \"No. No. No,\" over and over, literally dragging Toby\n      away from Dwight.\n      Caroline looks at Dwight.\n                              CAROLINE\n                It's not so much that you're\n                disappointing -- it's that you're\n                consistently disappointing.\n                              DWIGHT\n                Oh, fancy, fancy talk -- fancy\n                talk for a whore.
