TONY\n    BENNETT sings \"Rags to Riches\" on the SOUNDTRACK.\n    Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a\n    highway.\n    The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors\n    up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-\n    per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and\n    cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.\n\n\n<b>2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2\n</b>    Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her\n    son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,\n    she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works\n    at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a\n    fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and\n    energetic and lively. Even more important than these\n    qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of\n    all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is\n    effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes\n    and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.\n    The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won-\n    derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of\n    adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self-\n    assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old\n    kid.\n    Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored\n    and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with\n    Caroline, who is ignoring him.\n<b>                              TOBY\n</b>               ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious\n               -- I do.

Let me just...\n    So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish\n    her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car\n    crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with\n    relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.\n<b>                            CAROLINE\n</b>              What'd you say?\n<b>                            TOBY\n</b>              I said -- for the twentieth time\n              -- if a person promises somebody\n              something, they can't just turn\n              around and take it back.\n<b>                            CAROLINE\n</b>              Oh, honey, Jesus.

Both of them\n    look through the back window and see a huge tractor-\n    trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.\n    Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the\n    NASH safely onto the side of the road.\n    The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and\n    slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the\n    next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into\n    empty space, its HORN still BLARING.\n    Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out\n    of the car.\n\n\n<b>3   EXT.

It's a hard shove, but nothing\n     that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before\n     between these two, and they recognize it.

The frosty air from the open window causes\n     his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips,\n     pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the\n     steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow\n     a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE\n     again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig-\n     arette.

He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going\n     to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID\n     SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then\n     his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate\n     smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline.\n\n     There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her\n     position, and someone in the crowd yells out, \"Oh, Mama,\n     shake that thang!\" Caroline ignores it, taking her\n     shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and\n     professional-looking.\n     She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once,\n     deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is\n     raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and\n     then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of\n     applause.\n\n<b>     SAME SCENE - LATER\n</b>     Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally\n     surprised.\n<b>                                                (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             32.\n</b><b>38   CONTINUED:                                                    38\n</b>     On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second\n     place and by only two shots.

Dwight's smile is even\n     bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win.\n     The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first\n     place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn.

He is\n     evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he\n     SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is\n     an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a\n     virtually perfect round.\n     Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but\n     clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right-\n     handed, then with both eyes closed.\n     His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter,\n     and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his\n     attitude says.\n     Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her\n     TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won.\n     The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone\n     else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official\n     presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a\n     pedestal, and a huge ham.\n     In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close\n     enough to congratulate his mother.

Holding her foot up, he kisses    the\n     instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then\n     down under the arch of her foot.

Arthur's second blow hits him in the\n     back of the head.\n     The fight is on.\n     Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action,\n     but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react,\n     Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker\n     that puts Toby   on his knees.\n     While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick\n     him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers\n     in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he\n     has lost his mind:\n\n<b>                             ARTHUR\n</b><b>               GET UP!

Then Toby gets in a solid punch to\n     Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his\n     heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded\n     buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and\n     begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,\n     still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes\n     with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the\n     two stagger around the street like drunken dancers.\n     They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with\n     each other again.\n     Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two\n     roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment.\n     They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting,\n     flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur,\n     then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each\n     breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives\n     out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him\n     deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby\n     throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER\n     BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.\n     Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully.\n     He looks relieved -- at least it's over.\n     No, it's not.\n     From behind him he hears three words.\n<b>                               ARTHUR\n</b>               Take it back.\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                               65.\n</b><b>71   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                71\n</b>     Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur\n     clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster\n     that won't   die.

Dwight,\n     Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an\n     Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a\n     corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's\n     playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.\n\n     Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes\n     the saxophone to squawk.\n     The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne\n     Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip\n     of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet,\n     and begins to dance with her.\n     A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances\n     Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the\n     kitchen, around the table, and then back again.\n     Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every\n     step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight\n     kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The\n     kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.\n<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                             75.\n</b><b>83   CONTINUED:                                              83\n</b>     Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table\n     and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's\n     head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure.\n     As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline\n     back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back\n     where she was seated exactly on the last note of the\n     song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline\n     smiles at Toby.\n<b>                             CAROLINE\n</b>                      (breathy)\n               Try to find the good stuff, honey.\n\n\n<b>84   INT.

Forgotten all this time, the beaver\n      has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of\n      what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,\n      the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.\n      Then Dwight says, \"Shit -- the roof must've leaked on\n      'em.\" Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight\n      on the ten boxes of chestnuts.\n      Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold,\n      too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking\n      stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a\n      breadpan.

While we see this, and   then\n      a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear:\n<b>                              NEWSCASTER (V.O.)\n</b>                ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana\n                Turner, was held for questioning\n                today in the stabbing death of\n                Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's\n                companion. A spokesman for Miss\n                Turner said today that the\n                stabbing was an accident, and that\n                Miss Turner's daughter will not\n                spend even one night in jail for\n                what the spokesman called a\n                'tragic accident.'\n      Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight\n      turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway,\n      also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching\n      the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at\n      Dwight.\n      Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the\n      Stompanato murder story continues.

Alone among all the other players, Toby wears\n      his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,\n      and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.\n      The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished\n      floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is\n      silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these\n      strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,\n      and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,\n      and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes\n      SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip\n      him up or cause another boy to stumble.\n\n      Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the\n      gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,\n      like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation\n      comedy.\n      Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.\n      Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while\n      his expression is hard as stone: he will get through\n      this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase\n      over and over: \"gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get\n      out, gotta get out.\" Finally he makes a basket. One\n      VOICE from the audience YELLS out \"Okay, kid -- way\n      to go!\" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants\n      later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.\n      The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS\n      heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's\n      expression never changes.\n\n\n<b>102   INT.

Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's\n      bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and\n      bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he\n      can.\n      Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously.
