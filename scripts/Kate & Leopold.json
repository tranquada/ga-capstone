VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY\n\n               CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.\n\n               The credits begin to roll.\n\n               Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in \n               preparation for a formal reception.\n\n               Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.\n\n               Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.\n\n               Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.\n\n               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.\n\n               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with \n               decorative garnish.\n\n               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting \n               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, \n               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and \n               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, \n               sour look.\n\n               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared \n               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet \n               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing \n               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The \n               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.\n\n               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.\n\n               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, \n               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From \n               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A \n               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.\n\n               EXT. ESTATE - DAY\n\n               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a \n               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, \n               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He \n               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.\n\n               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the \n               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING\n\n               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly \n               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. \n               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling \n               the staff to clean up the mess.\n\n               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS\n\n               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.\n\n               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.\n\n               Hot water is poured into a bath.\n\n               Carriages begin to arrive.\n\n               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.\n\n               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.\n\n               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat \n               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens \n               a corset around his mid-section from behind.\n\n               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.\n\n               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver \n               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch \n               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.\n\n               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet \n               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold \n               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and \n               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.\n\n               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his \n               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.\n\n               CLOSE UP\n\n               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.\n\n               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.\n\n               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.\n\n               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.\n\n               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.\n\n               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails \n               to the knees is fitted to his torso.\n\n               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.\n\n               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.\n\n               His cheeks are pinched.\n\n               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.\n\n               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He \n               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a \n               waffle:\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You dance like a herd of cattle, \n                         Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman \n                         who lights up the room... simply by \n                         leaving it.\n\n               He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, \n               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold \n               in the looking glass.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join \n                         us downstairs after completing this \n                         one-sided flash of wit?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle \n                         Otto. No one really listens to anyone \n                         else. If you attempt it, you will \n                         see why.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                         You judge everything too severely. I \n                         wonder what would happen if you were \n                         to cast that critical eye inward?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You do not wonder at all. You merely \n                         ask in order to state your own \n                         opinion.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                         We are all concerned about you.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Ahh, here it comes.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                         Your life does not seem to have any \n                         direction. At the age of 25 a man is \n                         too young to do anything well. At 35 \n                         he is too old. Now is your time to \n                         take action. Tell me, what is it you \n                         want to DO with your life?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (wearily)\n                         I do not know.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                              (just as weary)\n                         Your ignorance cramps my conversation.\n                              (he slaps Leopold's \n                              face twice rather \n                              quickly)\n                         Wake up! This is your one and only \n                         life. Every man has the chance to \n                         make a difference. DO something!\n\n               Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I am most grateful for your \n                         surveillance and for your sympathy. \n                         I assure you there is no need for \n                         concern. I am as effectual and \n                         attentive... as my position allows.\n\n                                     UNCLE OTTO\n                         Life is not position, Leopold. It is \n                         action.\n                              (he straightens \n                              Leopold's tie)\n                         I will see you downstairs promptly. \n                         In the appropriate frame of mind.\n\n               He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. \n               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. \n               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.\n\n               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He \n               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...\n\n                                     THE VALET\n                              (grandly)\n                         Go spread joy.\n\n               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian \n               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance \n               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is \n               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting \n               God.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n\n               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically \n               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly \n               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.\n\n               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing \n               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out \n               of frame.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of \n               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away \n               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows \n               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams \n               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky \n               teeth.\n\n               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of \n               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he \n               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except \n               her enormous bosom.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You dance like an angel, Miss \n                         Fairchild. You light up the room. I \n                         thank you.\n\n               Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, \n               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.\n\n               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She \n               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. \n               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Good evening. I do not believe I \n                         have had the pleasure.\n\n               The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes \n               he is addressing her. She puts her pad away.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         ...Julia Carlson.\n\n               Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (slightly tipsy)\n                         You are not from the area, are you?\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                              (smiles and shakes \n                              her head \"No\")\n                         Are you?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         This is my estate.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         Really?\n                              (looking around the \n                              room)\n                         Well it's not home but it's much...\n\n               Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There \n               is a hubbub amongst the guests.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't \n                         it?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         It is a scandal nonetheless.\n\n               Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Miss Carlson, do me the honor?\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (smiling seductively)\n                         Truly I would be in your debt. Any \n                         admonition would be erased simply by \n                         presenting a partner as lovely as \n                         yourself.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         No, no. Really, I...\n\n               Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, \n               takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.\n\n               They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing \"TA-RA-RA-\n               BOOM-DE-AY.\" Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, \n               shy at first, eventually smiles brightly.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I suppose we really ought to sing \n                         along.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         Oh, golly.\n\n               They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their \n               emphasis on \"BOOM.\" Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes \n               freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                              (breathless)\n                         Thank you for the dance. It was \n                         lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful \n                         for you.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Not at all. It was most enlightening.\n\n               There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes \n               midnight.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         I really must be going.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I won't hear of it.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                              (moving away from him)\n                         No, I'm quite late as it is.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I shall see you to the door...\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                              (stopping him \n                              resolutely)\n                         You're very sweet.

He \n               watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard \n               door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her.\n\n               EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the \n               dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes \n               back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She \n               is once again writing in her notebook.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Miss Carlson?\n\n               Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. \n               Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, \n               MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting \n               a weird glow.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Good God...\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         What are you...? You frightened me.\n\n               Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch \n               it...\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         What sort of mechanism is this?\n\n               Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Answer me!\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         It's perfectly all right.

Instinctively he pulls away, \n               accidentally thrusting the lever into action.

LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. \n               Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up \n               to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright \n               fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to \n               rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. \n               He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button \n               ON.\n\n               Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before \n               an excited crowd.\n\n               Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of \n               him as if shooing away a bee.

He remains very still. Composing himself, \n               he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he \n               purposefully steps back inside.\n\n               He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted \n               by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. \n               He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly \n               examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room.\n\n               He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks \n               the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment \n               in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself.\n\n               Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the \n               lights, laughing like a madman.

M.\n\n               Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to \n               sing, \"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off.\" Dressed in yoga \n               clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs \n               the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings.

Leopold sits at the table ringing \n               a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the \n               blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is \n               BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every \n               cupboard door is OPEN.

CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING\n\n               Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open \n               closet.

HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom.

BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\n               Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a \"Whitecap\" \n               marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He \n               picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. \n               It SPRAYS.\n\n               CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He \n               discovers the clapper has been stolen.\n\n               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON\n\n               Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks \n               up and stops suddenly.\n\n               Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of \n               Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, \n               bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses \n               foppishly.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I should like to read about modern \n                         currency during my bath tonight. See \n                         that the tub and basin are scrubbed \n                         up. Remnants remain of this afternoons \n                         shave.\n\n               Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of \n               clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing \n               skis.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds.\n\n               INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\n               He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. \n               Each are wearing a walkman.\n\n               He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously \n               until they look up.\n\n               INT. STUDY - DAY\n\n               Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian \n               customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. \n               A beat.\n\n               Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles \n               papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work.\n\n               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. \n               She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty \n               room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, \n               she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the \n               window and looks out.\n\n               INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the \n               brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. \n               He moves to the window and looks out.\n\n               EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly \n               pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city.\n\n               INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON\n\n               Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         In our last session you intimated \n                         there was a symmetrical system \n                         regulating the social order of \n                         conformity spanning your era. I found \n                         this particularly intriguing If I \n                         can just find it in my notes...\n\n               A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then \n               turns back, excited.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         The fire brigade!\n\n               Kate stares at him blankly.

I'm coming \n                         out. Nobody laugh.\n\n               Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE \n               that she is STUNNING.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Satisfied?\n\n               Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         ...What?\n\n               She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands \n               behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You have a lovely face.\n\n               Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at \n               herself for a long while.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (quietly)\n                         We'll take the dress.\n\n               They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously \n               part.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and \n               hands him the remote control.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         What is this?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         The drug of the 20th century.\n\n               She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's \n               spellbound.\n\n               INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits \n               on the sofa watching the TV.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leopold, your dinner's getting cold.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I'm coming.\n\n               He does not move a muscle.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and \n               watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys \n               this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold \n               grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (making notes)\n                         It's a guy thing.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. \n               Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. \n               She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to \n               capture a better look at his face.\n\n               After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand \n               and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. \n               Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She \n               looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles.\n\n               Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to \n               the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly \n               mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably.\n\n               She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins \n               pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again.\n\n               INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes \n               area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and \n               several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for \n               solutions.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         ...Now within that astronomical \n                         structure, Dr. Drake here is searching \n                         for a pathway between your time and \n                         the present. He'll find it too if \n                         his arteries don't harden first.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Astounding.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Once that is discovered, the search \n                         begins for the exact time and date \n                         travel will be possible.\n\n               They move to Dr. Kau's area.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (to Dr. Kau)\n                         How are you proceeding?\n\n               Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Don't take it personally. Once Dr. \n                         Kau starts working, you just have to \n                         wait until her batteries run down. \n                         We're all pretty much like that.\n\n               They head into Kate's office.\n\n               INT. KATE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Kate gathers her belongings, Leopold snoops at her notes.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         The complexity of this equation is \n                         astonishing?

That's why therapists \n                         can charge so much.\n\n               As she gathers her belongings, Leopold spots a very high \n               heeled red shoe in Kate's bag.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         What exactly transpires during \n                         therapy?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leopold.

STREET - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Kate heads down the stairs of a subway station. A few feet \n               behind, Leopold cautiously follows.\n\n               INT. SUBWAY STATION - RUSH HOUR\n\n               Kate waits in line at the turnstile. Leopold, a ways back, \n               grimaces noticeably at the smell.\n\n               Kate heads through. Leopold follows banging painfully into \n               the bar. A NUN hurriedly bumps into him from behind.\n\n               He tries pushing the bar but it doesn't budge. He turns around \n               to step out of line but it is already too long. He stands \n               NOSE to NOSE with the nun.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I can't seem to...\n\n                                     NUN\n                              (impatiently)\n                         Oh, for heaven's sake...\n\n               The nun deposits her token and SQUEEZES them both through as \n               the train arrives at a deafening pitch, startling Leopold.\n\n               He spots Kate entering the train and jumps into the car in \n               the nick of time. The train departs, Leopold pressed awkwardly \n               against the glass.\n\n               EXT. N.Y.C. STREET - EARLY EVENING\n\n               Kate races from the subway station, entering the Arthur Murray \n               Dance Studio. Leopold, thoroughly disheveled, follows at a \n               distance.\n\n               INT. DANCE STUDIO - EVENING\n\n               Elderly Blue haired couples chat amongst themselves, men on \n               the right, women on the left. Kate, in dance clothes, out of \n               breath, stumbles in, making a b-line for the women's side.\n\n                                     MRS. PINCUS\n                         I was worried. I thought you weren't \n                         going to make it.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (smiling happily)\n                         Miss my lesson?

Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus?\n\n               Mrs. Pincus executes a fancy spin, proudly showing off her \n               purchase. Across the room, MR. Pincus beams in anticipation.\n\n               An elderly, overly made up dance instructor enters. She claps \n               her hands together loudly.\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR\n                         All right, kids. Pair up!\n\n               The men slick back their hair. The women straighten their \n               gowns. Kate stands to the side, self-consciously studying \n               the floor.\n\n               The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick \n               their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, \n               elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while \n               Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music \n               plays.\n\n               The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate \n               dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a \n               beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING \n               look spread across her face.\n\n               The instructor approaches with a look of resignation.\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR\n                         Don't think so much, Katie.

It should \n                         be a vacation the body takes from \n                         the mind. Let the music wash over \n                         you.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (frustrated)\n                         It is!\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR\n                         Repeat after me: I've got the muusic \n                         in me.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I've got the muusic in me.\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR & KATE\n                              (overlapping)\n                         I've got the muusic in me!\n\n                                     INSTRUCTOR\n                         Keep telling yourself that.\n\n               Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away.\n\n               Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved.\n\n               LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling \n               couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her \n               imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, \n               muttering to herself, dancing alone.\n\n               INT.

As the song builds:\n\n               Charlie enters leading Leopold throughout the room. Leopold \n               matches Charlie EXACTLY step by step so tightly they appear \n               to be one person marching happily about.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

Leopold watches calmly. Charlie selects a song. \n               Instantly, Leopold's shoulders rise up to his ears.

CENTRAL PARK - DAY\n\n               Charlie and Leopold walk through the park.

No \n                         woman wants to be romanced by a \n                         buffoon.\n                              (the old woman shakes \n                              her head)\n                         Banter and repartee are fine but you \n                         must add to that a different sort of \n                         playfulness.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         You think I should pounce?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I'm saying you must treat her with \n                         respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude \n                         pass.

LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Kate enters with an arm load of Leopold's discarded clothes. \n               She drops them on his bed and begins to hang them in his \n               closet.\n\n               A notebook falls from his pants pocket. She puts it on the \n               bureau. A beat. She quickly picks it up, sits on the edge of \n               the bed and starts to read.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (reading out loud)\n                         Royal family -- Uncouth.

Raises her voice when she \n                         knows she's wrong. BOSSY, BOSSY, \n                         BOSSY. Lose my train of thought when \n                         I see her smile. Most beautiful when \n                         she's angry. Honorable heart... \n                         Peasant feet.\n\n               The front door is heard slamming. Kate, alarmed, stuffs the \n               notebook back in Leopold's pocket. She races to the door; \n               glances back at the notebook, turns off the light and scurries \n               from the room.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n               The corridor is darkly lit. Kate leaves the bathroom as \n               Leopold enters. They collide and separate but remain close \n               together. Both are dressed in pajamas and speak softly.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Ooops.

As close as bread \n                         and butter.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I see.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         So.

PATRICE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Charlie stands at Patrice's door with a large painting. He \n               looks over at Leopold hiding the next doorway over.

I've \n                         got too much work to do. Ask Charlie \n                         though. He'll go with you.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the \n                         same.

Kate takes a moment \n               then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. \n               After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with \n               her foot and starts banging on the top of it.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Oh for crying out loud.

CENTRAL PARK - DAY\n\n               Leopold trots his horse expertly along the horse path. Kate \n               follows, clutching the horses neck, bouncing like a clown.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I...

Couples in \n               Sheeps Meadow.\n\n               Holding the reins of Kate's horse in one hand, Leopold grasps \n               Kate's waist with the other as they ride a single horse \n               through the greenery of Central Park.\n\n               EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - THE THALIA - DAY\n\n               A revival house. On the Marquee: \"The Tenuous Duke\" starring \n               Ronald Coleman.\n\n               INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY\n\n               Kate and Leopold eat popcorn, Milk Duds, M & M's, and large \n               drinks. The lights go down and the movie begins.\n\n               The enormity of the medium strikes Leopold at once. He \n               involuntarily leans back in his chair grabbing Kate's \n               shoulder, watching attentively. After a bit:\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Is that supposed to be my hair? Do \n                         you see how they think my hair looks?\n\n               Kate looks over at Leopold and nods. Through his eyes, she \n               too experiences movies for the first time. She moves close \n               to him.\n\n               EXT.

Leopold stares blankly at an empty white \n               canvas. He turns to Kate questioningly.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         That's simplicity in it's purest \n                         form. It speaks volumes in it's \n                         nothingness. Whiteness representing \n                         emptiness. Hopelessness. It's bleak. \n                         Bleak!\n\n               Leopold eyes the painting skeptically. They move to the next \n               object d'art. A toilet.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Aaand this represents...?\n\n               They burst into giddy laughter.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Absolutely nothing.\n\n               They round the corner, moving to the next room. Leopold's \n               smile fades.\n\n               CLOSE UP: A painting of privileged Victorian society.\n\n               Shaken, he gazes at a painting in a dream-like state.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (very quietly)\n                         I'd almost forgotten how beautiful \n                         it was.

Now, escort me in.\n\n               Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, \n               Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. \n               Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom \n               in a tight BLACK dress.\n\n               Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie \n               sits down, pleased.

He is not there.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Oh, Leopold...\n\n               She runs into Charlie's studio and stops short.\n\n               Next to Charlie's stern paintings, Leopold's portrait of \n               Kate shines in the moonlight. She wears an antique dress. \n               She is lovely. Kate sees herself as Leopold sees her and is \n               touched. She turns and collides head on with Leopold.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Oh!\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Bread and butter.\n\n               He is wearing gloves and an apron. He rubs his bruised head, \n               inadvertently leaving a trail of suds along his face.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         You're back early. Did you enjoy \n                         your date?\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (happily)\n                         No.\n\n               She moves in close, trying to remove the soap from his face.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Here, you've got some...\n\n               He wipes his face making it much worse.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Is it gone?\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (laughing)\n                         No.\n\n               She uses the apron to wipe away the soap. They gaze at each \n               other and become serious.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (softly)\n                         A funny thing happened to me on my \n                         bland date this evening, Leopold. I \n                         really can't explain it. This puffed-\n                         up, puritanical, blundering, greenhorn \n                         kept popping into my mind all night \n                         long at the most inopportune times. \n                         I couldn't get rid of him.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         How inconsiderate.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Yeah, it was. The harder I tried, \n                         the more persistent he became. He's \n                         conceited and inflated and unseasoned \n                         and it doesn't seem to matter... \n                         He's 134 years old but I can't get \n                         him out of my head.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Is he there right now?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Right here. Larger than life.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I'll protect you...\n\n               They kiss. A long romantic passionate kiss.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Dr. Coles, would you grant me license \n                         to dine with you tomorrow evening at \n                         eight o'clock?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Permission granted.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Until tomorrow, then.\n\n               They separate. A beat. Leopold gestures for Kate to go first. \n               They head down the hallway together into their separate rooms.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The table clock chimes eight times. Leopold enters from the \n               kitchen dressed perfectly in the most UP TO DATE style. He \n               carries a casserole dish.\n\n               A second later Kate enters from the hallway. She is wearing \n               an OLD FASHIONED, ANTIQUE DRESS. She looks lovely.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (a little startled)\n                         You look beautiful.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         YOU do. What have you got there?\n\n               Leopold opens the casserole dish.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Hamburger Helper!\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I know you like it.\n\n               Kate smiles. She looks behind him into the kitchen. A COLOSSAL \n               MESS. Leopold lights the candles and pulls out her chair. \n               This time she's prepared. He slides her chair to the table.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n               The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow \n               throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful \n               World\" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Tell me more.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Um, where was I? So after my father \n                         died I had to go to work.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Have you had many jobs?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Many. I got fired from all of them. \n                         I'm the most unskilled person I know. \n                         But they were just survival jobs \n                         while I was still in school. I always \n                         knew I wanted to go into science \n                         like my father. And I did.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Do you miss him?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I think about him every day. He was \n                         courtly, just like you.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I think you are a remarkable woman \n                         Katherine Coles.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         You just don't get out much. You'd \n                         be surprised how remarkable I'm not.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         No, it is you who would be surprised.\n\n               They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They \n               kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They \n               look at each other, deciding.\n\n               Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Kate...\n\n               Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads \n               him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING\n\n               Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two \n               figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the \n               figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing:\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Good morning.\n\n                                     PATRICE\n                         Morning.\n\n               They kiss.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING\n\n               Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is \n               set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from \n               the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see \n               each other for the first time.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Morning.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Good morning.\n\n               They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Look what you've done!\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         It's nothing.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Nothing? My own mother never made me \n                         a breakfast like this.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I will have to have a talk with her.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leopold...\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Kate...\n\n                                     KATE\n                         About last night...\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Please sit down.\n\n               He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Kate, I had never before been a \n                         considerate man. I had, with \n                         astonishing complacency, squandered \n                         my life, waiting for some incentive \n                         to force me into action. You have \n                         made me see how rare our time here \n                         really is. I am most beholden to you \n                         Kate. And always will be.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I sense the word \"BUT\" entering into \n                         this any minute now.\n\n               Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, \n               bracing for worst.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming \n                         my wife.\n\n               Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Shall I take that as a \"yes\"?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry \n                         you?\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         I love you, Kate.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         That's entirely beside the point... \n                         You're moving way too fast here. \n                         Shouldn't we date first? I mean it's \n                         obvious the first one went well...\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Where I come from that's pretty much \n                         the way it works.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leopold, even though last night we... \n                         loved each other, that doesn't mean \n                         this morning we're engaged. It just \n                         doesn't work that way now.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (taking a ring off \n                              his fingers and \n                              placing it on hers)\n                         I have loved you since I first set \n                         eyes on you. I cannot imagine my \n                         life without you beside me. I want \n                         to marry you, Kate and make an honest \n                         woman of you.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Oh Leopold, sit down.\n\n               They switch places. Leopold sits and Kate kneels beside him.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Relationships these days are much \n                         more complicated than that. Women \n                         today have certain freedoms that men \n                         have been taking advantage of for \n                         centuries. You must have been aware \n                         of that. If you think about it \n                         clearly, it should be obvious to you \n                         that marriage between us is out of \n                         the question.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Do you not love me Kate?\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (almost inaudible)\n                         Don't ever think that...\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Then consider my proposal.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I'll think it over but I can tell \n                         you now the answer is...\n\n               He kisses her.

He studies the two of them and nonchalant sits at the \n               table. Kate and Leopold serve themselves breakfast.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                              (to Kate)\n                         Coffee?\n\n               Kate nods.

He \n               eyes Leopold suspiciously. Leopold concentrates on his plate.\n\n               Charlie gives Kate a questioning glance. She smiles at him, \n               looking both innocent and guilty at the same time. After a \n               beat:\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Uh huh.\n\n               All smile privately and sip their coffee without another \n               word.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. LAB - NIGHT\n\n               Buried behind open books and crumpled up paper, Kate labors \n               in earnest.\n\n               She stops suddenly, almost violently, and studies the notes \n               in front of her. The coffee cup falls from her hand and \n               breaks.\n\n                                     DR.

I'm fine.\n\n               She covers her papers and self consciously cleans up her \n               mess. She sits down slowly and peeks at her notes. She has \n               SOLVED THE PUZZLE that will send Leopold back.\n\n               She looks up in disbelief and glances through her window \n               around the lab. Everyone is hard at work. Helplessly, she \n               stares back at the paper on her desk.\n\n               She pulls open her drawer and takes out the picture of \n               Carlson. She stares at it for a long time. She opens her \n               mouth to call for the others, stops, and looks at the photo.\n\n               Slowly, with great indecision, Kate crumples up the paper. \n               She returns the picture to the drawer. After a long moment, \n               she opens a book, feigning research, her mind a million miles \n               away.\n\n               INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. \n               Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at \n               Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles \n               sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She \n               snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together.\n\n               EXT.

Finally, exhausted, he \n               winds up walking along Central Park South.\n\n               Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out.

JULIA CARLSON pulls up \n               in her car.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         Hi. Does Katherine Coles live here?\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Yeah.\n                              (yelling inside)\n                         MOM??\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         You're Leo aren't you? You don't \n                         remember me but I knew you when you \n                         were yea big.\n                              (she holds her hands \n                              an inch apart)\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         I'm Julia. I'm an old friend of your \n                         mothers.\n\n                                     LEO\n                              (proudly)\n                         We had spaghetti at our house 4 times \n                         this week.\n\n               Kate comes out on the porch. She looks lovely.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Leo you don't have to holler like \n                         that. I'm not deaf...\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         Kate?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         ...Carlson?!\n\n               The two women scream, run to each other and embrace.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Carlson, I don't believe it. It's \n                         been... I don't know how many years. \n                         What are you doing here.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         I came to see you, sweetie.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         You remember my son, Leo?\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         We've just been getting acquainted.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Well, come inside. Come inside.\n\n               INT. KATE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Kate heads straight for the kitchen. Carlson scans the living \n               room before joining her.\n\n               Although rustic on the outside, the inside of the house is \n               furnished with antiques and is Victorian in style.\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (covering her agitation)\n                         Would you like some tea? I wish you \n                         had called before you come over. It \n                         would have given me a chance to \n                         straighten up the house... myself... \n                         my life. Tell me what you've been up \n                         to. Catch me up on everyone. I heard \n                         you received some big endowment or \n                         something. I was going to write, \n                         then call, but...\n\n               She picks up the cup and saucer but it shakes so violently \n               she has to put it down.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         It's all right, Kate. I understand.\n\n               There is a LONG PAUSE. Carlson gets the tea ready. Finally:\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a \n                         lot of time to get your affairs in \n                         order... And I warn you, it's nearly \n                         impossible for an intelligent woman \n                         back there.\n\n               Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would \n                         be proud. We're aware of your \n                         situation but we felt when the time \n                         came, you deserved the option.\n\n               Kate nods, trembling slightly.\n\n               INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off.\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Who was that lady?\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Just an old friend.\n\n                                     LEO\n                         What she want?\n\n                                     KATE\n                              (she looks at Leo)\n                         Nothing important. You brush your \n                         teeth?\n\n               Leo shows off his teeth.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Then give your old mom a hug and go \n                         to bed.\n                              (Leo gives her a hug \n                              and a kiss)\n                         Good night, cookie.\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Good night.\n\n               Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the \n               house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear \n               are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking.\n\n               She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits \n               down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in \n               thought.\n\n               She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls \n               out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look \n               through.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               THE PHOTO ALBUM\n\n               Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, \n               magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life.\n\n               A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he \n               departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for \n               a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It \n               is the same ring Kate gave him.\n\n               A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to \n               establish a scientific center researching studies in time \n               and space.\n\n               A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, \n               marching to give women the vote.\n\n               A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, \n               stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing \n               to his ring.\n\n               A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing \n               a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded \n               by academia and subtly points to his ring.\n\n               A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with \n               Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras.\n\n               A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting \n               regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one \n               hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against \n               his chest, showing off the ring.\n\n               An obituary with the headline, \"Philanthropist, 80, dies in \n               bombings.\n\n               A tear falls on the page.\n\n               Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera \n               follows her gaze past her property...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER\n\n               LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time \n               as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, \n               older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder.\n\n               Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, \n               approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         He's so YOUNG, Charlie.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         He's old enough.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Look at that idiotic expression on \n                         his face.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         He's happy.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Of course he's happy. All weddings \n                         are happy. It's the living together \n                         afterwards that causes all the \n                         trouble.\n\n               Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet \n               hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching.\n\n               Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, \n               over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the \n               guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, \n               Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN.\n\n               Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. \n               Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not \n               wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Oh, you're so young... I love you, \n                         Leo. Always remember that...\n\n               From behind, her shoulders shake as she cries.\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Mom, we're only moving to Denver.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         I know, cookie. I know.\n\n               INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT\n\n               From behind a glass partition, Carlson works at her console. \n               A monitor counts away the seconds. 59, 58, 57... In the \n               darkened lab, Kate, dressed in early 1920s attire, straps \n               herself in and smiles tearfully. Their voices echo in the \n               lab.\n\n                                     KATE\n                         Well...\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         I know.

He looks to his wife then \n               back at Kate. He nods his head.\n\n                                     LEO\n                         Go.\n\n               They force themselves to smile, trying to get through the \n               moment.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         Ready!\n\n               Charlie, Leo and his new bride stand back. Inside the craft, \n               the only light comes from the glowing red lever. Carlson \n               raises her arm, signaling Kate. Then to her staff:\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         9, 8, 7...\n\n               Kate presses her hand against the glass as a final goodbye. \n               She grabs the lever with her other hand and turns away, \n               staring straight ahead. Charlie puts his arm around Leo.\n\n                                     CARLSON\n                         3, 2, 1!\n\n               There is a BRIGHT WHITE FLASH. Kate is gone.

A LARGE VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1924 - NIGHT\n\n               A FLASH of light illuminates the forest at the Albany estate. \n               A BEAT. Kate races from the forest onto a massive lawn, \n               stumbling in mud as she hurries to the mansion's entrance.\n\n               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Huge double doors open to reveal -- AN ORNATE BALLROOM. The \n               creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed, \n               rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses \n               a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance \n               floor.\n\n               In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very \n               distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young \n               woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance.\n\n                                     FLIRT\n                              (brushing his shirt \n                              front)\n                         I just love a starched white shirt. \n                         It's so elegant.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Thank you.\n\n                                     FLIRT\n                         Skeeky.\n\n                                     LEOPOLD\n                         Yes. You dance like an angel Miss \n                         Beall. You light up the room around \n                         you. I thank you.\n\n                                     FLIRT\n                              (with a big smile)\n                         Thank YOU.\n\n               The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a \n               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the \n               staircase.\n\n               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every \n               turn as Kate searches each male face.\n\n               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up \n               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up \n               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, \n               flouncing down the stairs.\n\n               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks \n               for Leopold.\n\n               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. \n               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns \n               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.\n\n               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.\n\n               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then \n               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold \n               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at \n               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her \n               his hand.\n\n               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their \n               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT \n               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her \n               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. \n               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment \n               of youth, when they fell in love.\n\n               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He \n               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands \n               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he \n               wraps his arms tightly around her.\n\n               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes \n               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count \n               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.\n\n               THEY DANCE...\n\n               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.\n\n                                     LORD WHITEHEAD\n                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?\n\n                                     LADY WHITEHEAD\n                         I've never seen her before.\n\n               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze \n               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.\n\n               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The \n               rest of the world dances around them.\n\n               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO \n               SCREEN.\n\n               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate \n               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly \n               point to their rings.\n\n               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for \n               studies in physics.\n\n               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to \n               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.\n\n               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It \n               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching \n               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly \n               into the camera, they show off their rings.\n\n               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...\n\n               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost \n               in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we...\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nKate & Leopold\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0James Mangold\u00a0\u00a0Steven Rogers\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Romance\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:35.327751"}
