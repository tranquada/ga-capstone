KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n               Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.\n\n               Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.\n\n               Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with \n               decorative garnish.\n\n               Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting \n               enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, \n               pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and \n               flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, \n               sour look.\n\n               The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared \n               silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15.\n\n<b>               INT. BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\n               Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet \n               throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing \n               a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The \n               valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.\n\n               The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.\n\n               Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, \n               selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From \n               beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A \n               weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit.\n\n<b>               EXT. ESTATE - DAY\n</b>\n               The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a \n               dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, \n               he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He \n               sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.\n\n               In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the \n               estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows.\n\n<b>               INT. HALLWAY - EVENING\n</b>\n               Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly \n               scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. \n               Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling \n               the staff to clean up the mess.\n\n<b>               SERIES OF CLOSE UPS\n</b>\n               Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.\n\n               A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.\n\n               Hot water is poured into a bath.\n\n               Carriages begin to arrive.\n\n               Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.\n\n               Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire.\n\n<b>               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.\n\n               He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat \n               of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens \n               a corset around his mid-section from behind.\n\n               Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.\n\n               He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver \n               saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch \n               himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.\n\n               He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet \n               sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold \n               thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and \n               saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.\n\n               Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his \n               hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.\n\n<b>               CLOSE UP\n</b>\n               Fine linen undervest slides over his head.\n\n               Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.\n\n               The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.\n\n               A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.\n\n               A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.\n\n               An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails \n               to the knees is fitted to his torso.\n\n               His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.\n\n               His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.\n\n               His cheeks are pinched.\n\n               A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.\n\n               Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He \n               raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a \n               waffle:\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         You dance like a herd of cattle, \n                         Miss Fairchild.

As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, \n               a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold \n               in the looking glass.\n\n<b>                                     UNCLE OTTO\n</b>                         Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join \n                         us downstairs after completing this \n                         one-sided flash of wit?\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle \n                         Otto.

At the age of 25 a man is \n                         too young to do anything well. At 35 \n                         he is too old. Now is your time to \n                         take action.

Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. \n               The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. \n               Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.\n\n               Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He \n               hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally...\n\n<b>                                     THE VALET\n</b>                              (grandly)\n                         Go spread joy.\n\n               Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.\n\n<b>               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian \n               society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance \n               card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is \n               MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting \n               God.\n\n<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically \n               into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly \n               SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.\n\n               Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing \n               suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out \n               of frame.\n\n<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of \n               19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away \n               shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows \n               into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams \n               up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky \n               teeth.\n\n               Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on.\n\n<b>               INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of \n               immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he \n               maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except \n               her enormous bosom.\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         You dance like an angel, Miss \n                         Fairchild.

Leopold glances at his card, \n               sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.\n\n               He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She \n               scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. \n               Hiding his dance card, he saunters over.\n\n<b>                                     LEOPOLD\n</b>                         Good evening.

Leopold heaves a \n               sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the \n               staircase.\n\n               The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every \n               turn as Kate searches each male face.\n\n               In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up \n               the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up \n               the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff, \n               flouncing down the stairs.\n\n               Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks \n               for Leopold.\n\n               Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs. \n               He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns \n               around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.\n\n               The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.\n\n               Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then \n               STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold \n               stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at \n               her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her \n               his hand.\n\n               The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their \n               eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT \n               AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her \n               shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone. \n               They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment \n               of youth, when they fell in love.\n\n               Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He \n               rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands \n               are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he \n               wraps his arms tightly around her.\n\n               MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes \n               a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count \n               silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.\n\n<b>               THEY DANCE...\n</b>\n               An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest.\n\n<b>                                     LORD WHITEHEAD\n</b>                         Who is that dancing with Leopold?\n\n<b>                                     LADY WHITEHEAD\n</b>                         I've never seen her before.\n\n               Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze \n               into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.\n\n               At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The \n               rest of the world dances around them.\n\n               Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO \n<b>               SCREEN.\n</b>\n               The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate \n               and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly \n               point to their rings.\n\n               Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for \n               studies in physics.\n\n               The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to \n               include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.\n\n               The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It \n               shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching \n               chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly \n               into the camera, they show off their rings.\n\n               SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...\n\n               Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost \n               in the crowd.
