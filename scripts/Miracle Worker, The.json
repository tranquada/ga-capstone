A shadow.of\n          the erratic, staggering figure of 5 year old HELEN appears\n          on the wall, moving slowly.

HELEN lashes out, her\n          face frightened, unknowing --- she pulls down a sheet, be-\n          comes tangled in its folds, almost hysterical.

HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball\n          and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND\n          AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS\n          hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face,\n          blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and\n          beyond her the other children watching.\n\n          $. DAY. EXT.
