PRISON FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE\n\nCorridor of ancient stone and steel extends into infinite\ndarkness. Stale air hangs in the dim half-light like\natomized ether.\nThere is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.\nDRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief\nflashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --\n\n\n\n\nFINAL CELL\n\nA gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a\nwall hung tapestry of Christ.

He pulls it\nout and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a\nNazi flag.\nAt the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches\nlong. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of\nsome prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.\nAs he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.\n\n\n\n\nMYSTERIOUS POV\n\nFrom BEHIND.

AGING APARTMENT BUILDING\n\nNot in a third world country but smack center in one of\nAmerica's richest cities.

ALLEY BY THE APARTMENT\n\nA faded yellow taxi PULLS UP and stops. Someone steps\nout, grinds a cigarette butt into the asphalt.\n\n\n\n\nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING - FOYER\n\nDoors open, flood the musty darkness with a brief relief\nof sunlight. A MAN -- whose face we don't see -- steps\ninside, his trench coat hanging like the folded wings of\na raven.\nHe pauses, pulls an ORNATE LIGHTER and lights a\ncigarette. Takes a puff and pushes on inside.\n\n\n\n\nINT. NARROW STAIRCASE HALL WALL\n\nLined with tenants trying to get a glimpse of the\nunexplainable.\nThe Stranger pushes through.

Hennessey gives him a\nwide berth.\nJohn walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a\nglance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing\ntip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the\nchild's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor\ninstantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of\nthe little girl and whispers --\n\n                        JOHN\n\n          This is Constantine.

He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS\nuntil the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look\naway.\nJohn stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely\npuzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.\n\n                        JOHN\n\n          I need a mirror. Now.\nShaken, the Mother produces a small compact.

Hennessey looks\nworried.\nJohn grabs the bed -- shoves Hennessey aside as he swings\nthe bed around, legs gouging hardwood all the way. Faces\nit toward the window.\n\n\n\n\nINTERCUT - APARTMENT 5G BELOW\n\nSeveral of the MEN from the hallway crowd storm through\nan OLD WOMAN'S stuffy apartment, locate a huge iron-\nframed mirror and rip it and half the plaster from the\nwall.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN\n\ncenters on a drapery ROPE, pulls hard.

HALLWAY\n\nFour men struggle to carry up that enormous mirror. The\nOld Woman follows, begs them to be gentle. They swing\nthe mirror around, take out a chunk of banister. She\nfreaks.\n\n\n\n\nINT. APARTMENT 7B\n\nHennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope\nthrough the fire escape railing, drapes it back through\nthe window and loops it over the ceiling fan.\nHe climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes\nhave closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to\nbe going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.\nJohn has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.\nDark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and\nEnglish.\n\n                        JOHN\n\n          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind\n          from the flesh I command thee --\nThe girl chokes as if ready to spit.\n\n                        JOHN\n\n          That's it -- time to go home.\nJeanie SCREAMS --\n\n                        JEANIE\n\n          Tiempo para morir!\nHer body suddenly PULSES half again larger.

He continues in Aramaic --\n\n                        JOHN\n\n          Amar natash bow basar --\nAnother PULSE and this time a SHAPE is clearly seen\nexpanding under the child's skin -- as if the demon\ninside were trying to burst right through.\nJohn backs off -- watches as the shape ripples her flesh,\nlike fingers caressing from the other side. John glances\nto Hennessey. What the hell?\nMIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.\nJohn waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.\n\n                         JOHN\n\n          Lift it.   Over the bed.

It's not just the image of a young\ngirl in there, but something else. The surface of the\nmirror FLEXES in the hands of the men.

Satan tears through his tissue --\ncollecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of\ndiseased tissue with one vengeful pull. John's final\nblood-curdling SCREAM ECHOES over --\n\n\n\n\nINT./EXT.

Jagged cartilage stumps\nprotrude from his back. A pattern of sinew and bone is\nburned into the floor behind him.
