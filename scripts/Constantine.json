And tangled VOICES.\nDRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief\nflashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --\n\n\n\n\n<b>FINAL CELL\n</b>\nA gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a\nwall hung tapestry of Christ.

A way out. Too high to\nreach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed\ncorner and slides it under the light.\nHe steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole\nand starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives\nway and his foot crunches through.\nPrisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees\nsomething inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it\nout and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a\nNazi flag.\nAt the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches\nlong. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of\nsome prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.\nAs he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.\n\n\n\n\n<b>MYSTERIOUS POV\n</b>\nFrom BEHIND.

DRIVER jumps out, sees the front\nend sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.\nHe scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is\nstunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.\nPrisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in\nhis hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL\nhas appeared as if embossed in the flesh.\nDriver calls out but the Prisoner is spooked, runs off.\nOVER this we hear -- A CHILD'S SCREAM.\n\n\n\n\n<b>INT.

AGING APARTMENT BUILDING\n</b>\nNot in a third world country but smack center in one of\nAmerica's richest cities. Sparkling high-rises tower in\nthe distance while flashy billboards tout the sexiest\nfashions, the hottest automobiles and the smoothest malt\nliquor.\n\n<b>SUPERIMPOSE:   LOS ANGELES - TODAY\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Hennessey gives him a\nwide berth.\nJohn walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a\nglance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing\ntip drooped over the edge. He puts a gloved hand to the\nchild's face and it burns on contact. His demeanor\ninstantly changes as he leans right next to the ear of\nthe little girl and whispers --\n\n<b>                        JOHN\n</b>\n          This is Constantine.

He flips through each of these sculptured SAINTS\nuntil the child suddenly reacts to one -- tries to look\naway.\nJohn stares at the Saint responsible, seems genuinely\npuzzled. He turns to the Mother -- very serious.\n\n<b>                        JOHN\n</b>\n          I need a mirror. Now.\nShaken, the Mother produces a small compact.

APARTMENT 7B\n</b>\nHennessey can only watch as John threads the drapery rope\nthrough the fire escape railing, drapes it back through\nthe window and loops it over the ceiling fan.\nHe climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes\nhave closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to\nbe going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.\nJohn has no choice -- slaps her. Eyes pop back open.\nDark and dilated. He yells down at her in Aramaic and\nEnglish.\n\n<b>                        JOHN\n</b>\n          Amar natash bow basar! -- Rescind\n          from the flesh I command thee --\nThe girl chokes as if ready to spit.\n\n<b>                        JOHN\n</b>\n          That's it -- time to go home.\nJeanie SCREAMS --\n\n<b>                        JEANIE\n</b>\n          Tiempo para morir!\nHer body suddenly PULSES half again larger.

John glances\nto Hennessey. What the hell?\nMIRROR arrives at the doorway, BANGS against the JAM.\nJohn waves them in. The four men heft it into the room.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>\n          Lift it.   Over the bed.

It's not just the image of a young\ngirl in there, but something else. The surface of the\nmirror FLEXES in the hands of the men.

The demon in him? He touches his face, does a\nvowel stretch. His face distorts even further.\nThat's got him moving closer to the mirror.\nBalthazar's concerned because now his skin appears\nin motion, rippling as if liquefied. And just when he\nsees the surface of the mirror BLISTERING and starts to\nmove --\n\n<b>BOOOM --\n</b>\nOne way GLASS EXPLODES outward on the front edge of a\nFIREBALL -- sending Balthazar flying with glass and\nflame.\nJohn stands on the other side in an ACCESS CHANNEL --\nthat Dragon's breath flamethrower now duct-taped to his\nholy shotgun.\n\n<b>                           JOHN\n</b>\n             How's he doing it?\nJohn steps into the trading room, eyes Balthazar rising\nfrom the floor.

He may be burned, but\nhe's one tough son of a bitch.\nBalthazar slides    John up a wall by his neck. John can't\nbreak his hold.     He's choking, frantically rummages\nthrough his coat    pockets. Comes out with those sacred\nGOLD KNUCKLES on    his right hand.\nBalthazar tightens his grip and John swings, clocks him\nacross the face. The enhanced punch sends a dizzying\nripple throughout Balthazar's body.\nBut he doesn't let go. John is choking, starts whaling\non him.
