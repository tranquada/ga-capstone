Katie, an\n    attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of\n    the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.\n\n                         KATIE\n               You're home.\n\n    Osbourne continues making himself a drink.\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               Hang on to your hat, honey.

You tried? And then----\n               what, the aphasia kicked in?\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               Our guests came.

Yes?

YACHT/AT SEA - DAY                                        9\n\n    THE BRIDGE\n\n    A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in\n    his face, as the boat sails under motor power.\n\n    After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.\n\n    An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the\n    wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a\n    tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.\n\n                           OSBOURNE\n                 You okay there, Dad?\n\n    The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to\n    him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the\n    man's knees.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... Dad, I left my job at the\n                 Agency...\n\n    The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,\n                 government service is not what it was\n                 when you were in State. Things are\n                 different now. I don't know, maybe\n                 it's... it's... the Cold War ending;\n                 now it seems like it's all bureaucracy\n                 and no mission...\n\n    The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n                 ... I'm writing a memoir. I think\n                 it's going to be pretty explosive.\n                 But I don't think you'll disapprove.\n                 I don't think you'll disapprove.\n                 Katie has had trouble accepting it.\n                           (MORE)\n\n                                                             12.\n\n                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               But... sometimes there's a higher\n               patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,\n               change is hard. It's hard on Katie.\n               But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.\n               Life is change. This is good. We\n               were all blocked up, Katie and me.\n               This is, this is a blessing in\n               disguise. I'll go into training, you\n               know. Lay off the sauce. Like you\n               did. You managed to do it. Finally.\n               And then I can concentrate on, you\n               know. New beginning. And this'll all\n               have been for the best. Don't you\n               think Dad?\n\n     The old man stares out into the wind.\n\n     Osbourne sniffles.\n\n                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... Cold.\n\n     He taps the old man on the knee and rises.\n\n                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... I guess we should head back.\n\n\n10   EXT.

LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                          11\n\n     THE MAN\n\n     White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-\n     book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,\n     suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is\n     Bogus Terikhian.\n\n                          TERIKHIAN\n               ... I know this kind of man.    We've\n               seen this.\n\n                                                        13.\n\n\nWider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the\ntable, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an\nassistant.\n\n                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)\n             ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man\n             take advantage of you. And he will.\n             He will.\n\n                         KATIE\n             Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----\n             he says----he's trying to pull himself\n             together, but...\n\n                       TERIKHIAN\n             Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you\n             you should try to salvage things. And\n             you should. People turn themselves\n             around. Not unheard-of. But. You----\n             you haven't broached the possibility\n             of divorce yet?\n\n                         KATIE\n             No.\n\n                       TERIKHIAN\n             Well that's good.   Because first you\n             should get all his financials. Before\n             he's forewarned. Because here's a\n             man, here's a man, practiced in\n             deceit, this is almost, you could say\n             it's his job, practiced at hiding\n             things, and there is no reason, it is\n             not improper, there is no reason for\n             you not to get a picture of the\n             household finances. Paper files,\n             computer files, whatever----this is your\n             prerogative. You can be a spy too,\n             madam. Do this before you put him on\n             alert. Before the turtle can draw in\n             his head and his, uh...\n\nHe waggles his hands, groping for the word.\n\n                         TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)\n             ...

COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12\n\n     Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over\n     pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-\n     flung, like Marat in his bathtub.\n\n     A long still beat.   A clock ticks.\n\n     Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a\n     microcassette recorder.\n\n                         OSBOURNE\n               We were young and committed and there\n               was nothing we couldn't do. We\n               thought of the Agency less as... less\n               as...\n\n     The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and\n     wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.\n\n     He suddenly raises the microcassette again.\n\n                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)\n               ... The principles of George Kennan----a\n               personal hero of mine----were what\n               animated us. In fact they were what\n               had originally inspired me to enter\n               government service.

He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that\n     juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.\n\n     The phone is louder here.\n\n\n14   INT.

The\n     ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The\n     answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:\n\n                                                                 15.\n\n\n                          MACHINE\n                You have reached The Cox Group...\n\n     Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered\n     feet toward the phone.\n\n                          MACHINE (CONT'D)\n                ...

Mild chuckle from\n     Osbourne in the foreground.\n\n\n16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16\n\n     Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette\n     recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and\n     then stops, and looks off.\n\n     The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate\n     clock face Two or three minutes to five.\n\n     Osbourne stares for a long beat.\n\n\n17   INT.

He looks at Linda, puzzled and a\n     little alarmed. He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and\n     hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude.\n\n\n34   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     34\n\n     Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.\n\n     Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old\n     woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a\n     newspaper.\n\n     She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from\n     the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped\n     glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs.\n\n                            LINDA\n               Alan?\n\n                         MAN (ALAN)\n               Are you, uh... Linda?\n\n\n35   EXT.

RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           37\n\n     The couple sit across from each other at a small table. They\n     pick at their food.\n\n\n38   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT                            38\n\n     The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly\n     comforter. Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes\n     asthmatically.\n\n\n39   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER                            39\n\n     Alan is snoring. After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on\n     a robe. She bends down near the bed and picks something up\n     out of Alan's trousers.\n\n\n40   INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  40\n\n     She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and\n     opens Alan's wallet. A Discover card, driver's license, a\n     condom. A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish.\n\n     She unfolds a piece of notepaper.    Written in a feminine hand\n     in pencil:\n\n     Please pick up:\n         Plunge\n         Honey Nut Cheerios.\n\n                         LINDA\n               Oh for Pete's sake!\n\n     She catches herself, looks around.\n\n     The snoring, off, continues.\n\n     She looks out the window.\n\n     The lights of the freeway twinkle.\n\n                                                                 28.\n\n\n41   INT. YACHT - NIGHT                                                41\n\n     We are in the bedroom.   The boat rides gently at anchor.\n\n     Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.   Both stare at a point\n     in space.\n\n     After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of\n     water against hull:\n\n                           HARRY\n               ... and then, you know, you grow up.\n               I guess that's what's happened with\n               me. You just... people change. We\n               married when I was, what, in my mid-\n               twenties. A kid. We were kids.\n               Twenties. You think it's forever.\n               Then, you know, you're older----you\n               begin to feel your mortality, you\n               start to think, well, there's no more\n               time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You\n               go, I'm not that person. The choices\n               you made, you can't, just through\n               inertia----\n\n                         KATIE\n               I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.\n\n     Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.   After\n     more sloshing:\n\n                         HARRY\n               ... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean,\n               frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I\n               guess that's what I should be thinking\n               about too. With Sandy.\n\n                         KATIE\n               That's what you were just saying.\n\n                         HARRY\n               Yes! Absolutely! And you should be\n               getting rid of that bozo.  No\n               question about that. I agree.\n\n                         KATIE\n               So if I were divorced----\n\n                         HARRY\n               Well yes, if you were uh, you know,\n               yes. Yes, I should settle things.\n               With Sandy. Because of you and me.\n               It just takes, courage, you know. To\n               inflict that pain. Scary stuff.\n                         (MORE)\n\n                                                             29.\n\n                         HARRY (CONT'D)\n               Scary stuff. You're a brave lady.\n               Well, of course, it would be easier\n               for you.\n\n                         KATIE\n               Why's that? I don't see that.\n\n                         HARRY\n                   (chuckling)\n               Well you know, because he's such a\n               dope.\n                   (sobers)\n               But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A\n               very special lady.\n\n                         KATIE\n               She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.\n\n                         HARRY\n               Well that's... a little----\n\n                          KATIE\n               You and I should sort things out.\n               I've told you that this is not just\n               frivolity.\n\n                         HARRY\n               No, that's understood.   You've been\n               very straight.\n\n                         KATIE\n               I thought I was loud and clear.\n\n                         HARRY\n               Absolutely. Not just fun and games.\n\n     Awkward beat.   The sloshing of waves.   Harry nods.\n\n                         HARRY (CONT'D)\n               ... Absolutely.\n\n\n42   INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY                                         42\n\n     Harry Pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf.\n     He sights down it, examines the gauge, hefts it.\n\n     He slides it back in and pulls a length, wider gauge, from\n     the shelf below.\n\n                                                              30.\n\n\n43   EXT.

Standing in the\n     cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one\n     hand as he pushes.\n\n\n44   INT. LINDA LITZKE'S CUBICLE - DAY                                 44\n\n     Linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed\n     to one ear.\n\n                         LINDA\n               English!... Agent!... Agent!...\n\n     After a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and\n     cradles the handset. From the speaker we hear:\n\n                           RECORDED VOICE\n               ----important to us. Please stay on the\n               line for the next available agent.\n\n     Music.\n\n     Linda listens for a moment, then abruptly lifts the handset\n     and slams it back down.\n\n\n45   INT.

On its forward arc a dildo\n     emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled\n     toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its\n     entrance.\n\n     A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo\n     rhythmically bobbing up and down.\n\n     At length:\n\n                              LINDA\n                  Omygod!\n\n     Another couple of cycles.\n\n                            LINDA (CONT'D)\n                  ...

Rain.\n\n     The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the\n     front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark.

Katie Cox emerges from\n     the driver's side.\n\n     Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car\n     across the street.\n\n     Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a\n     brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he\n     follows Katie up the walk.\n\n     It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,\n     but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself\n     in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back\n     in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.\n\n     The door closes.\n\n     Chad relaxes, straightens up.   A beat.   He looks idly around.\n     He notices:\n\n     Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further\n     up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become\n     visible over the driver's headrest.\n\n     Chad looks, puzzled.\n\n\n94   INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER                         94\n\n     Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when\n     a noise brings his look around:\n\n                                                               74.\n\n\n     The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a\n     change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.\n\n     They get into her car.   It pulls out.\n\n     Chad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his\n     door but pauses, seeing:\n\n     The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it\n     now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars\n     disappear.\n\n     Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the\n     townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other\n     side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,\n     smoking.\n\n     Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-\n     level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the\n     caging on the door. He looks up the fa\u00e7ade of the house.\n\n\n95   INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT.

Chad checks out the\n      windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It\n      has a large window.\n\n\n98    INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK WINDOW - DAY                           98\n\n      We can see Chad's form outside the door.   Its pane is tapped\n      once... twice... it breaks.\n\n\n99    EXT.

COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         104\n\n      Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly\n      around, heading toward the front door when a shape\n      materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.\n\n      Chad freezes.\n\n      There is scraping at the lock.\n\n      Chad quickly mounts the stairs.\n\n\n105   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                          105\n\n      Chad freezes, listening.\n\n      The downstairs door swings open, shut.\n\n      Footsteps.\n\n      A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open\n      door.\n\n\n106   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                               106\n\n      Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the\n      way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.\n\n      His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.    In the middle of the\n      bed, a wedge-cushion.\n\n                                                           77.\n\n\nBeyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and\nstairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges\nback a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks\ndown one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back\nand seems to relax.\n\nHarry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps\nout of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master\nbedroom. He leaves the door open.\n\nChad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but\nstops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the\ncurtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He\nrinses off, humming \"Born Free,\" and walks into the\nforeground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress\npants that was draped across a bureau.\n\nChad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry\nstops, just outside the cracked door.\n\nThrough the crack we see only the white of his shirt.\nAbruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room\nand bends to pick something off the floor.\n\nChad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again\nas Harry approaches.\n\nChad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown\npinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.\n\nThe closet door is thrown open.\n\n                     CHAD\n          Nuhhh!\n\n                    HARRY\n          AHHHHHHHHHH!\n\nHarry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder\nholster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.\n\nThe gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,\nHarry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and\ndrops the weapon.\n\nHe crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles\noff on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down\nthe stairs.\n\n                                                                78.\n\n\n107   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY                     107\n\n      He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back\n      up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that\n      he can listen.\n\n      A long silence.\n\n                                HARRY\n                   ...

COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY                                109\n\n      Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the\n      stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.\n\n                                HARRY\n                   ... Hello?\n\n\n110   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                         110\n\n      Harry tops the stairs.       He pauses, looking at:\n\n      The bedroom door, ajar.\n\n      Inside, his gun lies on the floor.\n\n      Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.\n\n      He pauses at the cracked door.      Suddenly:\n\n                                HARRY\n                   Hungh!\n\n      He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops\n      it, dropping the knife.\n\n      He stands and spins, panting.\n\n      His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude\n      into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his\n      back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.\n\n                                                             79.\n\n\nHarry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he\nexperimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.\n\nHarry nudges the door.\n\n                       HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Hello?\n\nIt creaks fully open.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod. Omygod.\n\nChad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod who are you. You fucker.\n          Omygod.\n\nHe gingerly crouches down.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... You fucker...\n\nHe tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit\npockets.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Omygod, my god...

What the fuck...\n\nHe leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason\nfeeling obliged to return the wallet.\n\nAs he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside\npocket he notices:\n\nThe suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled\nfringe.\n\n                    HARRY (CONT'D)\n          ... Oh my fuck...\n\nHe straightens up again.\n\n                                                              80.\n\n\n                          HARRY (CONT'D)\n                ...

CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112\n\n      We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame\n      and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer\n      DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.\n\n      He looks up.\n\n                            PALMER\n                Olson.

CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115\n\n      Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A\n      silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned\n      back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the\n      desktop.\n\n                            MAN\n                Palmer.

A desktop nameplate\nidentifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.\n\nPalmer hands a folder across, grimacing.\n\n                    PALMER (CONT'D)\n          ...

The people you use.\n\n      A long beat.\n\n                                                                 96.\n\n\n                          SANDY\n                You've written a children's book?\n\n                            OSBOURNE\n                No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but\n                ----doesn't your company have an adult\n                arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's\n                arm?

His drink is in his\n      other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.\n\n      The living room is empty.\n\n      Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the\n      kitchen.\n\n      Empty.\n\n      He proceeds to the basement door.\n\n\n146   INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT.

Linda stops.\n\n      A rhythmic thudding sound.    It almost makes her car vibrate.\n\n                                                               114.\n\n\n      She looks around.   She rolls down her window, sticks her head\n      out, looks up.\n\n      A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-\n      clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking\n      down.\n\n      Linda draws her head back in.\n\n                           LINDA\n                 Oh for Pete's sake.\n\n\n147   INT.
