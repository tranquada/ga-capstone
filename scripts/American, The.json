He sips from a thick cut crystal glass of whiskey.\r\n\r\n    The impressive US Army Special Forces crest tattooed on the\r\n    shoulder of his bare torso is at odds with JACK's quiet\r\n    manner and the distinguished silver that flecks his hair and\r\n    stubble. JACK is no longer young.\r\n\r\n    A creak behind him and his eyes flick over his left shoulder.\r\n\r\n    INGRID (34) is naked. With an intimate familiarity she kisses\r\n    JACK on the top of his head, sits close behind him and wraps\r\n    her arms around her lover, linking her slender hands across\r\n    his upper chest.\r\n\r\n    Her head resting on his shoulder, her face beside his, INGRID\r\n    and JACK watch the fire together in easy silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   EXT.

They are fresh-faced and warm from bed.\r\n\r\n    They head towards a vast and frozen lake.\r\n\r\n    JACK senses something in the woods.\r\n\r\n    Beneath the Conifers: impenetrable darkness.\r\n\r\n    JACK looks around.\r\n\r\n    Thick snow blankets the world and muffles any sound. There is\r\n    not the slightest breeze.\r\n\r\n                          INGRID\r\n                What are you looking for?\r\n\r\n    Her Swedish accent is sing-song.\r\n                                                           2.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JACK\r\n              Nothing.\r\n\r\n    His anxiety is evident.\r\n\r\n    INGRID laughs out loud.\r\n\r\n                        INGRID\r\n              There are no wolves in the woods so\r\n              close to the city.\r\n\r\n    JACK smiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   EXT.

The\r\n    man's prints are heading in the opposite direction, towards\r\n    the shoreline.\r\n\r\n    JACK spins around in the direction they've just come from.\r\n\r\n    No one.\r\n                                                        3.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, about ten metres inland from the edge of the lake, a\r\nlow branch dips and a thick rug of snow falls from the\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nJACK grabs INGRID, yanks her towards the cover of the\r\nlakeside trees and pushes her down into the snow.\r\n\r\nShe grunts, winded. He lies besides her.\r\n\r\nWe hear the CRACK of a bullet- so quiet it might be a bough\r\nsnapping under the weight of winter.\r\n\r\nIt isn't.\r\n\r\nJACK pulls a WALTHER PPK/S semi-automatic handgun from the\r\npocket of his Parka.\r\n\r\nCocks it.\r\n\r\nWaits.\r\n\r\nThen bobs up and down once.\r\n\r\nThere's another CRACK from the trees.\r\n\r\nJACK pinpoints the spot from the drift of BLUE SMOKE, almost\r\ninvisible in the winter air.\r\n\r\nThere's someone in the shadows.\r\n\r\nHe rubs snow into his woollen hat, edges up until he can just\r\nsee over the snow and pumps THREE SHOTS into the dusk under\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nWe hear a muttering groan and then a sliding sound, as if\r\nJACK has just shot a tobogganist.\r\n\r\nMore snow slides off the trees.\r\n\r\nJACK waits.\r\n\r\nINGRID gathers her breath but loses her wits:\r\n\r\n                      INGRID\r\n            You have a gun.\r\n\r\nJACK keeps his eyes fixed on the trees.\r\n\r\n                      INGRID\r\n            You have a gun! How do you have a\r\n            gun? Why should you carry such a\r\n            weapon?\r\n\r\nJACK looks at her briefly but makes no reply.\r\n\r\nShe is busy thinking.\r\n\r\nSo is he.\r\n                                                         4.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INGRID\r\n          Jack?\r\n\r\nHe stands up slowly and walks inland towards the corpse that\r\nis just visible now in the shadows beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nINGRID follows, frightened.\r\n\r\nThe MAN is slouched forwards in a drift of snow, his body\r\ncushioned in white softness.\r\n\r\nJACK kicks the sole of his boot. He's dead.\r\n\r\n                    INGRID\r\n          Jack talk to me!\r\n\r\nJACK grabs his collar and turns him over.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't recognise him.\r\n\r\nJACK fumbles at his buttons and rummages in his clothing.\r\n\r\nIn his breast pocket he finds a MILITARY IDENTITY PASS.\r\n\r\n                       INGRID\r\n          Who is he?\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n          A hunter.\r\n\r\n                    INGRID\r\n          He's not dressed like a hunter. Why\r\n          is he alone? Hunters always go in\r\n          pairs. For safety.\r\n\r\nSwiftly, JACK removes the bolt from the man's rifle and\r\nthrows it far into the trees.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Go for help. Call the police.\r\n\r\nINGRID sets off, stumbling up the track they have made\r\nthrough the snow.\r\n\r\nJACK shoots her just once, in the nape of her neck.\r\n\r\nShe twitches in the snow, her blood staining the white fur of\r\nher coat collar.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance, INGRID looks like a shot Snow-hair.\r\n\r\nJACK approaches her.\r\n\r\nAnd steps over her, trying not to look down.\r\n\r\nTrying not to look back.\r\n                                                            5.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   EXT. DACHA- MORNING                                          5\r\n\r\n    Outside the dacha is another MAN, standing by a black\r\n    Mercedes-Benz sedan.\r\n\r\n    The second hunter.\r\n\r\n    He is holding an automatic pistol but he's not on alert.\r\n\r\n    JACK fells him easily with a bullet in the ear.\r\n\r\n    He removes the clip from his WALTHER and reloads it.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   INT. DACHA- MORNING                                          6\r\n\r\n    JACK packs a few belongings in a holdall.\r\n\r\n\r\n7   EXT. DACHA- MORNING                                          7\r\n\r\n    JACK smashes the CB radio in the Mercedes and removes the\r\n    distributor cap from the engine, burying it deep in the snow.\r\n\r\n    Then he gets into the Saab.\r\n\r\n    And drives off.\r\n\r\n\r\n8   TITLES                                                       8\r\n\r\n    Over images of: JACK on a ferry to Gotland; changing clothes\r\n    and vessels for Ystad; travelling by road to Trelleborg;\r\n    catching the night crossing to Travemunde; driving to Hamburg\r\n    and from Hamburg catching a train to...\r\n\r\n\r\n9   EXT. ROME- DAY                                               9\r\n\r\n    At a fast food stand not far from the central train station,\r\n    a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog.\r\n\r\n    It is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists,\r\n    LARRY stands out as an American.\r\n\r\n    JACK does not.\r\n\r\n                        JACK\r\n              Blending in?\r\n\r\n    LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the\r\n    centre of attention.\r\n\r\n                        LARRY\r\n              Jack.

His\r\n     demeanour is sprightly.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               But there were complications.\r\n\r\n     Then LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man\r\n     who likes to get his hands dirty.\r\n\r\n     JACK walks beside him.\r\n\r\n     Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Collateral damage. Two shooters.\r\n               Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl.\r\n\r\n     LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look\r\n     at JACK.\r\n\r\n     JACK is tired.\r\n\r\n                         LARRY\r\n               There's a bar across the street:\r\n               the L'Aquila.

He looks exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n11   INT. BAR- DAY                                                11\r\n\r\n     JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of\r\n     the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door\r\n     to the bathrooms.\r\n\r\n     He lights a cigarette.\r\n\r\n     LARRY comes in and sits opposite him.\r\n\r\n                         LARRY\r\n                   (genuinely shocked)\r\n               You started smoking again?\r\n\r\n     JACK exhales.\r\n\r\n                           JACK\r\n               Guess so.\r\n                                                         7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LARRY\r\n          Since when?\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n          Since now.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table.\r\n\r\n                       WAITER\r\n          Cafe?\r\n\r\n                       LARRY\r\n          Due.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER disappears.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\nLARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table.\r\n\r\n                    LARRY\r\n          Stockholm account.

You\r\n          won't see `em coming, not in a big\r\n          city. But you can't go far, either.\r\n          If the gentlemen whose accounts you\r\n          closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo,\r\n          Simenov- any of the first division-\r\n          you have four or five hours at most\r\n          before every airport, train\r\n          station, bus stop, toll booth and\r\n          ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje\r\n          is under surveillance.\r\n\r\nJACK smokes.\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n          So.\r\n\r\nNot a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly\r\nwhat he's talking about.

You find a hole- somewhere\r\n               nearby- and you crawl into it and\r\n               you stay put until I say it's safe\r\n               to come out.\r\n\r\n     JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face.\r\n\r\n                         LARRY\r\n               Turn right outside the bar then\r\n               second left. Via Spinetti. You'll\r\n               find a silver Citroen C2 with\r\n               Chieti plates. Check the glove box\r\n               and follow the map.

CAR- CONTINUOUS                                         16\r\n\r\n     JACK looks at the sign.\r\n\r\n     He looks up at the silent town, at the vast stone ramparts.\r\n\r\n     An OLD MAN comes out of a crooked medieval doorway, stares at\r\n     JACK and disappears into another building.\r\n\r\n     JACK looks at the dead sockets of the windows, random beneath\r\n     the rotting patchwork of rooves.\r\n\r\n     A DOG barks. The WIND hisses. The atmosphere is deathly.\r\n\r\n     JACK makes a decision.\r\n\r\n     And drives away.\r\n\r\n\r\n17   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  17\r\n\r\n     We see JACK'S CAR heading away from CASTELVECCHIO.\r\n                                                          10.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The CAR crosses a spectacular VIADUCT that spans a deep\r\n     RAVINE.\r\n\r\n     The driver's window opens.\r\n\r\n     A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag is thrown out.\r\n\r\n     It drops hundreds of feet down the ravine.\r\n\r\n                                                    FADE OUT.\r\n\r\n     FADE IN:\r\n\r\n\r\n18   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, MAIN SQUARE- DAY                      18\r\n\r\n     CASTEL DEL MONTE is a well preserved, happy looking little\r\n     mediaeval town with a handful of tourists.\r\n\r\n     A chunk of time has passed.\r\n\r\n     JACK is sitting on a table outside a small BAR wearing dark\r\n     glasses, sipping a coffee and reading a guide book. He looks\r\n     like a tastefully dressed, well educated American tourist. He\r\n     blends in. And no one pays him much attention as he finishes\r\n     his coffee, pays his bill, gets up and leaves.\r\n\r\n     We follow JACK as he passes the parapet of the town ramparts\r\n     and looks across the spectacular valley...\r\n\r\n     ...towards the deserted CASTELVECCHIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n19   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  19\r\n\r\n     At a leisurely pace, JACK passes a row of municipal rubbish\r\n     bins just inside the fortified gates to the old town.\r\n\r\n     Hidden well behind the bins we catch sight of JACK's parked\r\n     CAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n20   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      20\r\n\r\n     We're right in the heart of the mediaeval old town: like the\r\n     stronghold at the centre of a castle.\r\n\r\n     JACK approaches a small family run bed and breakfast just off\r\n     the main square.\r\n\r\n     The sign reads: \"PENSIONE ABRUZZO\".\r\n\r\n\r\n21   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- DAY                                   21\r\n\r\n     The internal courtyard is refreshingly cool.\r\n                                                          11.\r\n\r\n\r\n     In the centre of the courtyard is a FOUNTAIN made of marble\r\n     shot through with black veins.\r\n\r\n     In the fountain stands an alabaster STATUE OF A GIRL. She's\r\n     wearing a toga and holding a clam shell from which the water\r\n     falls. The water is delivered by a two and quarter millimetre\r\n     diameter pipe made of bronze.\r\n\r\n     As JACK crosses the courtyard he glances at the STATUE.\r\n\r\n     He finds it hard to tear his eyes away.\r\n\r\n\r\n22   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      22\r\n\r\n     A toothbrush in the glass by the sink.\r\n\r\n     The guidebook on the bedside table.\r\n\r\n     Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely\r\n     out of his holdall for some time.\r\n\r\n     From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid\r\n     BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS.\r\n\r\n     Through his casement window he has good view of\r\n     CASTELVECCHIO.\r\n\r\n     He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical.\r\n     This is a routine assessment.\r\n\r\n     JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old\r\n     man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n23   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                    23\r\n\r\n     JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide\r\n     awake.\r\n\r\n     Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame...\r\n\r\n     ...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun.\r\n\r\n\r\n24   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  24\r\n\r\n     Blinding SUN fills frame.\r\n\r\n     JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval\r\n     architecture, the square, the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n25   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           25\r\n\r\n     The CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black,\r\n     surveys the world below him:\r\n                                                            12.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Locals are going about their business, a few scattered\r\n     tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches\r\n     the PRIEST's attention.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only\r\n     tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like\r\n     methodology with which JACK photographs the little town...\r\n\r\n\r\n26   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, ALLEYWAY- DAY                         26\r\n\r\n     JACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow\r\n     alleyways.\r\n\r\n     The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind\r\n     corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches,\r\n     criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by\r\n     outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell-\r\n     depending on how dangerous the prey.\r\n\r\n     JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a\r\n     crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each\r\n     alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of\r\n     steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway.\r\n\r\n     From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game\r\n     show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of\r\n     a barking dog.\r\n\r\n     No dog is visible.\r\n\r\n     Curious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came.\r\n\r\n     The sound of barking gets louder.\r\n\r\n     On his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY.\r\n\r\n     The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big\r\n     enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the\r\n     `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence\r\n     of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls.\r\n     The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap\r\n     between them very, very difficult to spot.\r\n\r\n     JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY.\r\n\r\n     Inside is a courtyard.\r\n\r\n\r\n27   INT. COURTYARD- DAY                                          27\r\n\r\n     Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms.\r\n\r\n     A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash\r\n     keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK.\r\n\r\n     JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and\r\n     fury.\r\n                                                          13.\r\n\r\n\r\n28   EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY                                    28\r\n\r\n     JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into\r\n     the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin\r\n     air.\r\n\r\n     He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS:\r\n\r\n     -first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY\r\n\r\n     -and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA.\r\n\r\n     Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the\r\n     alleyway and drives towards him.\r\n\r\n     Casually, JACK continues walking.\r\n\r\n     The DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a\r\n     black crash helmet with a tinted visor.\r\n\r\n     JACK picks up his pace.\r\n\r\n     The DUCATI is ten metres away.\r\n\r\n     JACK's right hand moves towards his pocket.\r\n\r\n     Five metres.\r\n\r\n     JACK's hand goes in his pocket.\r\n\r\n     Two metres.\r\n\r\n     BANG!\r\n\r\n     JACK drops to his knees.\r\n\r\n     BANG!\r\n\r\n     The DUCATI backfires for a second time.\r\n\r\n     A pause.\r\n\r\n     Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace.\r\n\r\n     The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up\r\n     the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his\r\n     helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late\r\n     sixties.\r\n\r\n     He glances at JACK.\r\n\r\n     JACK stands.\r\n\r\n                          MAN ON DUCATI\r\n                Buon giorno!\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n                Buon giorno.\r\n                                                            14.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MAN ON DUCATI\r\n                  Da dove provenite?\r\n\r\n     For an instant, the directness of the question catches JACK\r\n     out.\r\n\r\n                             JACK\r\n                  America.\r\n\r\n                            MAN ON DUCATI\r\n                  Ah!

Il Americano.\r\n\r\n     JACK's pronunciation is good but his grammar is a bit rusty.\r\n     Perhaps he's playing up on this. It suits the role of\r\n     American tourist.\r\n\r\n     The MAN laughs enthusiastically emphasizing the correct\r\n     grammar:\r\n\r\n                            MAN ON DUCATI\r\n                  L'Americano ! L'Americano!\r\n\r\n     A WOMAN'S VOICE comes from within the house- loud and angry-\r\n     distracting the MAN ON THE DUCATI, who screams back\r\n     passionately, enters his front door, and shuts it behind him\r\n     with a hearty slam.\r\n\r\n     JACK walks on.\r\n\r\n\r\n29   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                      29\r\n\r\n     JACK puts some coins in a CIGARETTE MACHINE.\r\n\r\n     The MACHINE takes his money but won't dispense his\r\n     cigarettes.\r\n\r\n     He hits the refund button but nothing happens.\r\n\r\n     JACK checks the time.\r\n\r\n     And thumps the machine hard.\r\n\r\n     Footsteps.\r\n\r\n     JACK adjusts his position and checks the time again.\r\n\r\n                            VOICE (O.S.)\r\n                  Can I help you?\r\n\r\n     The man behind him is reflected in the surface of JACK's\r\n     battered ROLEX.\r\n\r\n                            JACK\r\n                  I'm no good with machines.\r\n                                                     15.\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK turns, smiling politely.\r\n\r\nThe PRIEST smiles back.\r\n\r\nHe is dressed in an ill-fitting, un-stylish black suit, a\r\nblack silk stock and a deep Roman collar fraying at the edge.\r\nHis name is FATHER BENEDETTO. He is older than JACK.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You are American.\r\n\r\nThis is stated matter-of-factly: like a man practising\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Si.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You speak Italian?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Poco.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Va bene!

FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR                    31\r\n\r\n     The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook\r\n     the hilltop town.\r\n\r\n     JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt.\r\n\r\n     He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of\r\n     a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet\r\n     secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a\r\n     globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like\r\n     a honey bee hovering over a bloom.\r\n                                                     18.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Que siamo! The quality of the\r\n          brandy is good, the liquor is\r\n          smooth and the glass warmed by the\r\n          sun.\r\n\r\nHe pronounces warmed \"war-med\". His English is sophisticated\r\nbut quaint, like an out-of-date book.\r\n\r\nJACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a\r\nconnoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of\r\na Presidential beverage.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n              (in ENGLISH)\r\n          The only good thing to come from\r\n          the Francesi, everything else...\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO grimaces.\r\n\r\n                     FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          The French are... pezzi di merda.\r\n          This is not an American discovery.\r\n          Italians have known this for\r\n          centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome\r\n          called France the province of Gaul,\r\n          they were just the same. Arrogant\r\n          sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy\r\n          and their wine effeminate. Only\r\n          their brandy is worthy of any\r\n          attention.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n              (in ENGLISH)\r\n          Forgive me. I speak too fast. You\r\n          study our history?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          No.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You come to Italy to make a guide\r\n          book and you don't care about\r\n          history?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I take pictures, father.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Of course. You are American. You\r\n          think you can escape history. You\r\n          live for the present.\r\n                                                            19.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A beat.\r\n\r\n     JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but\r\n     humane.\r\n\r\n     JACK sips his brandy.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               I try to, father.\r\n\r\n\r\n32   EXT. L'AQUILA- EVENING                                       32\r\n\r\n     Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the\r\n     capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to\r\n     Castel del Monte and Castelveccio.\r\n\r\n     Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated,\r\n     nestled high up in the Appenine mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n33   EXT. L'AQUILA, SHOPPING STREET- EVENING                      33\r\n\r\n     JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of\r\n     groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street.\r\n\r\n\r\n34   EXT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING                        34\r\n\r\n     JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small,\r\n     inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its\r\n     graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of\r\n     what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block.\r\n\r\n     Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year-\r\n     old Italian girl.\r\n\r\n     CLARA.\r\n\r\n     She catches JACK's eye.\r\n\r\n     He walks on.\r\n\r\n\r\n35   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 35\r\n\r\n     The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple,\r\n     pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts.\r\n\r\n     On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of\r\n     PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories:\r\n\r\n           1. Street plan\r\n\r\n           2. Exit routes/car\r\n\r\n           3.

PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      36\r\n\r\n     JACK completes his morning exercises then showers and\r\n     dresses. His manner is precise and methodical. Only a man who\r\n     has lived alone for many years can live like this.\r\n\r\n     When his preparations are complete, he picks up his\r\n     BINOCULARS and studies the nearby town of CASTELVECCHIO\r\n     through his medieval casement window.\r\n\r\n\r\n37   EXT. CASTELVECCIO, JACK'S POV- CONTINUOUS                    37\r\n\r\n     The dead town has come to life!\r\n\r\n     There's a MARKET in progress. The central piazza is a hive of\r\n     activity. Food, local produce, clothes and cheap CD stalls.\r\n\r\n     The market has attracted TOURISTS. Standing by a phone box\r\n     not far from a cheese stall is an attractive WOMAN in dark\r\n     glasses. She's rifling through her handbag, searching for\r\n     something. Under her right arm is a rolled up copy of Il\r\n     Messaggero.\r\n\r\n     We notice the front page of the Italian daily newspaper has\r\n     been folded in half.\r\n\r\n\r\n38   INT.

As she\r\n     replaces the phone in her handbag, she knocks the newspaper\r\n     off her table.\r\n\r\n     JACK picks it up.\r\n\r\n                            WOMAN\r\n                  Grazie.\r\n\r\n                            JACK\r\n                  Prego.

CASTELVECCHIO, TOWN SQUARE, CAFE- DAY                    45\r\n\r\n     JACK is sitting in the CAFE where he met Mathilde.\r\n\r\n     He is watching the entrance to the local POST OFFICE.\r\n\r\n     He studies his WATCH.\r\n\r\n     It's been an hour and no one has come or gone from the tiny\r\n     rural branch of the Poste Italiane.\r\n\r\n     JACK puts the correct amount of change on the table and gets\r\n     up...\r\n\r\n\r\n46   INT. CASTELVECCHIO, POST OFFICE- DAY                          46\r\n\r\n     The shop is small and dusty.\r\n\r\n     So is the POSTMASTER.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Buon giorno.\r\n\r\n     The POSTMASTER grunts his reply, jutting his chin.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Il fermo posta?\r\n\r\n     The POSTMASTER turns to a rack of pigeonholes behind a sack\r\n     of mail hanging in a metal frame like an old person's walking\r\n     aid. From one pigeonhole he draws a bundle of general\r\n     delivery envelopes held together by an elastic band. Some\r\n     have been there for weeks. Months even.\r\n\r\n                         POSTMASTER\r\n               Nome?\r\n\r\n     A beat.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Clarke.\r\n\r\n     Deftly, like a teller counting through a thick wad of\r\n     banknotes he flicks through the mail with thin, wasted\r\n     fingers.\r\n                                                            27.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               POSTMASTER\r\n                  Clarky?\r\n\r\n                            JACK\r\n                  Clarke.

The POSTMASTER clicks again,\r\n     disappearing behind the rack of pigeon holes...\r\n\r\n                            POSTMASTER\r\n                  Clarky, Clarky, Clarky. Ecco.\r\n\r\n     ...and reappearing with a PACKAGE.\r\n\r\n     The PACKAGE is from an Italian PHOTOGRAPHIC SUPPLIERS.\r\n\r\n                               JACK\r\n                  Grazie.\r\n\r\n                            POSTMASTER\r\n                  Identificazione.\r\n\r\n     JACK flicks his eyes downwards. He has already put his\r\n     PASSPORT on the counter.\r\n\r\n     The POSTMASTER scoops it up with bony fingers.\r\n\r\n     Looks from the picture to JACK.\r\n\r\n     JACK bears the scrutiny with a deadly straight face.\r\n\r\n\r\n47   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ARBRUZZO- EVENING            47\r\n\r\n     JACK unwraps the PACKAGE.\r\n\r\n     He removes:\r\n\r\n     -film\r\n\r\n     -photographic paper\r\n\r\n     -development fluids\r\n\r\n     -fixing solutions\r\n\r\n     Then:\r\n\r\n     -a solid, monolythic rectangular receiver made out of a\r\n     single piece of lightweight alloy.\r\n\r\n     -a bolt assembly.\r\n\r\n     -a barrel.\r\n                                                          28.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Only with this final piece is the puzzle complete.\r\n\r\n     Laid out on the floor is a SOCIMI 821 SUB-MACHINE GUN.\r\n\r\n     Without touching it, JACK studies the weapon like a\r\n     connoisseur looking at the hue of a wine. In particular he\r\n     notices that the SERIAL NUMBER has been scratched off.\r\n\r\n     Then he moves slowly, assembling the weapon with precision\r\n     engineered expertise:\r\n\r\n     -inserting the barrel into the front of the receiver and\r\n     securing it with the nut,\r\n\r\n     -opening the sidefolding tubular stock and engaging the\r\n     buttpad,\r\n\r\n     -snuggling the buttpad to his shoulder,\r\n\r\n     -looking down the barrel,\r\n\r\n     -and slowly squeezing back the finger-grooved TRIGGER as we\r\n\r\n                                                  SMASH CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n48   INT.

CASTEL DEL MONTE, PAY PHONE- DAY                        49\r\n\r\n     JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness.\r\n                                                             29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Your source in Rome.\r\n\r\n                         LARRY (V.O.)\r\n               Clean bill of health and no OC.\r\n               This was a straight favour with a\r\n               dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got\r\n               a second cousin in NOCS on the\r\n               graft who filched him the Socimi.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               I hope you paid below the odds. The\r\n               more you pay them the more cops\r\n               gossip in the locker room.\r\n\r\n                         LARRY (V.O.)\r\n               No one's gossiping, Jack.\r\n\r\n     JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other\r\n     side of the square.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n50   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                         50\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler.\r\n\r\n     This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is\r\n     a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck.\r\n\r\n     In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES.\r\n\r\n     The API is turning over but it won't start.\r\n\r\n     The bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine.\r\n\r\n     He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key\r\n     again.\r\n\r\n     This time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and\r\n     cheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n51   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      51\r\n\r\n     Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with\r\n     polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique\r\n     sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the\r\n     life of Our Lord.\r\n\r\n     The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black\r\n     edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like\r\n     the columns of cathedrals.\r\n                                                             30.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like\r\n     old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n     performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat,\r\n     dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables.\r\n\r\n     He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash.\r\n\r\n     JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n     potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own\r\n     wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming.\r\n\r\n\r\n52   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      52\r\n\r\n     JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in\r\n     silence.\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so\r\n     absorbed.\r\n\r\n     As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to\r\n     help himself from the ancient tureen.\r\n\r\n     Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again.\r\n\r\n     JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with\r\n     his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid-\r\n     twenties. FABIO.\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered\r\n     dish issuing steam into his face.\r\n\r\n     He notices JACK's eye-line.\r\n\r\n                         FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n               All the sheep in my flock are dear\r\n               to me, but some are dearer than\r\n               most. Especially those that have\r\n               strayed from the fold.\r\n\r\n     Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies:\r\n\r\n                         FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n               Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car\r\n               doctor'. But I suspect his practice\r\n               is not entirely sound. Ecco!\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish\r\n     revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce.\r\n\r\n                         FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n               Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of\r\n               orange juice, orange peel,\r\n               chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine\r\n               and... Come si dici in Inglese?\r\n               Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth.\r\n                                                        31.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and\r\npours white wine into fresh glasses.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Also: salsify in garlic butter.\r\n          Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms\r\n          with truffle.\r\n\r\nJACK helps himself to vegetables.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste.\r\n\r\nJACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine.\r\n\r\nThe two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Sinful.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO shrugs.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          The Holy Father eats better than\r\n          this.\r\n\r\nThe flash of a smile crosses the priest's face.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Have you ever wanted to be anything\r\n          other than a priest?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Have you ever wanted to be anything\r\n          other than a... come se dice in\r\n          Inglese...?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Photographer?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Photographer.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I do what I'm good at.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          I'm sure you have other talents.\r\n          You have the hands of a craftsman,\r\n          not an artist. You are good with\r\n          machines. Yet you told me just the\r\n          opposite when we first met.\r\n\r\nJACK hides his unease from the watchful priest.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Journalism cannot make you a rich\r\n          man.\r\n                                                          32.\r\n\r\n\r\n     FATHER BENEDETTO's eyes flick over the ROLEX.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               No.\r\n\r\n                         FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n               Perhaps you are rich already?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               I'm not a young man.

But if a man has God in\r\n               his vaults...\r\n\r\n     He looks searchingly at JACK.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               I don't think God is interested in\r\n               me.

COUNTRYSIDE- DAY                                        54\r\n\r\n     Just east of the old city walls a dirt track meanders\r\n     downhill through a series of small holdings, allotments and\r\n     scrap metal yards.\r\n\r\n     The CAR moves slowly. We can hear the scrape of trailing\r\n     metal.\r\n\r\n     JACK pulls up beside a high chain fence.\r\n\r\n     The DOGS on the other side start barking. This sets off other\r\n     dogs in other scrap yards.\r\n\r\n     JACK gets out of the car and approaches a makeshift hut\r\n     beside the fence. Before he's a metre from the door it opens\r\n     and a tough, well-built, unshaven Italian man in his mid-\r\n     twenties looks him up and down.\r\n\r\n     FABIO.\r\n\r\n                            JACK\r\n                  Sono un amico di Padre Benedetto.\r\n\r\n     Suspicion gives way suddenly to warmth:\r\n\r\n                            FABIO\r\n                  L'Americano?\r\n\r\n     JACK smiles politely.\r\n\r\n                            JACK\r\n                  Buon giorno.\r\n\r\n\r\n55   INT.

FABIO leads JACK inside.\r\n\r\n     At the back of the cluttered workshop is a blue ALFA ROMEO\r\n     being resprayed white. Beside it, one half of a LANCIA is\r\n     being welded to another.\r\n\r\n     JACK knows better than to stare.

PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                                 60\r\n\r\n     By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed\r\n     steel gear.\r\n\r\n     It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor\r\n     light.\r\n\r\n\r\n61   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  61\r\n\r\n     JACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making\r\n     his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark,\r\n     purposeful, alert.\r\n\r\n     The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops.\r\n     Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers.\r\n\r\n     His guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen\r\n     anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks\r\n     around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash\r\n     whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The\r\n     air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies.\r\n\r\n     JACK is transfixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n62   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                      62\r\n\r\n     JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in\r\n     the heat.\r\n\r\n     His original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks\r\n     the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of\r\n     the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars,\r\n     monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human\r\n     activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath\r\n     of mountain air.\r\n\r\n     And scrambles back down to the valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n63   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                              63\r\n\r\n     JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample\r\n     WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE.\r\n\r\n     JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a\r\n     patch of soft grass beside the water.\r\n                                                       37.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket,\r\nkneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces:\r\n\r\n-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a\r\nchilled bottle of Frascati\r\n\r\n-a loaf of course bread\r\n\r\n-50 gms of pecorino\r\n\r\n-100 gms of proscuitto\r\n\r\n-a small jar of black olives\r\n\r\n-an orange\r\n\r\n-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of\r\nthe SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.\r\n\r\nJACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX.\r\n\r\nIt takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the\r\nbastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND\r\nSUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS\r\ninto the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip,\r\nsnuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the\r\nrubber cup on the sight.\r\n\r\nHe's fast.\r\n\r\nCarefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS.\r\nAnd with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates\r\nuntil his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still.\r\n\r\nA beat...\r\n\r\n...as JACK holds his breath. Then squeezes the trigger.\r\n\r\nCHOOP!\r\n\r\nCHOOP!\r\n\r\nCHOOP!\r\n\r\nNot the conventional \"phut, phut, phut\" of a movie silencer,\r\nbut the genuine dampened sonic boom of a TAC 65 sound\r\nsuppressor.\r\n\r\nThrough the sight we see the water churn at four o'clock to\r\nthe REED CLUMP and four metres off.\r\n\r\nFrom the knapsack, JACK takes a watchmaker's steel-handled\r\nscrewdriver and adjusts the sight, then loads another ten\r\nrounds in the magazine.\r\n\r\nCHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!\r\n                                                          38.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The reeds are clipped, the bullets slapping into the bank\r\n     behind, mud spurting.\r\n\r\n     JACK adjusts again and reloads.\r\n\r\n     CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!\r\n\r\n     The reed clump is shot to shit.\r\n\r\n\r\n64   INT.

JACK's eyes are\r\n     sore and his fingers aching.\r\n\r\n     He sits on his bed with his hands on his knees, silent in the\r\n     dying light.\r\n\r\n\r\n65   INT. BROTHEL, VIA LAMPEDUSA- NIGHT                           65\r\n\r\n     We're in the living room of a small apartment. It's simply\r\n     and attractively furnished. There are 2 GIRLS: not obviously\r\n     hookers.\r\n\r\n     The FIRST GIRL is on her mobile phone. Every now and again\r\n     she glances at JACK. The SECOND GIRL approaches him for a\r\n     light.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               E Clara qui?\r\n               [Is Clara here?]\r\n\r\n                         SECOND GIRL\r\n               Non e stasera qui.\r\n               [She's not here tonight.]\r\n\r\n     She loops her arm through JACK's.\r\n                                                             39.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SECOND GIRL\r\n               Volete una bevanda?\r\n               [Would you like a drink?]\r\n\r\n     JACK shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Forse un altro tempo.\r\n               [Perhaps another time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n66   EXT.

BAR- DAY                                                 67\r\n\r\n     Crowded with locals. JACK orders a coffee.\r\n\r\n     Through the window he tries to keep an surreptitious eye on\r\n     the YOUNG MAN. But the darkness outside throws back\r\n     reflections of the bright neon-lit bar within.\r\n\r\n     One reflection catches our attention.\r\n\r\n     The Italian girl. CLARA.\r\n\r\n     She is drinking and laughing with friends, young Italians\r\n     like her. She catches sight of JACK.\r\n\r\n     He turns away.\r\n\r\n\r\n68   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- NIGHT                                  68\r\n\r\n     JACK comes out of the bar with his hand in his pocket.\r\n\r\n     No sign of the YOUNG MAN.\r\n                                                          40.\r\n\r\n\r\n     He slips down a side street.\r\n\r\n\r\n69   EXT. SIDE STREETS- NIGHT                                   69\r\n\r\n     JACK slips from one side street to another taking full\r\n     advantage of short-cuts, alleyways and crumbling walls. His\r\n     route is circuitous. It betrays a perfect knowledge of the\r\n     maze-like back streets of the town.\r\n\r\n     Eventually JACK peeps out of a tiny passageway half-way down\r\n     his own street and on the opposite side of the road from his\r\n     PENSIONE.\r\n\r\n     The entrance to the PENSIONE is clear.\r\n\r\n     JACK crosses the street and slips inside.\r\n\r\n\r\n70   INT.

JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    71\r\n\r\n     From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned\r\n     deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made.\r\n\r\n     JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits\r\n     on the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n72   EXT. ROADSIDE PAY PHONE- MORNING                           72\r\n\r\n     A cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a\r\n     restaurant, a phone box.\r\n\r\n     JACK puts a coin in the slot.

He's not\r\n          with The Company, they're fast:\r\n          it's been three days and no TA.\r\n          He's not intel: they're deep\r\n          background and he wants to be\r\n          noticed. He might be a cowboy but\r\n          he can't be a cop: they work in\r\n          pairs and he's alone.

He\r\n     looks at her cautiously, with an expression that says: \"this\r\n     young woman is ruthless. If she were not, she wouldn't be\r\n     alive.\"\r\n\r\n     That's when he notices the CAR in his rear view mirror.\r\n\r\n     It's too far behind to decipher the make or model and it\r\n     weaves in and out of frame as JACK negotiates the alpine\r\n     road.\r\n\r\n     MATHILDE wakes with a start.

This is\r\n     the exact spot where he came to test the weapon.\r\n\r\n     MATHILDE gets out of the car and stretches.\r\n\r\n                         MATHILDE\r\n               Are those houses occupied?\r\n\r\n     JACK looks at the RUINED HAMLET on the hillside.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Derelict.

The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade.\r\n     JACK walks in front to ward off any snakes.\r\n\r\n     Everywhere there is a profusion of wild meadow flowers.\r\n     MATHILDE has never seen anything so beautiful. Overwhelmed,\r\n     she stops.\r\n\r\n     JACK stops. And watches her.\r\n\r\n     She undergoes the same transformation that he did.\r\n\r\n     Then she comes to, remembering herself... and walks on.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly... a four foot ASP VIPER slithers across JACK's\r\n     path.\r\n\r\n     He claps his hands and the SNAKE writhes for cover.\r\n                                                          46.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JACK walks on. MATHILDE follows, pretending not to be\r\n     frightened but walking closer to JACK now, scanning the long\r\n     grass warily.\r\n\r\n\r\n78   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                    78\r\n\r\n     JACK scrambles up towards the houses, checking the area for\r\n     signs of recent disturbance. MATHILDE follows.\r\n\r\n     From beside the end building JACK surveys the valley with a\r\n     tiny pair of binoculars, monitoring every square on the\r\n     imaginary grid for human activity.\r\n\r\n                         MATHILDE\r\n               You have tested the gun here\r\n               before?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Yes.\r\n\r\n     Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE\r\n     takes a deep breath of mountain air.\r\n\r\n                         MATHILDE\r\n               It's beautiful here.\r\n\r\n     She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was\r\n     once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she\r\n     leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from\r\n     the journey and the long, hot climb.\r\n\r\n                         MATHILDE\r\n               I wish everywhere could be this\r\n               tranquil.\r\n\r\n     JACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               You'd be out of a job.\r\n\r\n                         MATHILDE\r\n               You don't like the peace?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               It's hard to like something you\r\n               know nothing about.\r\n\r\n\r\n79   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                            79\r\n\r\n     The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the\r\n     parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes:\r\n\r\n     -a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a\r\n     chilled bottle of Aspirinio\r\n\r\n     -a loaf of course bread\r\n                                                     47.\r\n\r\n\r\n-two clods of mozarella\r\n\r\n-150 gms of proscuitto\r\n\r\n-100 gms of parma ham\r\n\r\n-a large jar of pitted green olives\r\n\r\n-a Thermos of sweet black coffee\r\n\r\n-and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the\r\nimproved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.\r\n\r\nAs MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill,\r\nJACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX.\r\n\r\nIt takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble\r\nthe bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND\r\nSUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty\r\nmagazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to\r\nher shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nShe's almost ten seconds faster than JACK.\r\n\r\nHe stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs\r\nand nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and\r\neverything it means.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Rounds?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I've made up two sorts.\r\n\r\nHe reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Thirty lead and thirty jacketed.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          I should like a hundred of each.\r\n\r\nIt's an order: her voice is emotionless.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          And fifty explosive.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Not a problem.\r\n\r\nHe hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge\r\nboxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Will mercury do?\r\n\r\nShe smiles almost imperceptibly.\r\n                                                     48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Mercury will do very nicely.\r\n\r\nShe puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side\r\nof the car.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          I have made my own targets.\r\n\r\nShe reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes\r\nseveral pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split\r\nbamboo cane.\r\n\r\nWithout speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In\r\nher wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass\r\ncrickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer\r\nskirt sweeps across the flowers.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Watch out for vipers.\r\n\r\nHe keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving\r\nwith her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES.\r\nShe's no fool.\r\n\r\nNeither is he. He has the gun.\r\n\r\nAt ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth\r\nstones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple\r\ntrumpet blooms.\r\n\r\nShe unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make\r\nout is a silver-grey shape against the stones.\r\n\r\nReturning to the car she picks up the weapon.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Muzzle velocity?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          At least three hundred and sixty\r\n          miles per hour. That's including\r\n          twenty off the top for the sound\r\n          suppression.\r\n\r\nImpressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the\r\nserial number has been removed with acid.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Socimi?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Eight-two-one.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          I've not had one before.\r\n                                                     49.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n             You'll find it easy. I've re-\r\n             balanced it for the longer barrel.\r\n             The fulcrum is two centimetres\r\n             forward of the grip now. Which\r\n             won't matter if you're firing- and\r\n             I'm guessing you are- from a fixed\r\n             position.\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n             No major recoil issues. You should\r\n             be able to hold onto any target.\r\n             Even the smallest.\r\n\r\nMATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and\r\nstands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the\r\nwalnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against\r\nher legs.\r\n\r\nCHOOP! CHOOP!\r\n\r\nFor a moment longer she holds on the target then lowers the\r\ngun, holding it under her arm like a lady on a shire hunt\r\nwould hold a 12 bore.\r\n\r\n                       MATHILDE\r\n             You've done a good job, Mr. Clarke.\r\n             Thank you. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nShe makes a minute adjustment to the telescopic sight, with\r\nher fingernail. She can't have turned the vertical screw more\r\nthan one notch.\r\n\r\nThen she fully loads and fires again.\r\n\r\nCHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!\r\n\r\nJACK lifts his binoculars and looks at the target. It's the\r\nunmistakable outline of a BOEING 747-400, about one and a\r\nhalf metres long. Painted against the cut-out is the upturn\r\nat the end of the wing. The front doorway is shaded in.\r\nStanding in it is the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. In the centre of\r\nhis head are three small HOLES.\r\n\r\nWith the magazine containing the remaining 28 jacketed\r\nrounds, MATHILDE takes aim again.\r\n\r\nCHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP-CHOOP!\r\n\r\nThrough his binoculars, JACK can see the empty space where\r\nthe target's head used to be, the scarred stones behind and\r\nthe little scraps of cardboard floating on the warm air.\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n             Good shot.\r\n                                                     50.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHILDE says nothing. She fills the magazine with lead\r\nrounds, snaps it in place and hands the weapon to JACK.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Go to the stones and fire near me.\r\n\r\nHe's taken aback.\r\n\r\n                       MATHILDE\r\n          Say...\r\n\r\nShe looks round for a target.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          ...into the bush with the yellow\r\n          flowers. Two bursts. Five seconds\r\n          apart.\r\n\r\nSlowly, JACK walks down to the stones, turns and looks back.\r\nThe CITROEN is well hidden in the deep shade of the walnut\r\ntree. So is MATHILDE. In the poor light all he can see is her\r\ndress and her blouse. He wipes the sweat from his eyes and\r\nshuts them tightly.\r\n\r\nThis is not just a weapon test... it's a test of trust.\r\n\r\nHe opens his eyes again.\r\n\r\nMATHILDE turns to face him as he shoulders the weapon.\r\n\r\nHe aims the SOCIMI at the YELLOW FLOWERS right beside her.\r\n\r\nHolds his breath.\r\n\r\nAnd pulls the trigger.\r\n\r\nCHOOP! CHOOP!\r\n\r\nMATHILDE remains untouched.\r\n\r\nSo do the YELLOW FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nTroubled, JACK blinks rapidly and counts to five.\r\n\r\nThen he fires again.\r\n\r\nCHOOP! CHOOP! CHOOP!\r\n\r\nThrough the sight, we see two stems of YELLOW BLOSSOM fall\r\nsideways.\r\n\r\nRelieved, JACK walks slowly back to the car.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          The sound suppression is superb. I\r\n          couldn't place the direction of\r\n          fire.\r\n                                                        51.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom her sports bag she removes a plain brown MANILLA\r\nENVELOPE.\r\n\r\n                       MATHILDE\r\n             I shall require the rounds and the\r\n             weapon by the first of next month.\r\n             In the meantime would you tighten\r\n             the adjusting screws on the sight,\r\n             they are too loose.

First: JACK puts her in a position she initially\r\n     resists. Then: he kisses her.\r\n\r\n     CLARA comes, not wanting to.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly, preoccupied, JACK does not.\r\n\r\n\r\n85   INT.

He did not say he\r\n               was from La Svizzera: Switzerland.\r\n               He said- forgive me the names in\r\n               Italian are so similar- La Svezia:\r\n               Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\n90   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- DAY                                      90\r\n\r\n     THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of\r\n     mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look\r\n     down over the little town, their faces frightening or\r\n     frightened.\r\n\r\n     JACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes\r\n     made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town\r\n     below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the\r\n     YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n     Nothing. Then he notices:\r\n\r\n     Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far\r\n     from the main square. An AUDI...\r\n\r\n     ...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market\r\n     sitting at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n91   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- NIGHT                        91\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop.\r\n\r\n     This is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early\r\n     thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and\r\n     expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and\r\n     there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just\r\n     beneath the collar of his shirt.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft\r\n     movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco)\r\n     and inserts the it between his top lip and gum.\r\n\r\n     It is a strangely sinister act.\r\n\r\n     Then he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso\r\n     and round the square heading towards...\r\n                                                           61.\r\n\r\n\r\n92   INT. BAR- NIGHT                                              92\r\n\r\n     JACK is sitting in the window, making himself as visible as\r\n     possible to the world outside.\r\n\r\n     He downs a Grappa: then gets up to pay for it. His movements\r\n     are slow and leisurely.\r\n\r\n     The BARMAN hands him his change. And a small white ENVELOPE.\r\n\r\n     JACK is not expecting this.\r\n\r\n                         BARMAN\r\n                   (in ITALIAN)\r\n               Someone left this for\r\n               \"L'Americano\". This afternoon.\r\n\r\n     JACK looks at the ENVELOPE.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n               Grazie.\r\n\r\n     He turns casually away from the BARMAN's prying eyes and\r\n     opens the envelope with extreme caution.\r\n\r\n     Inside is a folded CUTTING. It's from the Swedish Daily\r\n     newspaper \u00d6STERSUNDS-POSTEN.\r\n\r\n     JACK unfolds the cutting. We catch a glimpse of:\r\n\r\n     -Ingrid's dacha.\r\n\r\n     -A police line.\r\n\r\n     -Three dead bodies in the snow: the two hitmen and the girl.\r\n\r\n     Heart racing, JACK slips the cutting in his pocket.\r\n\r\n     Grabs three SUGAR CUBES from a silver bowl on the bar.\r\n\r\n     And leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n93   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- NIGHT                    93\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN is watching a PUPPET SHOW in the middle of the\r\n     square. The PUPPETEER is using glove puppets and the Punch\r\n     and Judy style performance involves Punch fucking Judy with a\r\n     grotesquely carved, outsize sex organ. There is a large crowd\r\n     gathered.\r\n\r\n     JACK leaves the bar, turning left and walking purposefully\r\n     down the street.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN follows.\r\n                                                           62.\r\n\r\n\r\n94   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                94\r\n\r\n     It's a hot summer night and there are more tourists than\r\n     usual.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN uses them as cover.\r\n\r\n     JACK turns down a dark, deserted alleyway.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN hesitates.\r\n\r\n     His right hand moves casually to his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n     And he follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n95   EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT                                         95\r\n\r\n     We're with the YOUNG MAN as he stalks his prey through the\r\n     mediaeval maze of streets...\r\n\r\n     We end up in the narrow alleyway that JACK photographed on\r\n     his first day in town.\r\n\r\n     Up ahead, disappearing round a distant bend, we catch a\r\n     glimpse of JACK, his heels CLACKING on the cobbles.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN follows swiftly, his trainers silent. He gets\r\n     to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS- all identical-\r\n     converge. The YOUNG MAN is unsure which alleyway to take.\r\n\r\n     The streets are empty.\r\n\r\n     He listens.\r\n\r\n     From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a late\r\n     night film on television. It's a romantic film, the violins\r\n     muffled and sad with longing.\r\n\r\n     From another alleyway comes the sound of SAVAGE BARKING. The\r\n     YOUNG MAN looks around for the source of the barking, but the\r\n     streets are empty.\r\n\r\n     Suddenly, the barking stops.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN looks confused.\r\n\r\n     From his right hand jacket pocket we hear the unmistakable\r\n     CLICK of a cocking mechanism.\r\n\r\n\r\n96   EXT. COURTYARD- NIGHT                                        96\r\n\r\n     We're recognise the secret courtyard: the one reached by\r\n     means of the hidden archway.\r\n\r\n     With one hand, JACK feeds another SUGAR CUBE to the MONGREL.\r\n                                                             63.\r\n\r\n\r\n     With the other hand, he holds his WALTHER behind his back...\r\n\r\n     ...and cocks it.\r\n\r\n\r\n97   EXT. ALLEYWAY- NIGHT                                          97\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN is waiting at the far end of the alleyway,\r\n     hugging the wall, scanning the CROSSROADS ahead, unsure which\r\n     of the four possible alleyways holds his prey.\r\n\r\n     JACK emerges from the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and walks quickly up\r\n     behind him.\r\n\r\n     JACK has removed his shoes and his bare feet are silent.\r\n\r\n     He has thirty metres to cover. The gun hangs heavy in his\r\n     right hand. It's fitted with a TAC 65 SOUND SUPPRESSOR. He\r\n     raises his right hand.\r\n\r\n     Twenty metres.\r\n\r\n     The gun is pointing at the YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n     Fifteen metres.\r\n\r\n     His finger takes up the slack of the trigger.\r\n\r\n     Ten meters.\r\n\r\n     Then:\r\n\r\n     A DUCATI turns into the alleyway behind JACK, its headlights\r\n     on full beam.\r\n\r\n     JACK drops his right hand and thrusts his silenced WALTHER\r\n     deep into his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN looks his way.\r\n\r\n     JACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light.\r\n\r\n     The two men are face to face, within spitting distance.\r\n\r\n     The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN.\r\n\r\n     The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET.\r\n\r\n     The YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear.\r\n\r\n     BANG!\r\n\r\n     The DUCATI misfires.\r\n\r\n     Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls\r\n     and fires back.\r\n\r\n     We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP!\r\n                                                           64.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and\r\n      lodges in the REAR COWLING.\r\n\r\n      The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone\r\n      staircase.\r\n\r\n      JACK looks around.\r\n\r\n      The YOUNG MAN has disappeared.\r\n\r\n      The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold.\r\n\r\n      The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking.\r\n\r\n      CHOOP!\r\n\r\n      A bullet hits the road not far from JACK.\r\n\r\n      CHOOP!\r\n\r\n      Another bullet hits the wall behind him.\r\n\r\n      Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI...\r\n\r\n\r\n98    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE,    MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT             98\r\n\r\n      JACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without\r\n      hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by\r\n      level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until...\r\n\r\n\r\n99    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT              99\r\n\r\n      JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on\r\n      the winding road.\r\n\r\n      Silence. All we can hear are the crickets.\r\n\r\n      Then the sound of a car.\r\n\r\n      An AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town.\r\n\r\n\r\n100   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                    100\r\n\r\n      JACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner\r\n      at 70 MPH.\r\n\r\n      The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him.\r\n\r\n\r\n101   EXT. ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT                                  101\r\n\r\n      JACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970\r\n      1000cc engine howling.\r\n\r\n      The AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating.\r\n                                                           65.\r\n\r\n\r\n102   INT.

He's sitting in a coffee shop under\r\n      the colonnade sucking a fruit drop and reading a copy of Il\r\n      Messagiero.\r\n\r\n      C.U. we see he's studying a small column concerning the\r\n      murder of two prostitutes in the nearby city of Chieti.\r\n\r\n      JACK spots CLARA walking along the corso. She's with a girl\r\n      he has not seen before. ANNA. ANNA is small town girl with a\r\n      keen sense of fashion. She and CLARA are hand in hand.\r\n\r\n      CLARA sees JACK and speaks to her friend.\r\n\r\n      They cross through the throng of boulevardiers.\r\n\r\n                          CLARA\r\n                My friend Anna.

Under the table,\r\nher knee presses against his.\r\n\r\nANNA also moves her chair nearer to JACK: but her motive is\r\nto move it out of the sun. She is not flirting.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Anna is learning English.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Have you been to England?\r\n\r\nANNA seems momentarily confused.\r\n\r\n                    ANNA\r\n          But you are...\r\n\r\nShe looks at CLARA.\r\n\r\n                    ANNA\r\n          Lui Americano?\r\n\r\n                      JACK\r\n          I am.\r\n\r\nJACK glances at CLARA.\r\n\r\nHow much has she told her friend?\r\n\r\n                    ANNA\r\n          Ah.

The\r\n                streets are not... pave-ed with\r\n                gold.\r\n\r\n      She beams happily at JACK. He smiles back at her.\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n                If not with gold, than at least not\r\n                with enough medieval cobbles to\r\n                loosen every-self tapping screw in\r\n                a Fiat.\r\n\r\n      JACK beams. Neither girl understands. But everyone smiles\r\n      happily.\r\n\r\n      The WAITER brings the coffee and CLARA insists on paying.\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n                Where do you come from, Anna?\r\n\r\n      ANNA frowns.

I live in Via dell'\r\n                Argilla. Nearby to Clara.\r\n\r\n      JACK briefly wonders what else he could teach her. He scans\r\n      both girls and decides CLARA is the prettier. CLARA seems to\r\n      sense this. She smiles to herself.\r\n\r\n      JACK is touched.\r\n\r\n\r\n114   EXT.

JACK rises.\r\n\r\n                          CLARA\r\n                Perhaps we will have a drink\r\n                together soon? I am free...\r\n\r\n      Her words sound rehearsed.

How much she\r\n      knows is uncertain. She kisses him swiftly and softly on the\r\n      cheek.\r\n\r\n      CLARA does the same on the lips. Behind the mischief in her\r\n      eyes is something doubtful. Has she gone too far?\r\n\r\n\r\n115   EXT.

JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    116\r\n\r\n      JACK opens a black combination lock SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE and\r\n      lines the bottom and sides with the lead-lined film\r\n      protection bags, cut to fit.\r\n\r\n      Into the base of the briefcase he glues pre-shaped pieces of\r\n      firm grey plastic foam. These form the pockets into which he\r\n      slots the constituent parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN.\r\n      They fit perfectly.\r\n\r\n      Over this JACK uses the HOOKS and EYES to clip a false\r\n      bottom: a tough card cover onto which are pasted the custom\r\n      made headed notepaper, invoice books, notepads and envelopes.\r\n                                                           74.\r\n\r\n\r\n      To the briefcase's central divider he adds the metal pens, a\r\n      calculator and a mobile phone. He sets the combination to\r\n      821. Then shuts and locks the BRIEFCASE.\r\n\r\n      This done he sits on the bed and stares at the case. With his\r\n      work complete, he is struck by a terrible sense of emptiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n117   EXT. PARCO DELLA RESISTENZA - JUST BEFORE DAWN              117\r\n\r\n      A small park not far from Castel Del Monte's town square.\r\n\r\n      It is just after dawn. The pine trees and the poplars are\r\n      silent. The sun is not yet up but the day is light. Sparrows\r\n      hop about, searching for crumbs.\r\n\r\n      JACK, ravaged by lack of sleep, wonders about like the demon\r\n      of a lost darkness, looking for his hole down to the\r\n      underworld.\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                Buon giorno!\r\n\r\n      He's twenty meters away, his hand raised in half-welcome,\r\n      half-benediction.\r\n\r\n      They greet one another and FATHER BENEDETTO falls into slow\r\n      step with JACK. The priest walks with his hands behind his\r\n      back. JACK with his hands in his pockets.\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                I walk here to meditate. Once a\r\n                week, Wednesday, the farthest one\r\n                can travel in the week from the\r\n                Sabbath. The trees are like the\r\n                Stations of the Cross: by certain\r\n                trees I thank God for certain\r\n                favours he has granted me, or\r\n                certain gifts he has made to me and\r\n                all men. For example, here by this\r\n                pine, I thank him for the many\r\n                friendships I have and ask him to\r\n                look after those of my friends who\r\n                are troubled.\r\n\r\n      They reach a Cypress tree and FATHER BENEDETTO bows his head\r\n      in prayer. After a while he says:\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                Some walk here in the cool of\r\n                evening. Others come at night.\r\n\r\n      There is a slight sadness in his voice as he says to himself:\r\n\r\n                          FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                I wonder how many bastards have\r\n                been made here?\r\n                                                75.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gives a small sideways glance at JACK.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Perhaps you'll stay and settle here\r\n          yourself?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          What makes you think I'm leaving?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You told me as much when we first\r\n          met. Besides, those who seek for\r\n          peace seldom find it. They're\r\n          always moving on, looking\r\n          elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are\r\n          usually sinners.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          All men are sinners.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Some are greater sinners than\r\n          others. And those who seek peace\r\n          have much sinning in their history.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I don't seek peace. I never have.\r\n\r\n                       FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Until now.\r\n\r\n                     JACK\r\n          Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The\r\n          valley. The villages. The\r\n          mountains.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Forgive me. This is the priest in\r\n          me speaking. And the friend. But\r\n          you have done much sinning, Signor\r\n          Clarke. You still do.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I see a whore. She's young enough\r\n          to be my daughter.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          I do not refer to the sins of\r\n          carnality. But to the deadly\r\n          sins...\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Aren't all sins equal?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          We are not discussing theology, my\r\n          friend, but you.

Yet you\r\n          cannot. There is something you\r\n          cannot ignore. Some force. Some\r\n          enemy.\r\n\r\nJACK is silent.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You want to speak but you dare not.\r\n          You know no one sufficiently well\r\n          to share your history with them.\r\n          You know I am trustworthy yet still\r\n          you are cautious.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          What job do you do, Signor? Are you\r\n          on the run, as they say?\r\n\r\n                      JACK\r\n          Who says?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          It's an expression, no?\r\n\r\n                     JACK\r\n          Everyone's on the run from\r\n          something.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Some men watch some of the shadows.\r\n          You watch them all.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I've done nothing I didn't have\r\n          good cause to do.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Do you wish to tell me?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          For what reason?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          For your own sake. Perhaps I can\r\n          pray for you?\r\n\r\nA change of pace.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I make things. Artifacts.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Counterfeit money?\r\n                                                     77.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Why do you say that?\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          You work in metal. You are given\r\n          some steel by Fabio, the car\r\n          doctor.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          You know a lot about me.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          I know only what you do in the\r\n          town. People talk to me. I am their\r\n          priest and they trust me.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          And I should too?\r\n\r\n                       FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Of course.\r\n\r\nThey stare at one another.\r\n\r\nJACK wants to confess. He does not know why.\r\n\r\nBut he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting:\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he\r\n          conceived here father?\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO is motionless.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Why do you ask me that?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          He looks like you. Even more than\r\n          he does in the photos you keep of\r\n          each other. Where was he conceived,\r\n          father? Under one of these trees?\r\n          At night? Like all the other\r\n          bastards?\r\n\r\nThere is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up\r\nat JACK with extraordinary intensity.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          I do not remember, Signor. It was\r\n          twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes\r\ndust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak\r\nagain until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees.\r\n                                                           78.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                 In the end it is I who confesses to\r\n                 you.\r\n\r\n                           JACK\r\n                 Expecting me to reciprocate?\r\n\r\n                           FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                 Perhaps. For your own good. You\r\n                 cannot doubt the existence of Hell.\r\n                 You live in it. It is a place\r\n                 without love. As for me, I go about\r\n                 my daily duties because the town\r\n                 requires it of me. Some know what\r\n                 you know. Perhaps I have no right\r\n                 to wear these robes. But I do have\r\n                 a heart full of a father's love.\r\n                 Something close to His heart! And\r\n                 for that I am both grateful and\r\n                 happy.\r\n\r\n      On JACK.\r\n\r\n                           FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n                 What do you have, my friend?\r\n\r\n      Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face.\r\n\r\n      The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from\r\n      the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n118   INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING                                  118\r\n\r\n      JACK dresses very carefully for dinner.\r\n\r\n      It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon\r\n      CLARA.\r\n\r\n\r\n119   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT                               119\r\n\r\n      Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda\r\n      that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and\r\n      jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars.\r\n\r\n      Of the thirty or so candle-lit tables that dot the veranda,\r\n      more than half are occupied by romantic couples.\r\n\r\n      JACK scans the tables and checks his watch. It's shortly\r\n      after seven pm and there's no sign of CLARA.\r\n\r\n      He waits. Then turns to leave.\r\n\r\n                           CLARA (O.S.)\r\n                 Ciao.\r\n                                                              79.\r\n\r\n\r\n      She kisses him once on the lips. She's hot and flustered.\r\n      She's been rushing.\r\n\r\n                          CLARA\r\n                I did not think you would come.\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n                I wasn't sure you meant me to.\r\n\r\n      CLARA looks doubtful. It's the same look she gave him at the\r\n      cafe. She is breaking the golden rule of prostitution.\r\n      Getting involved. Her heart is pulling one way and her head\r\n      another.\r\n\r\n                             CLARA\r\n                Certo.\r\n\r\n      A WAITER approaches.\r\n\r\n                             WAITER\r\n                Per due?\r\n\r\n      Judging by his disapproving tone, the WAITER seems to know\r\n      what CLARA does for a living. CLARA senses this immediately.\r\n\r\n                             CLARA\r\n                Si.\r\n\r\n\r\n120   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPPELLI- NIGHT                                 120\r\n\r\n      CLARA and JACK sit at a table overlooking the town.\r\n\r\n      The WAITER lights their candle and deposits two menus\r\n      peremptorily.\r\n\r\n                          CLARA\r\n                Una botiglia di acqua minerale non\r\n                gasata et... una Parasini, per\r\n                favore.\r\n\r\n      Completely ignoring her, the WAITER addresses JACK with a\r\n      wink.\r\n\r\n                          WAITER\r\n                Menu in Inglese?\r\n\r\n      A beat.\r\n\r\n                          JACK\r\n                No, grazie.\r\n\r\n                          WAITER\r\n                Tedesco? Olandese?\r\n\r\n                          CLARA\r\n                    (to the WAITER)\r\n                He speaks Italian. So do I. Listen:\r\n                                                        80.\r\n\r\n\r\nShe repeats her order, articulating each word emphatically,\r\nlike a teacher to a slow school child:\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Una botiglia di acqua minerale et\r\n          una Parasini, per favore.\r\n\r\nShe isn't upset. It's just her way of letting both men know\r\nthat she's in charge.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER turns to her, deferring to her strength of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n                    WAITER\r\n          Gasata?\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Non gasata.\r\n\r\nHe nods with some genuine deference and leaves.\r\n\r\nCLARA sighs.\r\n\r\n                     CLARA\r\n              (mostly to herself)\r\n          Cittadina.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Small towns.\r\n\r\nJACK smiles. CLARA smiles back. They have this contempt in\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nThe WAITER reappears and pours a thumbful of wine. It is pale\r\nred in colour and frizzante. At CLARA's insistence, JACK\r\ntastes it. It is dry and has a tar-like aftertaste.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Parasini. From Calabria. It is\r\n          good, you will agree?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          It is. Very good.\r\n\r\nHe looks at her and- for a brief moment- he undergoes what is\r\na unique experience for him: a positive longing to repeat\r\nthis brief moment many times in the future.\r\n\r\nCLARA catches the glow of his warmth and blossoms.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Can I ask you something, Eduardo?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Sure.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          You are married?\r\n                                                     81.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          No.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I doubt any of the couples here\r\n          are. With the exception of the\r\n          Germans at table seven. She's\r\n          wearing a wedding ring and they\r\n          haven't spoken a word to each other\r\n          for eight and half minutes.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          I was sure this was your secret.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          What makes you think I have a\r\n          secret? I'm an ordinary man. I\r\n          cough. I fart. I earn a living.\r\n\r\nJACK observes a GYPSY selling roses.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          I do not think you are an ordinary\r\n          man. I think you are a good man.\r\n          But you have a secret.\r\n\r\nThe GYPSY approaches, offering CLARA a ROSE. She refuses\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          He thinks we are a couple.\r\n\r\nJACK signals to the GYPSY and buys CLARA a ROSE.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Why spoil the illusion?\r\n\r\nShe looks at him and smiles.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n              (in ITALIAN)\r\n          As long as we know it is an\r\n          illusion.\r\n\r\nHer smile is only a little bit sad.\r\n\r\nStill, JACK doesn't know what to say.\r\n\r\nThey are saved by the appearance of the WAITER.\r\n\r\n                    WAITER\r\n          Buona sera. Desidera?\r\n\r\nCLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his\r\nease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and\r\nmoves.\r\n                                                             82.\r\n\r\n\r\n121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121\r\n\r\n      JACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth.\r\n      They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his.\r\n      They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging\r\n      with   other couples.\r\n\r\n\r\n122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122\r\n\r\n      The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO\r\n      are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK\r\n      is the oldest person there.\r\n\r\n      The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small\r\n      silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In\r\n      front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae.\r\n      CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl.

And you'll see\r\n          a wonder.\r\n\r\nShe grips the seat again.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          You won't need to hold on. I'll go\r\n          slowly. Just relax and look.\r\n\r\nHe eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move\r\nforward, the springs squeaking slightly. After 50 metres JACK\r\ntwists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes.\r\nThey roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and\r\ncome to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample WALNUT\r\nTREE.\r\n\r\nBeyond them is the LAKE, the MEADOWS and the RUINED HAMLET.\r\nThe hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and\r\nblossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. By the\r\nedge of the lake stands a HERON, still as fence post.\r\n\r\nCLARA gets out of the car, dumbstruck. JACK gets out too. He\r\nwatches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through\r\nhis miniature binoculars. Deserted. By the time CLARA turns\r\ntowards him, the binoculars are hidden.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          No one comes here?\r\n\r\nShe speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her.\r\n\r\n                      JACK\r\n          No.\r\n\r\n                      CLARA\r\n          Just you.\r\n\r\n                      JACK\r\n          Yes.\r\n                                                     94.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the\r\ngrass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows\r\nand patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut.\r\nShe kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and\r\nunzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps\r\ndaintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK.\r\n\r\nJACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward\r\nwithout meaning to.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Well?\r\n\r\nShe is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          I am going to swim in the lake. Are\r\n          you coming?\r\n\r\nShe doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through\r\nthe grass towards the water.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso!\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Maybe!

As he removes his clothes, he stalls for\r\ntime, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED\r\nPURSE.\r\n\r\nWe can see it wedged under the passenger seat.\r\n\r\nDue to the design of the car, JACK cannot.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Come!\r\n\r\nJACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the\r\ncaution of years he does not remove his shoes until he\r\nreaches the water's edge.\r\n                                                     95.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARA is standing in the middle.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Stand by me.\r\n\r\nHe obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his\r\nhand under the water, holding it out in front of them.\r\n\r\nJACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed.\r\nBrassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Keep still. Watch.\r\n\r\nAs the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY\r\nFISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They\r\nhover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move\r\nin to nibble at the skin on their fingers.\r\n\r\n                     JACK\r\n          If we stay here for a year, they'll\r\n          devour us.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          It is said that if these fishes\r\n          bite at two hands holding, then\r\n          love is good for the people.\r\n\r\nHe looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nShe kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and\r\nbody as pure and warm as the water.\r\n\r\nHe tries helplessly to pull away.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Maybe we should...\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Do you make love in the water?\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n          I haven't.\r\n\r\nShe places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from\r\nthe smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She\r\ntries to push herself onto him but he resists.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          What's wrong?\r\n\r\nHe doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused,\r\nsearching.\r\n\r\n                       JACK\r\n          Let's eat.\r\n                                                           96.\r\n\r\n\r\n      He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart\r\n      around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds,\r\n      travelling with the waves made by their departure.\r\n\r\n\r\n137   EXT.

What's\r\n           the point of a gun if it's not\r\n           loaded?\r\n\r\n                     CLARA\r\n           One of the girls borrow it to me\r\n           after the second hooker in Chieti\r\n           is murdered. With some of the\r\n           clients it make me feel safe. I\r\n           don't tell the police, of course,\r\n           but... Madonna, Eduardo. How they\r\n           do to these two women! A police\r\n           agente from Rome show me\r\n           photographs. They show photographs\r\n           to everyone in Via Lampedusa.\r\n\r\nCLARA shivers with disgust.\r\n\r\n                     CLARA\r\n           Non capito... how one person hurt\r\n           another in this way.\r\n\r\nJACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution.\r\n\r\n                     JACK\r\n           Does the gun make you feel safer\r\n           with me?\r\n\r\n                     CLARA\r\n           You are not a client.\r\n\r\n                     JACK\r\n           Then why's it in your purse?\r\n\r\nCLARA looks unhappy.\r\n\r\n                     CLARA\r\n           I have to work tonight, amore.\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nJACK looks away.\r\n\r\n                     JACK (V.O.)\r\n           Maybe this is suicide. Cops often\r\n           put the graft on working girls.\r\n           Perhaps the girl I told you about,\r\n           Clara, has sold me out.\r\n                     (MORE)\r\n                                                    100.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.O.) (cont'd)\r\n          Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe\r\n          she's a hired gun. Then again,\r\n          maybe Clara is who she says she is\r\n          and my Belgian clients will take\r\n          the gun, shoot me themselves and\r\n          keep the money. Always a risk in my\r\n          profession. Or perhaps my trusted\r\n          colleague in Rome no longer trusts\r\n          me. Perhaps even you, Father, with\r\n          your connections in Naples...\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          What will you do?\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I guess I'll go to work too.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          And after that? Tomorrow and the\r\n          next day.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I can't stay here forever.\r\n\r\nAs the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.O.)\r\n          It's not that I've given up on\r\n          life, Father. Just the way that I\r\n          was living it. If you can call it\r\n          living.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          I want always to stay here.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          It's time to go home.\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Let me come to your home.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I can't, Clara. One day...\r\n\r\nShe's upset but decides not to press her demand.\r\n\r\n                    JACK (V.O.)\r\n          If I had one request, Father, it\r\n          would be this. That it's not Clara\r\n          who finally pulls the trigger. But\r\n          whoever it is...\r\n\r\nCLARA kisses him and simply says:\r\n\r\n                    CLARA\r\n          Stay forever here.\r\n                                                          101.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           JACK (V.O.)\r\n                 ...by this time tomorrow I'll be\r\n                 dead.\r\n\r\n      Fade to black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      FADE IN:\r\n\r\n\r\n139   EXT/INT.

The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that\r\n      spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n142   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                        142\r\n\r\n      JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks\r\n      backwards and forwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n143   EXT. SERVICE STATION- DAY                                   143\r\n\r\n      JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a\r\n      forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a\r\n      convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe.\r\n\r\n      The car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the\r\n      EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised.\r\n\r\n      JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and\r\n      slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n      Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's\r\n      only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the\r\n      distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak...\r\n\r\n      JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away.\r\n      He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't.\r\n\r\n      As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the\r\n      source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine\r\n      oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze.\r\n\r\n\r\n144   INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY                                   144\r\n\r\n      Empty.\r\n\r\n      JACK sits at a table at the back of the cafe. From here he\r\n      can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service\r\n      entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. Through the\r\n      window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the\r\n      slip road to and from the autostrada.\r\n\r\n      JACK places the BRIEFCASE on a chair beside him and puts a\r\n      PAPER BAG on the table next to the sugar dispenser. He checks\r\n      his watch. It is two minutes before noon. He orders an\r\n      espresso.\r\n\r\n      His nerve-heightened senses take in everything: the sound of\r\n      the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip-lights and the creak,\r\n      creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly\r\n      revolving.\r\n\r\n      JACK's eyes flick outside to the forecourt.\r\n                                                    103.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear the cafe door open.\r\n\r\nAnd in an instant, MATHILDE is at his table.\r\n\r\nShe is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse\r\nand a dark blue jacket. Her hair is neatly styled, her make-\r\nup immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before.\r\nShe looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a\r\nSamsonite briefcase.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Hello. I see you have brought it in\r\n          from the car with you.\r\n\r\nShe speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          All there, as agreed.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          What's in the paper bag?\r\n\r\nThe WAITRESS comes over with Jack's coffee. MATHILDE orders\r\nanother for herself.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          Sweets. For your journey.\r\n\r\nShe opens the bag and takes out one of the TINS.\r\n\r\nShe can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          That is most thoughtful of you.\r\n\r\nThe polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight\r\nBelgian accent.\r\n\r\nThe WAITRESS returns with the second espresso and MATHILDE\r\npays for them both.\r\n\r\nJACK watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. She's\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          I suppose I'll read about this in\r\n          the Times or the International\r\n          Herald Tribune. Or Il Maessagiero.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she is pensive.\r\n\r\n                    MATHILDE\r\n          Yes, I expect so.\r\n                                                          104.\r\n\r\n\r\n      She drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid-air and looking\r\n      out the window.\r\n\r\n      JACK follows her eye-line to check she's not signalling to an\r\n      accomplice.\r\n\r\n      The FORECOURT is still empty.\r\n\r\n      Creak, creak, creak, creak...\r\n\r\n      MATHILDE looks at JACK. Her expression is impossible to read.\r\n      Perhaps it's tinged with sadness. She drinks the rest of her\r\n      coffee.\r\n\r\n                          MATHILDE\r\n                I'm just going to the ladies. Wait\r\n                here.\r\n\r\n      She picks up the CASE.\r\n\r\n      There is nothing JACK can do about this.

STREET- DAY                                            164\r\n\r\n      LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square.\r\n\r\n      He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone,\r\n      scanning the crowds around him.\r\n\r\n      In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps\r\n      free of a row cars on the other side of the street.\r\n\r\n      As LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING\r\n      SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands.\r\n\r\n      And LARRY sees JACK.\r\n\r\n      LARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger.\r\n\r\n      L'AMERICANO throws himself to one side.\r\n\r\n      There is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along\r\n      the line of parked cars.\r\n\r\n      PANIC erupts.\r\n\r\n      JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover\r\n      behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst.\r\n\r\n      JACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun...\r\n\r\n      ...and retrieves it just as LARRY fires again.\r\n\r\n      SCREAMS spread through the holiday crowd like a wave of fire\r\n      moving down the street and spilling into the town square.\r\n                                                          114.\r\n\r\n\r\n165   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                       165\r\n\r\n      JACK runs into the square.\r\n\r\n      LARRY pursues him, firing for a third time.\r\n\r\n      The buzz of spent rounds and the crack of muzzle fire echo\r\n      around the square, bouncing off the walls and confusing the\r\n      crowd.\r\n\r\n      People start to run in different directions- everyone heading\r\n      for the maze of alleys that surround the main square.\r\n\r\n      ALTAR BOYS scatter. So do the LOCAL MEN carrying the STATUE\r\n      OF SAINT DOMINIC. The STATUE tumbles and smashes. Escaping\r\n      SNAKES writhe. FATHER BENEDETTO takes cover.\r\n\r\n      The two LOCAL CARABINIERI in their Land Rover get caught up\r\n      in the chaos. Confused, they turn on their SIRENS.\r\n\r\n      LARRY spots JACK in the crowd and fires a fourth time.\r\n\r\n      One TOURIST is killed outright, another injured\r\n\r\n      JACK dives for cover behind the STATUE OF THE EAGLE where he\r\n      spotted Clara.\r\n\r\n      Bullets ricochet.\r\n\r\n                          LARRY\r\n                You're too old for this life, Jack.\r\n\r\n      LARRY struggles for breath as he reloads.\r\n\r\n      This is JACK's chance.\r\n\r\n                           LARRY\r\n                You get sentimental then you fuck\r\n                things up.\r\n\r\n      Rolling along the steps to the statue of the eagle, JACK\r\n      spreads his legs, faces LARRY and fires the customary TWO\r\n      PRECISION-ENGINEERED SHOTS that make up a military-style\r\n      execution:\r\n\r\n      The first shot hits LARRY in the heart. LARRY is thrown\r\n      backwards against a parked car, accidentally altering his arc\r\n      of fire as slugs bounce off the steps beside JACK, chips of\r\n      marble stinging against his calves.\r\n\r\n      Again, JACK takes aim.\r\n\r\n      A beat as his finger tightens on the trigger.\r\n\r\n      HEADSHOT. Half LARRY'S FACE is wiped out of existence. What's\r\n      left of him slides down the parked car onto both knees. His\r\n      hand flashes to his mangled throat then drops. He falls\r\n      forwards and his STERLING clatters on the cobble stones.\r\n                                                    115.\r\n\r\n\r\nComplete silence.\r\n\r\nNot even the sound of a siren.\r\n\r\nThe town square is empty.\r\n\r\nExcept for FATHER BENEDETTO hiding in the wreckage of the\r\nbroken STATUE.\r\n\r\nJack's WALTHER hangs ominously by his side.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO stands unsteadily.\r\n\r\nLike lightening JACK spins, instinctively raising his WALTHER\r\nand zeroing in on FATHER BENEDETTO. His face is devoid of all\r\nemotion. He is a bloody machine looking at a potential\r\ntarget.\r\n\r\nWe hear SIRENS.\r\n\r\nAcross a slew of dead bodies, JACK keeps the gun pointed at\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO stands stock still, facing JACK.\r\n\r\nThe SIRENS get louder.\r\n\r\n                    JACK\r\n          What will you tell them?\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO takes something from inside his Soutane.\r\n\r\nAnd holds it up with a trembling hand.\r\n\r\nJACK'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          I will them that the man who wrote\r\n          this letter is my friend.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO smiles sadly.\r\n\r\n                    FATHER BENEDETTO\r\n          Jack.\r\n\r\nFATHER BENEDETTO shuts his eyes, muttering a quiet prayer.\r\n\r\nThe SIRENS get closer.\r\n\r\nWe hear Carabinieri screeching to a halt and clambering out\r\nof their cars, cocking submachine guns.\r\n\r\nWhen FATHER BENEDETTO opens his eyes again...\r\n\r\n...JACK has disappeared.\r\n                                                          116.\r\n\r\n\r\n166   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                                 166\r\n\r\n      Using his meticulous knowledge of the alleyways and lanes\r\n      that make up the medieval heart of the town, JACK avoids the\r\n      CARABINIERI and, stealing a bicycle, makes it onto the main\r\n      road before a road block has been set up.\r\n\r\n\r\n167   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, LEFT LUGGAGE- DAY            167\r\n\r\n      JACK collects a sports bag from a LOCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n168   EXT.

L'AQUILA, COACH STATION, MAIN HALL- DAY               169\r\n\r\n      When he emerges from the bathroom JACK is wearing the clothes\r\n      of a fifty year-old American tourist from the mid-West with\r\n      glasses and a baseball cap.\r\n\r\n      He checks the time of next bus to Rome.\r\n\r\n      Then glances at his watch.\r\n\r\n      He has thirty minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n170   EXT. L'AQUILA, STREET- DAY                                 170\r\n\r\n      JACK walks towards Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.\r\n\r\n      Two hundred metres up ahead, two OFFICERS of the Guardia di\r\n      Finanza wait in an unmarked car.\r\n\r\n      JACK walks past Clara's APARTMENT BUILDING.\r\n\r\n      And keeps walking.\r\n\r\n\r\n171   EXT. L'AQUILA, COACH STATION- DAY                          171\r\n\r\n      The BUS for Rome is barely half-full.\r\n\r\n      Blending in perfectly with a group of middle aged American\r\n      tourists, JACK boards the steps, purchases a ticket and takes\r\n      a seat at the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n172   EXT.
