DUNGEON - TUNNELS - NIGHT (DISTORTED)\n\nThe agonizing SCREAMS continue as we MOVE rapidly through a \nlabyrinth of winding underground tunnels.  Glowing torches light \nthe way.  Blurry, indistinct silhouettes of grim FIGURES wearing \nblack-cowled robes flash along the dank, craggy walls.\n\nAs we BLAST around dark corners, we realize we are looking from \nthe P.O.V. of a SCREAMING young woman being pushed forward on a \ngurney.  Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.\n\nA door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.\n\nSpurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a \nMYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  \nWidebrimmed fedora.  Lit cigarette dangling between gloved \nfingers.\n\nINT. BIRTHING CHAMBER - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nA rat scampers from a hole, foraging in the muck of a rotted \nrack.  A white sheet, saturated with blood, covers the parted legs \nof JAMIE LLOYD, now 16, cheeks flushed with perspiration.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tOh, God, it's coming!  It's coming!\n\nMARY, a young midwife, rushes in with a bowl of hot water.  Jamie \nlurches, knocking the bowl out of the girl's hands; it SHATTERS on \nthe floor.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\t   (continuing)\n\tMary, mother of God, please make it stop!\n\nMary's face is frozen in horror.  Jamie's SCREAMS build to an \nunnerving crescendo.  The paiin too much for her to bear.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     FLASH CUT TO:\n\nLurid SHOCK CUTS from the previous \"Halloween\" entries -- a \nsurrealistic blend of IMAGES and VOICES -- as Jamie relives her \nterrifying childhood ordeal:\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS (V.O.)\n\t...

Now he wants her daughter.\n\nB)   Trapped in her bedroom, 10-YEAR-OLD JAMIE (Danielle Harris) \n     struggles to open the door.  She flings it open.

TINA (Wendy Kaplan) dives \n     right into the path of the Shape's knife.  \"Jamie, run!!!\"\n\nD)   Jamie sinks to her knees behind the fallen Shape, taking its \n     hand in her own.  CLOSE ON the Shape's hand.  Fingers flexing to \n     life.  A grotesque BRAND on its wrist -- an inverted isocsceles \n     triangle that will come to be known as the mark of THORN.\n\nE)   BLINDING EXPLOSION rips through cinderblock.  A jail cell blown \n     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, \n     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.\n\nPitiful wails of death.  OFFICERS writhing in pools of blood.  In \nthe aftermath of this carnage stands YOUNG JAMIE.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     FLASH CUT TO:\n\nINT. CHAMBER - NIGHT (SAME)\n\nJamie struggles against her bonds.  Pushing.  SCREAMING.  Lapsing \nin and out of consciousness during the excruciating pangs of \nlabor.  Haunted by low, moaning VOICES.  CHANTING.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     FLASH CUT TO:\n\nEXT. POLICE STATION - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT (NEW FOOTAGE)\n\nRESUME Jamie, filled with repidation as she staggers through the \nsmoke-filled cell into a darkened, drizzly alleyway.\n\nJAMIE'S P.O.V.\n\nBeyond the clearing wisps of smoke, THREE FIGURES wearing black \nski masks usher THE SHAPE -- arms and legs shackled in heavy \nchains -- into the back of a white van.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nMutely terrified, Jamie backs away -- into the arms of another \nfigure, obscured by smokescreen:  the Mysterious Stranger!\n\nJamie's scream is cut off as the Stranger descends upon her like \nthe Angel of Death.\n\nA cigarette arcs throug the darkness like a tiny flare.  Crushed \nunder the boot of the Stranger.\n\nA moment later, Jamie is shoved into the front seat of the van.  \nDoors SLAM.  Tires SCREECH over wet pavement.\n\nTHE ENTIRE PRECINCT EXPLODES IN A HUGE CONFLAGRATION!\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     SHOCK CUT TO:\n\nINT. CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\nA SLAP and the first cry of the newborn BABY.  Jamie sobs \nuncontrollably, the straps preventing her from reaching him.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tPlease ... give him to me ...\n\nThe infant is wrapped in black swaddling.  The wooden door CREAKS \nopen.  Jamie's eyes fill with horror as the shadow of the Stranger \nfills the room.  Standing at the threshold.  Waiting to receive \nthe child.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\t   (continuing)\n\tNo, please ... my baby!\n\nThe dark sentinels march out in somber procession, ignoring her \ndesperate pleas.  Torches lighting the way.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\t   (continuing)\n\tDamn you!!  Damn you all to hell!!!\n\nJamie's heartrending SHRIEKS are cut off by the cold sound of the \nSLAMMING DOOR.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     FADE TO BLACK.\n\nMAIN TITLE SEQUENCE\n\nA diaphanous column rises, a ghostly, slow-motion cylinder of \nflame that BURNS through the SCREEN to form the MAIN TITLE:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tHALLOWEEN 6\n\nThe OPENING CREDITS are BRANDED against the BLACK SCREEN by an \ninvisible, kenetic force, interspersed with a SERIES OF CUTS:\n\nJamie's baby is lain upon a primitive altar.  Ringed by eleven \nstones engraved with cryptic markings.\n\nHooded, faceless figures.  Torches held aloft.  Disembodied \nVOICES.  Whispering.  Invoking a dark spell.\n\nMARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with \nhorror.  Watching.  Spying.\n\nThe newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a \ntriangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.\n\nWe MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns \noff into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.\n\nSilence.  Then a startling CLAP OF THUNDER as we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     SHOCK CUT TO:\n\nA SIGN POST\n\nstanding askew in a matted patch of lawn.  WIND and RAIN.  INTENSE \nFLASH of LIGHTNING illuminates:\n\n\"For Sale By Strode Realty - SOLD\"\n\nEXT/INT. MYERS HOUSE - SUBJECTIVE P.O.V.\n\nMOVE along a trail of drowning toys -- baseball, Power Rangers, a \ndeck of Pogs -- TOWARD a weather-beaten porch.  Leftover gallons \nof Sears Best.  Brushes soaking in turpentine.  A dozen or so 2 x \n2s l;ined up to replace a row of broken railing slats.\n\nP.O.V. LOOKS UP to the tall, brooding edifice.  Address reads:  45 \nLampkin Lane.  Fresh coat of white paint over old clapboard.  New \nshutters on the narrow windows.  A jack-o'-lantern grins behind \nfilmy curtains.  The Myers house.\n\nDespite its recent face-lift, it looks just as foreboding as it \ndid in \"Halloween I.\"\n\nP.O.V. stalks down the side of the house, around to the back \ndoor.  Opens it and quietly MOVES inside.\n\nP.O.V. MOVES across the darkened kitchen.  A drawer is opened.  \nLIGHTNING reveals a large butcher knife being withdrawn.\n\nP.O.V. glides past the living room -- a few boxes, furniture to be \narranged -- and MOVES swiftly UP a long flight of stairs.\n\nDown the long, dark hallway ... through a door.  A bedroom.  \nP.O.V. FINDS 6-year-old DANNY STRODE ... tossing and turning in \nthe throes of a nightmare.\n\nAn ear-splitting THUNDER CRASH causes the boy to bolt upright in \nbed, looking right into the P.O.V.  Sweating.  Shaking.  \nPetrified.\n\nDANNY'S P.O.V.\n\nThe THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a \n24\" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic \nmonsters.  Seemingly brought to life by the ELECTRICAL STORM.\n\nFOLLOW DANNY\n\nas he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into \nthe hallway.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  With the next THUNDER CRASH \ncomes a startling, barely intelligible VOICE.\n\t\t\n\t\tWHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)\n\tDanny ...\n\nDanny freezes.  Slowly turns.\n\nDANNY'S POV\n\nAn ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by \nLIGHTNING.  Long duster and brimmed hat.  The Stranger!  In his \noutstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!\n\t\t\n\t\tWHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)\n\tKill for him!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nDanny screams!  THUNDER CRASHES HELLISHLY.  Lights flash on.  \nDoors fly open.  Suddenly Danny is swept up in the protective arms \nof his mother, KARA, 22.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny!\n\nThe little boy holds onto her for dear life.  Crying \nhysterically.  Eyes clenched tightly.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (continuing)\n\tShh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tThe voice man!  He's here!\n\nKara looks in the direction he's pointing.  In the light there's \njust an antique coat rack -- \"dressed\" in a hat, rain jacket and \nold silver-tipped umbrella.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, no one's there.\n\nDanny dares to look -- but now only cries harder.\n\nKara carries Danny back to his room, averting the steely-eyed gaze \nof her father, JOHN STRODE, staunch, late 40s, wearing boxer \nshorts and a well-worn undershirt.\n\t\t\n\t\tJOHN\n\tSome of us have to get some sleep around \n\there.  What's with that kid?\n\nKara ignores him as her mother, DEBRA, careworn face with \ncompassionate eyes, tries to lend a hand.\n\t\t\n\t\tDEBRA\n\tLet me take him for you, Kara.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tIt's all right, Mom.  Go back to bed.\n\nDebra sighs resignedly.  TIM, 18, stocky and streetwise, wearing \ntorn red sweat pants and \"Ice-T\" t-shirt, casually replaces his \nWalkman headphones and returns to his room.\n\nINT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (A FEW MINUTES LATER)\n\nKara opens the closet and switches on the light.  Satisfying Danny \nthat it's empty, she breaks into her perfunctory routine.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tStay away monters, stay away ghouls. Stay away \n\tfrom Danny.  You jerks know the rules. \n\t   (crossing to Danny's bed)\n\tBetter?\n\nDanny giggles as his pretty young mother tucks him in.\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tMommy, when can we go home?\n\nKara sighs.  They've been through this one before.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tHome is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new \n\thouse.  At least while I'm in college.  \n\tRemember our deal.\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tThe kids at school said this is a haunted \n\thouse -- that a bad man used to live here.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tThey did, did they?  Since when did we start \n\tlistening to the kids at school?\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tBut I've seen him!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tYou've been watching too much TV.\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tHe says things.  Bad things.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tLike what?\n\nDanny is afraid to tell her.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (continuing)\n\tIf you mean the things Grandpa says sometimes, \n\tignore him.  Once he gets to know you he'll \n\tcome around ... Let the bad things you hear \n\tslide right off your back.\n\nKara tousles his blond hair and kisses his forehead.  Then she \ngoes to the closet, just about to turn out the light --\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\t   (sitting up; panicked)\n\tNo, Mom -- keep it on!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tOkay ... But just for tonight.\n\nKara adjusts the closet door, causing one of Danny's school \ndrawings to fly off the wall.  She picks it up on her way out.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (continuing)\n\tGood-night, Danny.\n\nKara softly closes the door.  Danny lies awake, blankets drawn up \nto his chin, eyes wide.  Still very much afraid.\n\nINT. KARA'S ROOM (CONTINUOUS)\n\nKara yawns, removes her glasses and rubs her eyes, setting Danny's \ndrawing on a pile of open books.  Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke \ncans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.\n\nAdjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move \nabout the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the \nsubtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:\n\t\t\n\t\tWOMAN (V.O.)\n\tI know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love \n\thim.  I write to him every week. I think I \n\teven want to have his child --\n\nThe woman is cut off by the nasally, steel-trap voice of HARRY \nSIMMS, talk radio's most popular man of controversy:\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tLet me get this straight, Debi.  Now you're \n\tsaying that not only does this guy get you \n\tsexually aroused, but now you want to bear his \n\toffspring?!\n\nWearing only her bra and panties, Kara moves to a full-length \nmirror and lets down her long, flaxen hair.  Beneath her studious \nexterior, she is quite attractive:  delicate features with an \nenviable, naturally-toned figure.\n\t\t\n\t\tWOMAN (V.O.)\n\tDeep down, he's just like you and me. He just \n\tneeds someone to understand him.  Someone to \n\tlove him.\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tYou're talking about one of this nation's most \n\tnotorious serial killers like he belongs in \n\tsome kind of Est seminar!  What planet have \n\tyou been on, lady?  Michael Myers has been \n\tdead for six years!\n\nA CLICK as the woman is abruptly DISCONNECTED.\n\nKara suddenly whirls around, startled by a FLASH of something -- a \nface -- in the mirror!\n\nDrawn to the window behind her, she rubs off rainy mist and peers \noutside.\n\nKARA'S P.O.V.\n\nof the large Victorian frame house directly across the street.  \nAnother FLASH OF LIGHTNING reveals the shadow of a man standing in \nthe uppermost window -- looking right at her!\n\nANGLE ON KARA\n\nFrightened, her eyes lock on Danny's drawing.  A child's \nscribbling in red Crayon:  The triangular symbol of Thorn!\n\nEXT. MYERS HOUSE / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE\n\nKara draws the priscilla curtains over the window as we PULL BACK \nthrough the pouring RAIN ... toward the house across the street.  \nAn ornate sign on the front door reads:\n\n\"Blankenship House - Rooms Available\"\n\nCRANE UP toward the window where the shadowy figure stands.  An \ninsidious CRASH OF THUNDER as we PUSH through the window.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nA macabre display of old newspaper headlines, arranged \nhelterskelter on a wall:  \"HALLOWEEN KILLS ESCAPES FROM ASYLUM.\"  \n\"HORROR IN HADDONFIELD:  MICHAEL MYERS CLAIMS 16 LIVES.\"  \"REIGN \nOF TERROR ENDS AS MYERS PERISHES IN VIGILANTE EXPLOSION.\"\n\nHarry Simms BOOMS over a state-of-the-art HiFi system.  A cassette \ntape RECORDS the continuing broadcast.\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tNow we've got someone who claims he's actually \n\tseen Michael Myers.  Does this whacko caller \n\thave a name?\n\nStaring out the window at the Myers house, TOMMY DOYLE, a \nstrapping 25-year-old with reddish brown hair and intense eyes, \ncradles a cordless phone.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tMy name's Tommy.  I was only eight- years-old \n\twhen I saw him.  But I was lucky.  I survived.\n\nTommy paces nervously around his sparsely-furnished attic \napartment.  Classic horror movie one-sheets and mint first edition \ncomic books share wall space with a chilling array of guns, \nknives, and survivalist weapons.\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tSounds like you're a candidate for \n\telectroshock therapy, Tommy.  Don't tell me \n\tafter all this time you still believe Myers is \n\talive?!\n\nTommy pauses, mesmerized by one of the newspaper clippings.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tMichael's work isn't finished in Haddonfield.  \n\tNow it's just a matter of time before he comes \n\thome to kill again.  But this time I'll be \n\tready.\n\nMOVE IN TIGHT on the headline, frail and yellowed by age:  \n\"November 1, 1978.  TOMMY DOYLE SURVIVES BABYSITTER BLOODBATH.\"  \nDirectly beneath this:  \"November 3, 1989.  JAMIE LLOYD FEARED \nDEAD IN POLICE STATION MASSACRE.\"\n\nCLOSE ON a photograph of young Jamie and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. DUNGEON - CHAMBER - NIGHT\n\nJamie remains strapped to the table, wrapped in bloody sheets.  \nEyes closed.  Deathly still.  Suddenly an urgent, WHISPERING VOICE \npierces the darkness:\n\t\t\n\t\tWHISPERING VOICE (O.S.)\n\tJamie?  Jamie?!\n\nJamie startles awake to see the midwife frantically releasing her \nstraps.\n\t\t\n\t\tMARY\n\tCome with me if you want to save your baby.\n\nJamie can't believe her eyes.  Mary opens a threadbare knapsack -- \nrevealing the baby inside!\n\nA soul-shuddering RUMBLE echoes throughout the cavern.  Jamie \nleaps up, eyes wide with fear, sensing the evil presence.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tOh, God ... He's coming!\n\t\t\n\t\tMARY\n\tWe've got to move.  Now!\n\nPulsing with adrenaline, Jamie harnesses the knapsack over her \nshoulders and follows Mary out into the tunnels.\n\nTUNNEL GATE\n\nChains GRIND over rusted pulleys.  A massive iron gate rises, \nrevealing a pair of filthy work boots.  Legs planted in bold \nstance as a tall, ominous shape begins to emerge.\n\nANOTHER TUNNEL\n\nThe terrified midwife leads Jamie with her baby on a breathless \nflight through the winding network of tunnels.  Haunted by the \nECHOING SOUNDS of the rising gate.\n\nSTALKING P.O.V. - THROUGH TUNNELS\n\nGliding forward into the hollow catacombs.  Slow by determined.  \nSensing the way.\n\nANOTHER PART OF THE TUNNELS\n\nReaching a corner, Mary stops and sends Jamie off in the opposite \ndirection.\n\t\t\n\t\tMARY\n\tThere!  It's that way!\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tNo --\n\t\t\n\t\tMARY\n\tSave your baby -- go now!\n\nJamie runs, disappearing down the dark tunnel.  Mary quickly \nremoves her shoes and tears off, now SILENT.\n\nSTALKING P.O.V.\n\nsurges around a corner.  FINDS Mary.  MOVES IN on her.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nMary turns in small circles.  Fear mounting as she falters into \ndarkness.  Heavy, labored BREATHING fills the tunnel.\n\nA mask -- the pale, neutral features of a man weirdly distorted by \nthe rubber -- materialized out of the void right behind her.  THE \nSHAPE!\n\nMary turns, about to scream when the Shape lunges out, lifts her \nup by the nape of the neck and SLAMS her forehead into a large \nmetal SPIKE jutting out from the cavern wall!\n\nLeaving her impaled like a fish on a hook, the Shape resumes its \nrelentless pursuit.  Eerie under the lighted torches.\n\nEND OF TUNNEL\n\nJamie runs frantically.  Methodical, heavy FOOTSTEPS behind her.  \nShe chances a look behind.  The Shape is coming!\n\nJamie vaults up a dark stairwell.  A trap door above.  It won't \nbudge.  Jamie frantically POUNDS against the hatch.\n\nThe Shape mounts the stairs!\n\nStrength fueled by sheer desperation, Jamie forces the door open.  \nTumbles onto muddy ground.\n\nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\nJamie drags herself out of the hole and half-runs, half-stumbles \nwith her baby through an ugly, charred forest.  Sharp branches \nwhip at her face.  RAIN falls.  LIGHTNING streaks across the sky.\n\nAs if hell-spawned, the Shape emerges from the underground chamber \nand trudges forward, bold and unstoppable.\n\nJamie tumbles into a gully, nearly dropping the knapsack.  She \npicks herself up, hands groping at rain-sopped earth.  The Shape \nis right behind her!\n\nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - NIGHT (SAME)\n\nA slap-happy, overweight MOTORIST sips coffee from a 7-11 cup, \nstraining to see the road through falling rain and fogged-up \nglasses.  Harry Simms keeps him mindlessly occupied.\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tNext up is Dwayne.  What's on your feeble \n\texcuse for a mind, \"Dwayne?\"\n\nThe Motorisft lets out a hardy GUFFAW, spilling his coffee.\n\t\t\n\t\tMOTORIST\n\tShit!\n\nFingers burning, he searches the glove compartment for a napkin.\n\t\t\n\t\tDWAYNE (V.O.)\n\tI'd just like to say that I listen to your \n\tshow every night, Harry.  I think you're the \n\tbest.  I can't tell you how excited we are \n\tthat you'll be paying a visit to our little \n\ttown tomorrow night.\n\t\t\n\t\tHARRY SIMMS (V.O.)\n\tDo you have a point to make here, Dwayne, or \n\tshould I just keep practicing my wrist \n\texercises?\n\t\t\n\t\tDWAYNE\n\t   (chortles)\n\tHarry, you're too much.  I'd just like to say \n\tthat I understand how things have changed in \n\tthe 90's.  Gays in the military, cut off your \n\thusband's do- jigger, become a national hero.  \n\tBut I just can't see any sense in bringing \n\tHalloween back to Haddonfield.\n\nThe Motorist looks up.  Eyes go wide with panic.  Startled GASP.\n\nP.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD\n\nJamie stands in the middle of the road, SCREAMING bloody-murder.\n\nEXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. PICKUP TRUCK (SAME)\n\nTires SCREECH.  The pickup stops on a dime.  The Motorist just \nsits there, mouth agape as the shrieking girl throws open the door \nand clambers into the passenger seat.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tDrive!  Goddamnit, drive!\n\nThrough his side-view mirror, the unsuspecting Motorist sees the \noutline of a quickly-approaching man.  Unrolling his window, he \nrubbernecks a look outside.\n\t\t\n\t\tMOTORIST\n\tHey, what do you think you're --\n\nCRUNCHING BONE and TEARING FLESH as the Shape's hands shoot \nthrough the window, twisting the man's head off his shoulders!\n\nJamie SCREAMS!  Lunges for the steering wheel.  Slams her foot \ndown hard on the gas.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nThe pickup bullets forward, fishtailing up the road, never slowing \ndown as the driver's door flies open, dumping the motorists's \nheadless bulk into a muddy ditch.\n\nINT. PICKUP (SAME)\n\nJamie drives.  Checks to see that her baby is safe.  Then lets out \na PRIMAL SCREAM.  A hysterical release of fear and rage, drowned \nout by the squabble of VOICES over the radio:\n\t\t\n\t\tMALE CALLER #2 (V.O.)\n\tYou're coming here for this Halloween fair -- \n\tit's all just a game -- a publicity stunt for \n\tyou, isn't it Harry?

What are they \n\tputting in the water in that town?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     CUT TO:\n\nINT. LOOMIS'S CABIN - NIGHT (SAME)\n\nLIGHTNING FLASHES and RAIN pelts the windows of a bucolic cabin.  \nThis is a man's retreat and has been for years.  Dark wood, worn \nleather, a few tastefully-chosen antiques.  Floor-to-floor ceiling \nshelves containing a myriad of books and an impressive display of \nawards and degrees, all bearing the name:  SAMUEL J. LOOMIS, Ph.D.\n\nAfter a STATION IDENTIFICATION, \"The Harry Simms Show\" resumes, \ntinny-voiced CALLERS blaring over a handsomely-restored 1928 \nBremer-Tully.\n\t\t\n\t\tMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)\n\tAll these fanatics aside, Harry, I'd \n\tpersonally like to thank whoever did the \n\tmasked one in.  Saved us tax-payers a lot of \n\tmoney in the long run.\n\t\t\n\t\tFEMALE CALLER #3 (V.O.)\n\tYeah, that sucker's been dead for six years.  \n\tIt's about time they had a Halloween revival \n\tin this town.  Now my kids can stop driving me \n\tcrazy!\n\nMOVE IN behind a bald, sharp-featured man, hunched over a can as \nhe reminisces over a collection of framed photographs -- memories \nof his wife and children.\n\t\t\n\t\tMALE CALLER #4 (V.O.)\n\tWhat happened to that psychiatrist of his?  \n\tLoomis, I think was his name.  I heard the old \n\tquack was dead.\n\nTurning at the mention of his name is DR. LOOMIS himself, wearing \nspectacles, a comfortable sweater and his trademark goatee.

A \npumpking patch.\n\nThe van reappears in a glare of headlights.  Its engine screaming \nwith fire-breathing rage.\n\nThe pickup puts on a furious burst of speed.  Eating up pumpkins and \nspinning out chunks of splattering seeds and pulp.\n\nThe van bears down hard, slingshotting across the field, whizzing \npast the pickup, cutting right in front of it.\n\nINT.

Like a phantom in the \nnight, the van is gone.  The Shape nowhere to be seen.\n\nSteam billows from the pickup, engine TICKING, a heap of shattered \nglass and mangled steel.  Pinned against the base of the tree is a \nshape in human form -- a scarecrow!\n\nMOVE IN on Jamie, face-down against the steering wheel.  Coughing on \nthe noxious fumes, she stirs back to life.  Slowly, painfully, she \nshoulders the door.  Falls onto the ground.\n\nA SPARK ignites.  BLINDING FLASH as the gas tank EXPLODES, setting \nthe truck ablaze.  Jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror.  \nDebris rains down on her.\n\nSuddenly a grim shadow rises from the field.  The Shape -- wielding \nan enormous butcher knife!\n\nJamie rolls onto her back, SCREAMING.\n\t\t\n\t\tJAMIE\n\tNo -- NO!!!\n\nSuddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible THUD.\n\nINT.

Puffing on a \ncigarette, wearing slippers and a flimsy bath robe, John raises a \nlarge axe.\n\nA group of neighborhood KIDS -- some dressed in Halloween \ncostumes -- stand a safe distance away.  Gathered on the sidewalk.  \nGawking, whispering, tittering.\n\nJohn angrily swings the axe into the signpost.  The kids jump with a \ncollective start.\n\t\t\n\t\tJOHN\n\tEnough ... \n\t   (one CHOP)\n\t... of this ... \n\t   (two CHOPS)\n\t...

Uttering oaths under his breath.\n\nBOOM UP over the surrounding neighborheed.  SUPERIMPOSE:\n\n\"Haddonfield, Illinois.

It's about being political.  \n\tThere are too many people with corn-cobs up \n\ttheir ass in this town telling us what we can \n\tand can't do.

Supposedly some scary \n\tshit happened to him when he was a kid.  Messed \n\tup his head.  He's harmless, though.

Narrowly avoiding a collision.\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\tSpeed kills, asshole!\n\nSuddenly the van swerves around to face the VW head on.  For a \nbreathless moment the van and the VW sit at opposite ends of the \nintersection.  Idling.  A tense stand-off.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tWho is that ...\n\nKara strains to get a look at the van's driver.  A momentary glimpse \nof a pale white face behind the wheel.\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\t   (bravely)\n\tI've got my pepper spray.\n\nDanny sits frozen in the back seat.  Suddenly the van shoots \nforward, tires SCREAMING.  Startled GASPS.

LADIES' ROOM (CONTINUOUS)\n\nTommy walks past the sink.  Water drips into the filthy basin.  He \ntouches something inside, rubs it on his fingers -- blood.\n\nTommy whirls, startled by a sudden NOISE.  Muffled, indistinct.  \nLike CRYING.  Tommy gathers his courage as he slowly moves past the \nlong row of empty stalls.  The CRIES grow louder as he reaches the \nfinal stall.  Jamie's escape route -- the window -- still wide open.\n\nA hole in the wall behind the toilet.  Tommy reaches in, his hands \nlocking onto something.  Shock and amazement overcome him when he \nlifts out a baby -- Jamie's baby.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tJesus ...\n\nThe helpless newborn kicks and CRIES, the triangular symbol of Thorn \nstill caked in blood over his tiny torso.\n\nSUBJECTIVE P.O.V.\n\nSomeone partially opens the door, peering in from the hallway as \nTommy removes his jacket and bundles the baby inside.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tOkay, little guy.

A charred body is lifted from the \neviscerated, flame-blackened pikcup truck.\n\nA few feet away, a team of PARAMEDICS work frantically around \nanother body, hidden among a cluster of pumpkins.\n\nLoomis surges forward, at once halted by an armed DEPUTY.\n\n\t\tDEPUTY\n\tSir, you'll have to step back.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tPlease.

She picks it up, startled by what she sees.\n\nKARA'S P.O.V. - THE DRAWING\n\nCrayola figures of Grandma, Grandpa, Uncle Tim, and Mommy.  Knives \npiercing them.  Blood dripping.  Mouths screaming.  A black shadow \nfigure bearing the word \"THORN.\"\n\nOn the flip side, the drawing she found last night.  Danny's \nscribbling of the odd triangular symbol.\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nThe horrifying images send chills up Kara's spine.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tThorn ...\n\nLost in grim reverie, Kara walks on, oblivious to the activity all \naround her ...\n\nA banner hangs from the eaves of the library:  \"HADDONFIELD JR. \nCOLLEGE - FIRST ANNUAL HARVEST FAIRE.\"\n\nTim and Beth supervise as preparations for tonight's event get \nunderway.\n\nSTUDENT VOLUNTEERS nailing together booths, hanging decorations.  A \nhalf-assembled Ferris wheel, a merry-go-round, an ominous-looking \nHouse of Horrors.\n\nRounding the corner onto the quiet path behind the library, Kara \nsuddenly finds herself alone.  WIND whips at her hair.  She glances \nover her shoulder, as if sensing a presence.\n\nKARA'S P.O.V.\n\nNo one is there.

John SCREAMS as the Shape grabs \nhim by the neck, lifts him off the floor with one hand, then carries \nhim across the basement and SLAMS him brutally against the open fuse \nbox.\n\nThe Shape's free hand lifts an enormous butcher knife.

Beth sits up nervously.\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\tAren't you gonna answer that?\n\t\t\n\t\tTIM\n\tAnswer what?\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\t   (fends him off)\n\tWhat if it's Kara?\n\nFrustrated, Tim jumps off the bed and stomps into the bathroom, \ntaking a candle with him.\n\t\t\n\t\tTIM\n\tFine.  You answer it.  I'll make friends with my soap on a \n\trope.\n\nTim slams the door.  Beth deliberates her move, then goes to pick \nup the phone.\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\t   (into phone)\n\tHello?\n\nINT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nKara is frantic.  Looking out the window at the Myers house.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (into phone)\n\tMom -- Who is this?\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH (V.O.)\n\tKara? ... No, this is Beth.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tWhat are you doing there?  Where's my mother?\n\nINT.

Tim waits for the running shower to \nwarm up as he does a bare-ass jig over to the sink.\n\nRinsing off his tooth brush, he elbows out a circle of steam from \nthe mirror.  He gasps.  The Shape is standing right behind him!\n\nBefore he can react, Tim's head is yanked backwards.  The chilling \nSNAP of his neck is punctuated by a CRASH OF THUNDER.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nKara can SEE Beth on the phone.  Sitting by the window.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tI'm across the street.  I can see you. Beth, I want you to \n\tlisten to me.  Get Tim and get out of that house.  Right \n\tnow.\n\nUnnoticed by Kara, Danny rises and crosses the room.  Drawn toward \nthe door by the irascible voice.\n\t\t\n\t\tWHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)\n\tCome to me, Danny ... Come to me.\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM\n\nBeth shifts nervously, looking out across the way at Kara.\n\nTHUNDER drowns out the sound of the bathroom door CREAKING open.  The \nShape advances.\n\t\t\n\t\tBETH\n\tKara, what the hell is going on?\n\nINT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nKara's mouth suddenly drops open.  Her mind snaps into sensory overload.  \nShe can see the Shape walking up behind Beth!  Raising a gleaming \nbutcher knife!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tBeth, look out!  There's someone in the room!  He's right \n\tbehind you!\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM\n\nBeth drops the phone, eyes bulging as the Shape plunges the knife \ninto her back.  She falls, CRASHING against the vanity.\n\nBeth SCREAMS unholy terror.  But the Shape isn't through.\n\nINT. TOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nKara stands frozen in pure horror, hearing and seeing her friend's \nvicious murder.\n\nHer eyes shoot down.  A little blond-haired boy is walking steadily \nacross the street toward the Myers house.\n\nNo, it can't be true.  Kara wheels around.  Danny is gone.\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - KARA'S BEDROOM - ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW\n\nDanny can be seen below walking toward the house as Beth's \nblood-gurgling SCREAMS fill the room.  The knife repeatedly, \nmercilessly SLASHING down at her.\n\nEXT. STREET / MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nKara bolts out of the Blankenship house and races across the street, \nchasing after Danny through RAIN and LIGHTNING.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, no!!!\n\nKARA'S P.O.V. - FOLLOWING DANNY\n\nHe glides up the porch steps and slips through the front door of the \nMyers house.  Disappearing inside.\n\nKARA\n\nshoots across the lawn.  Up the porch steps.  Right behind him.\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - FOYER\n\nKara dives through the front door.  THUNDER shatters the house.  \nEverything is frighteningly dark.  Shockingly quiet.\n\nInch by inch, she makes her way inside.  Eyes wide.  Savage.  \nShaking uncontrollably.  A CRASHING SOUND behind her.  She jumps out \nof her skin.  Just the door SLAMMING shut in the WIND.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (the faintest whisper)\n\tDanny?\n\nShe advances into the hall.  Old floorboards CREAK beneath her feet.  \nSOUNDS up ahead.  FOOTSTEPS.\n\nKara looks up.  LIGHTNING FLASHES.  Danny is nearing the top of the \nstairs!\n\nInstinct propels her up the stairs after him.  Then suddenly she stops \ndead.  Reason taking over.  And she turns back.\n\nPicks up a fireplace poker sitting in the corner.  Then she heads back \nup the stairs.  Mind-blown with horror.\n\nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\nKara reaches the top of the staircase, looking down the dark hallway.  \nSummoning all of her courage, she moves forward.\n\nSuddenly Danny darts out from the adjacent hall and disappears inside \nhis bedroom -- a fleeting, ghostly image.  Kara startles.  Follows him \ninside.\n\nDANNY'S BEDROOM\n\nDanny stands in a corner.  LIGHTNING illuminates his toy dinosaurs.  \nKara goes to him, takes his hand.  He resists her.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (intense whisper)\n\tCome on ... Danny, please.\n\nShe picks him up, carries him toward the door.  LUMBERING FOOTSTEPS.  \nKara stands paralyzed in the doorway as the Shape stalks down the hall.  \nEyes probing.  Walking right past them.\n\nDANNY'S BEDROOM\n\nKara slips silently back into the room, carrying Danny through the \nbathroom.  Adjoining on the opposite side into\n\nKARA'S ROOM\n\nLIGHTNING CRACKLES.  The walls are covered with blood.  Kara stumbles \nover something on the floor.  Cranes her neck to look down.\n\nBeth's bloody, mangled remains at her feet.\n\nShock waves send Kara reeling backwards against the open bathroom door.  \nHanging on a hook is Tim's naked body, eyes open, staring at her in a \nhorrified rictus of death.\n\nKara SCREAMS.  Drops Danny.  Quickly covers her mouth.  Realizing that \nshe's given them away.\n\nSuddenly the bedroom door tears open, buckling off its hinges.  The \nShape bulldozes in, wielding its huge butcher knife!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, run!!!\n\nDanny ducks into the hall, evading the Shape's lurching hands.\n\nDANNY\n\ncareens down the stairs.  THUNDER RAGES.\n\nKARA\n\nbrandishes the fireplace poker at the killer.  The Shape moves in, \nbacking her through the bathroom ... into Danny's room.  Suddenly \nshe SLAMS the door on the Shape.\n\nKara tears off into the hallway.  Turns.  Waiting for the Shape to \nappear.  It doesn't.\n\nKara vacillates down the hall.  Jumping at every sound.  Training her \nweapon at things unseen.  SLAMMING doors along the way, sealing off \nevery passageway as she tries to find her way through the impenetrable \ndark tunnel.\n\nSuddenly something CRASHES down from above.  Kara's mother, strung up on \na bloody sheet, dangling upside-down from the trap door in the ceiling! \nThe axe still protruding from her chest.\n\nANOTHER ANGLE\n\nKara SCREAMS, shrinking away from the gruesome sight, faltering through \nthe blackened doorway behind her.  An unbearable moment of tension as we \nthink the Shape's mask will be there.\n\nSuddenly the Shape shoots up directly in front of her!  Tearing the \ndangling corpse from the sheet, dislodging the axe from Debra's chest \nwith a repulsive SQUISH.\n\nKara wheels toward the stairs.  The Shape advances.  Swings the axe.  \nMisses her by inches.  Kara ducks, lurches behind the Shape.  Swings \nthe fireplace poker with everything she's got.  CRACKING it full-force \nover the back of the Shape's head.\n\nThe Shape breaks through the banister and plunges off the landing, \nSLAMMING hard onto the floor below.\n\nTerrified, Kara chances a look down.  The Shape doesn't move.\n\nEXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - NIGHT (SAME)\n\nTommy's Explorer skids to a stop outside the boarding house.  Loomis and \nTommy fly up the front path.  Tommy glances back at the blackened Myers \nhouse for a moment, then follows Loomis inside.\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY (SAME)\n\nKara barrels off the stairs.  Moves cautiously past the Shape.  Sprawled \nface-up in the middle of the hall.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nKara searches for Danny, keeping her eyes trained on the Shape.  The \nlittle boy appears in the doorway directly across the hall.\n\nThe Shape lying in between them.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, come to Mommy.\n\nDanny shakes his head.  Too frightened to move.\n\nHALLWAY / FOYER\n\nEver so slowly, Kara moves toward the threshold.  Hefting the fireplace \npoker, she steps right over the Shape.\n\nInstantly she snatches Danny up in her arms.  Takes one step forward when \nsuddenly --\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tMommy!!!\n\nThe Shape springs up, twisting Kara's ankle.  She falls, splaying forward.  \nThe Shape claws at her leg.  Kara fights back, kicking herself free of the \nvice-like grip.\n\nScrambling to her feet, Kara rockets Danny through the foyer to the front \ndoor -- desperately trying to escape from this real-life house of horrors \n-- only to find that it is locked.\n\nThe Shape rises, gleaming butcher knife in hand.\n\nKara twists the deadbolt, but someone's secured the chain lock!  Too late \nto remove it.  The Shape is right behind them.\n\nOnly one way to go.  The cellar.  Kara shoves Danny through.\n\nINT. CELLAR (CONTINUOUS)\n\nKara and Danny clatter down the rickety stairs and SPLASH across the flooded \nbasement floor.\n\nA soul-shuddering POUNDING on the door above.\n\nKara ushers Danny toward the elevated window.\n\nThe cellar door EXPLODES, the Shape's hand breaking through, splintering \nthe wood as if it were paper.\n\nKara HEARS the Shape moving rapidly down the stairs.  Lifts Danny up the \nwall toward the window.  But it's not a wall -- it's John's electrocuted \nbody, propped inside a storage cabinet!\n\nDanny SHRIEKS, staring into John's lifeless eyes.  Kara pushes him up.  \nDanny reaches for the lock.  Just an inch away.\n\nKara can't lift him any higher.  The Shape is coming!\n\nDanny hoists himself up just enough to twist the lock.  He pushes the \nwindow open and clambers outside.\n\nKara scrambles up old pressboard shelves.  They break under her weight; \nshe topples back to the floor.\n\nThe Shape wades toward her.  Reaching up for the window.\n\nEXT. MYERS HOUSE - BASEMENT WINDOW\n\nDanny watches his mother struggle to climb out of the crypt.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, help me!\n\nKara's hand reaches toward him.  Danny makes no movement.\n\t\t\n\t\tWHISPERING VOICE (V.O.)\n\tCome to me, Danny ... Come to me.\n\nDanny obediently turns and starts to walk away.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny!!!\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR\n\nKara's foot falls on the handle of the knife jutting from her father's \nchest.  Uses it to springboard herself half-way through the window.  \nClawing at wet grass.\n\nThe Shape's hand shoots out of the darkness below, grabbing at her legs.  \nKara writhes, kicking and SCREAMING.\n\nEXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW\n\nKara grabs chunks of mud as she is pulled back through the window.  The \nShape yanks hard.  Kara catches herself on the window frame.  Quickly \nlosing her grip.\n\nINT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR\n\nThe knife swipes downward, swiping her ankle.\n\nEXT. MYERS HOUSE - CELLAR WINDOW\n\nKara reacts to the searing pain, releasing her grip on the window frame.  \nSuddenly Danny appears, locking onto her collar, pulling her clear in one \nmassive heave.\n\nKara shuffles across the ground and picks herself up.  Grabs Danny's hand \nand runs full-tilt around the side of the house.\n\nEXT. STREET / BLANKENSHIP HOUSE\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS their frenzied flight across the street.  Past Tommy's \nExplorer.  Kara limping.  Danny surging toward the Blankenship house.  Kara \nSCREAMS, pounding frantically on the door.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tPlease!  Open the door!\n\nINT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - TOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nTommy and Loomis have turned the apartment upside-down.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tThe baby -- where's the baby?!\n\nSuddenly they HEAR Kara's frantic pleas outside.  Tommy bolts out the door.\nLoomis right behind him.\n\nEXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)\n\nKara POUNDS furiously.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tPlease!  Somebody help us!\n\nDanny huddles beside her, peering out across the street.\n\nDANNY'S P.O.V. - MYERS HOUSE\n\nThe Shape trudges boldly down the porch steps -- knife in hand!\n\nBACK TO SCENE\n\nKara sees the Shape -- walking slowly and deliberately toward them.  Her \nSCREAMS become even more intense.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tHelp us please!!!\n\nThe Shape closes in.  At the last second, Tommy throws open the door.  Kara \nand Danny tumble inside.  Into his arms.\n\nINT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE - LOBBY / PARLOR (CONTINUOUS)\n\nLoomis slams and deadbolts the door.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tGet them upstairs.  Now!\n\nKara pounds against Tommy's chest.  Hysterical.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tWhere's the baby?!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tHe's gone.\n\nKara holds Danny close to her side, backing away in horror as Tommy and \nLoomis go around the parlor, securing the doors and windows.  THUNDER RIPS \nthrough the darkened room.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\t   (continuing)\n\tWho else knew I had the baby?!\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tNo one.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tNo -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tOnly me -- \n\t   (dark realization)\n\t-- and Dr. Wynn.\n\nSuddenly the window behind Kara EXPLODES.  She SCREAMS, recoiling.  Then \nthe window in front of her.  HANDS reach through.  Tommy shoves her out of \nthe way.\n\nANOTHER HAND shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, \ntwists open the lock.\n\nDanny races across the lobby and up the stairs.\n\nRobed figures fill the doorways.  Climbing through windows.  Moving inside \nthe house.  Surrounding Loomis.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\t   (continuing)\n\tWynn!!!\n\nThe robed figures descend on Loomis.  Drops his .357.  Tommy lurches for it, \nto no avail.  Loomis's SCREAM fills the darkness like a fever dream.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\t   (continuing)\n\tRun, Tommy!!!  Run!!!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tNo!!!\n\nTommy backpedals up the stairs.  Kara pulling him along as the cloaked \nfigures glow toward them.  Daggers raised.\n\nUPSTAIRS HALLWAY\n\nKara reacts to the SOUND of Danny's VOICE.\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tMommy!  Please help me!\n\nKara rushes through darkness to find him.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny!  Danny, where are you?!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tKara, no!\n\nKara trips and falls.  A pair of silver-tipped black boots planted in \nbold stance.  Slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the \ngloved hand of the nefarious Stranger -- Dr. Wynn!  Danny stands by his \nside, staring dispassionately.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, no ... please ...\n\nKara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering \nback down the hallway.\n\nShe turns to see the black figures overtaking Tommy.  His SCREAMS \nswallowed by hollow darkness.\n\nAlone, Kara careens through another doorway into\n\nTOMMY'S APARTMENT\n\nKara slams the door, turns in desperate circles.\n\nStepping out from behind the door is Mrs. Blankenship -- the baby bundled \nin her arms!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tMrs. Blankenship -- Oh, God -- Hurry. We have to --\n\nAs Kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger.  Her eyes \nburning.  Her wrist branded with the mark of Thorn!\n\nKara SCREAMS.  The old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to \nenter the room.  Daggers drawn.  CHANTING a dark invocation.\n\nThe coven forces Kara backwards.  Nowhere to run.  Nowhere to hide.\n\nSuddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the \nwindow!\n\nEXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)\n\nDefenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing \noff the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A \nthousand grass fragments raining down on her.\n\nKARA\n\nlies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent \nrepose.  She doesn't move.\n\nTHE HOUSE\n\nis still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\nKARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS\n\nA ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.\n\nSuddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers \nacross dank walls.\n\nKARA\n\nis being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's \nmercy.\n\nTOMMY\n\nis wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and \nbruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into \ndarkness.\n\nEXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT\n\nLIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up \nto the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  \"SMITH'S GROVE - \nWARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM.\"\n\nThe main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.\n\nTHE VAN\n\npulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny \nsteps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  \nLeading him toward the entrance.\n\nLANDING FIELD\n\nThe helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides \ntoward the building.\n\nINT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\nFOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to \nBUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.\n\nThrough tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.\n\nEXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA\n\nDawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.\n\t\t\n\t\tDAWN\n\tGood evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting \n\tinside.\n\nWynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn \nresumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.\n\nINT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nWynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over \nto where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across \nhis forehead.\n\nSeeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tWhat is this all about?  Remove those!\n\nThe guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tWhere's the child?\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tSam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday \n\thappily retired, today right back in the thick of things. \n\tSomehow I knew you still had it in you.\n\nLoomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's \nhand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tCome now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know \n\thow difficult this must be for you -- a man of your \n\tupbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I \n\tfelt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. \n\t   (gestures to his staff)\n\tAfter all, you're the only one around here who's still in \n\tthe dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell \n\tyou, but you've really given me no other choice.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tThis is madness, Wynn.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tYour madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way \n\tthings have always been.  You've just been too blinded by \n\tyour own reality to see. \n\t   (beat)\n\tBut having you on the outside has been convenient for us in \n\tmany ways. \n\t   (smiles)\n\tYou always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  \n\tFinding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his \n\twork.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last \n\ttime, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible \n\ttime we had getting him out of that jail cell.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tIt was you.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (lights a cigarette)\n\tSometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tWhy did you take Jamie?\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tShe has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her \n\tveins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I \n\tincubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has \n\tserved his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tJamie's baby ...\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tThere you go trying to make sense again. \n\t   (grimly entranced)\n\tIt's a curse.

I follow it.  Protect it.  \n\tAct as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.\n\nLoomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tI know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so \n\tmuch more for you to try to make sense of.\n\nLoomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and \nhis white coats flow out behind him.\n\nINT. CELL - NIGHT\n\nA tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude \nmetal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.\n\nFeverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through \nskin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.\n\nINT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n\nA group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service \nelevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, \nsurveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back \npocket.\n\nAs they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  \nTommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along \nthe dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.\n\nWynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.\n\nINT. CATWALK (SAME)\n\nLoomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  \nThe Shape lies inside.  Dormant.\n\nWynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tLook at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I \n\ttell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.\n\nWynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Rise.\n\nBelow, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Pain.\n\nWynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, \nsucking the bleeding gash.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Kill.\n\nSuddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- \ninside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified \nSCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.\n\nLoomis closes his eyes in anguish.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tYou've created a monster.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tAmazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.\n\nWynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tWe're not the only ones, you know. There are many \n\tbelievers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be \n\tamazed to know how far it reaches.\n\nINT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER\n\nA metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, \npocketing the key card.\n\nA storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of \nthem open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.\n\nA small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tHoly shit ...\n\nTommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a \ncartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.\n\nINT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nA large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a \nprimitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her \nhead adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.\n\nA wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of \nreverence.\n\nBehind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.\n\nLoomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to \nthe altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.\n\nThe CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At \nWynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient \nresponse, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.\n\nWe recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. \nBonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  \nPeople from all walks of life.\n\nFaces glazed with sadistic rapture.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (prophetically)\n\tBehind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of \n\tthe heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our \n\tgreat Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.\n\nJamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn \nbeside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- \netched with symbolic runes.\n\nINT. TUNNELS\n\nLetting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  \nToward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.\n\nCEREMONIAL ROOM\n\nThe coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the \ninfant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in \nthe air with an ornate dagger.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tSpirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this \n\tritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of \n\tDarkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and \n\tshow us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of \n\tInnocent Blood.\n\nSuddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless \npools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny!!!\n\nLoomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.\n\nCATWALK\n\nTommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the \nevil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  \nThe Shape's cell being opened.\n\nCEREMONIAL ROOM\n\nThe Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  \nHypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror \nas he raises a gleaming dagger.\n\nWynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.\nAbove the baby.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tStrong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon \n\tthee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy \n\tDarkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.\n\nDanny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING \ninfant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (continuing)\n\tKill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.\n\nKara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tMichael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, \n\tdon't you?\n\nThe Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  \nReminded of his mother.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\t   (continuing)\n\tRemember what he did to you that night. What his voice told \n\tyou to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice \n\tforever.\n\nDanny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tKill him, Danny.  Kill him!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!\n\nDanny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tKill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!\n\nSuddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an \nenraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!\n\nWynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn \nstaggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.\n\nRAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage \nof bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,\nretreating into the tunnels.\n\nLoomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the \ndagger.\n\nKara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The \naltar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.\n\nWynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH \ndown from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.\n\nThe Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames \nlapping at its back.\n\nLoomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, \na dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tNo!!!\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\tStay away, Sam.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tLeave the boy.  Take me.\n\nLoomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.\n\nTommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to \nanticipate Wynn's move.\n\t\t\n\t\tWYNN\n\t   (smiles trenchantly)\n\tGood-bye, Dr. Loomis.\n\nLoomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, \nswiping the dagger across his chest!\n\nWynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.\n\t\t\n\t\tDANNY\n\tMommy!!!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tDanny!!!\n\nTommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just \nas it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.\n\nThe Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the \ncrushed altar.\n\nTommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --\n\nThe Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, \nbacking away, propelling them out into the tunnels.\n\nThe Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.\n\nTUNNELS\n\nTommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.\n\nLOOMIS\n\npainfully crawls away.\n\t\t\n\t\tLOOMIS\n\tDie, Michael.  In the name of God, die!\n\nEND OF TUNNEL\n\nTommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the \nelevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps \ntoward them.\n\nTHE SHAPE\n\nglides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  \nUnstoppable.  Hell-spawned.\n\nEND OF TUNNEL\n\nFinally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until \nthe doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR\n\nKara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and \nGRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.\n\nINT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR\n\nThey barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\tThis way!\n\nTommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. \nThe indicator light shows it moving down.\n\nThey reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tWhat now?!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\t   (realization)\n\tWait a minute ...\n\nHe reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!\n\nSuddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally \nengulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the \nflames as it walks after them.\n\nTommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  \nThe Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.\n\nThey race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape \nwalks through!\n\nTommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step \nahead of the Shape.\n\nThe third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tCome on!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\t   (tries it again)\n\tIt's not working!\n\nThe Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!\n\t\t\n\t\tTOMMY\n\t   (continuing)\n\tSomeone's controlling it!\n\nINT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)\n\nStanding behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. \nWynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides \nquickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.\n\nOn the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost \nbe heard on the silent monitor.\n\nINT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)\n\nKara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the \ncorner, protecting the baby.\n\nEXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)\n\nWynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  \nGetting ready for take-off as they duck inside.\n\nINT. SECURITY CAGE\n\nThe Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then \nturns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.\n\nINT. WYNN'S OFFICE\n\nA hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire \nround into the security console.  Destroying it.\n\nThe man holding the gun is Loomis.\n\nINT. SECURITY CAGE\n\nThe door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door \nshut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.\n\nThe Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.\n\nEXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD\n\nTommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  \nSuddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.\n\nKara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears \ninto the gloom-filled night.\n\nTommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white \nvan.\n\nINT. VAN (SAME)\n\nKara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face \nbruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.\n\nKara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.\n\t\t\n\t\tKARA\n\tHow will we ever find him?\n\nTommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the \nsanitarium gate.\n\nKara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.\n\nIn the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in \nthe darkness.  Emerging.\n\nKara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     FADE OUT.\n\nROLL FINAL CREDITS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Daniel Farrands\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:24.296940"}
