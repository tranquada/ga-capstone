Plunging deeper into this hellish maze.\n\nA door is SLAMMED.  Wooden.  Heavy.  Muffling the SCREAMS.\n\nSpurs CLANK on a pair of silver-tipped cowboy boots as a \nMYSTERIOUS STRANGER steps into VIEW.  Long black duster.  \nWidebrimmed fedora.

A jail cell blown \n     to oblivion.  FIRESTORM rages.  The MYSTERIOUS STRANGER appears, \n     opening fire with a SEMI-AUTOMATIC RIFLE.\n\nPitiful wails of death.

Invoking a dark spell.\n\nMARY, the young midwife, peers around a corner.  Eyes glazed with \nhorror.  Watching.  Spying.\n\nThe newborn SCREAMS.  The flattened blade of a dagger smears a \ntriangular symbol in blood over the baby's torso.\n\nWe MOVE IN on this symbol, capturing it in FREEZE FRAME.  It burns \noff into fiery cinders, disintegrating into DARKNESS.\n\nSilence.

Shaking.  \nPetrified.\n\n<b>DANNY'S P.O.V.\n</b>\nThe THUNDER seems to ROAR from the ferocious jaws of T-REX -- a \n24\" scale model posing on a shelf among an army of Jurassic \nmonsters.

Cliffs Notes and Diet Coke \ncans.  Telltale signs of a late-night cram session.\n\nAdjusting the dial on her FM/alarm clock, Kara begins to move \nabout the little room, slipping out of her clothes as the \nsubtly-seductive voice of a WOMAN comes over the radio:\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWOMAN (V.O.)\n</b>\tI know this sounds crazy, Harry, but I love \n\thim.

Nowhere to hide.\n\nSuddenly Kara makes a decision -- and takes a running leap toward the \nwindow!\n\n<b>EXT. BLANKENSHIP HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\nDefenestrating herself, Kara SCREAMS, tumbling through the air, bouncing \noff the porch overhang before plunging to the front lawn below.  A \nthousand grass fragments raining down on her.\n\n<b>KARA\n</b>\nlies on her back, eyes close, hands folded over her chest in silent \nrepose.  She doesn't move.\n\n<b>THE HOUSE\n</b>\nis still.  Unearthly silence fills the cold October night.\n<b>\t\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t     SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>KARA'S P.O.V. - DISTORTED - INT. TUNNELS\n</b>\nA ring of faceless figures move in, completely surrounding her.\n\nSuddenly the feeling of RAPID MOVEMENT.  Glowing torchlight flickers \nacross dank walls.\n\n<b>KARA\n</b>\nis being pushed forward on a gurney.  Strapped down.  SCREAMING for God's \nmercy.\n\n<b>TOMMY\n</b>\nis wheeled through another tunnel.  His face a mass of bloody cuts and \nbruises.  His eyes glazed over, trying to find focus.  SLAMMING into \ndarkness.\n\n<b>EXT. SANITARIUM - NIGHT\n</b>\nLIGHTNING illuminates the cold, forbidding asylum.  The white van pulls up \nto the security gate.  Headlights illuminate the sign:  \"SMITH'S GROVE - \n<b>WARREN COUNTY SANITARIUM.\"\n</b>\nThe main gate cranks open.  The van pulls through.\n\n<b>THE VAN\n</b>\npulls to a stop near the main building.  The door slides open and Danny \nsteps out, surrounded by Smith's Grove staff wearing white jackets.  \nLeading him toward the entrance.\n\n<b>LANDING FIELD\n</b>\nThe helicopter touches down.  Wynn ducks out, moving in long, even strides \ntoward the building.\n\n<b>INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n</b>\nFOLLOW Wynn through the series of security cages, using his key card to \nBUZZ through.  White coats bringing up the rear.\n\nThrough tall mahogany doors, they cross purposefully into the adjacent wing.\n\n<b>EXECUTIVE RECEPTION AREA\n</b>\nDawn, Wynn's efficient secretary, rises with a congenial smile.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tDAWN\n</b>\tGood evening, Dr. Wynn.  Your -- appointment is waiting \n\tinside.\n\nWynn picks up his messages, then heads straight into the office.  Dawn \nresumes her typing.  Something eerie in her grin.\n\n<b>INT. WYNN'S OFFICE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\nWynn and his staff file inside.  Removing his hat and duster, he walks over \nto where Loomis is seated -- shackled to a chair, a bloody slash across \nhis forehead.\n\nSeeing this, Wynn snaps angrily at two burly GUARDS.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tWhat is this all about?  Remove those!\n\nThe guards comply.  Loomis rubs his aching wrists, glowering.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tWhere's the child?\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tSam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday \n\thappily retired, today right back in the thick of things. \n\tSomehow I knew you still had it in you.\n\nLoomis sees his .357 resting atop Wynn's desk -- only inches away.  Wynn's \nhand covers it, slips it inside the top drawer.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tCome now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know \n\thow difficult this must be for you -- a man of your \n\tupbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I \n\tfelt it was only fair that you finally know the truth. \n\t   (gestures to his staff)\n\tAfter all, you're the only one around here who's still in \n\tthe dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell \n\tyou, but you've really given me no other choice.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tThis is madness, Wynn.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tYour madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way \n\tthings have always been.  You've just been too blinded by \n\tyour own reality to see. \n\t   (beat)\n\tBut having you on the outside has been convenient for us in \n\tmany ways. \n\t   (smiles)\n\tYou always did come through -- our loyal watch dog.  \n\tFinding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his \n\twork.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last \n\ttime, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible \n\ttime we had getting him out of that jail cell.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tIt was you.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (lights a cigarette)\n\tSometimes a cigar is just a cigar.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tWhy did you take Jamie?\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tShe has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her \n\tveins.

And soon we will have a new progeny.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tJamie's baby ...\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tThere you go trying to make sense again. \n\t   (grimly entranced)\n\tIt's a curse.

In a sense, Sam, so do you.\n\nLoomis shudders, rocked by these revelations.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tI know you have more questions, my friend, and there's so \n\tmuch more for you to try to make sense of.\n\nLoomis is hoisted out of his chair and led out of the office.  Wynn and \nhis white coats flow out behind him.\n\n<b>INT. CELL - NIGHT\n</b>\nA tight, damp, claustrophobic space.  Tommy is strapped upright to a crude \nmetal rack, not unlike the one Jamie was bound to the night before.\n\nFeverishly he rubs his wrists against a jagged metal edge, cutting through \nskin, wearing away his bonds.  Breaking through.\n\n<b>INT. TUNNELS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)\n</b>\nA group of white coats, led by Wynn, usher Loomis off an old service \nelevator, leading him through the dark passageway.  Wynn turns around, \nsurveying the tunnel.  As he walks on, we SEE something fall from his back \npocket.\n\nAs they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly CREAKS open.  \nTommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs.  Edging along \nthe dank, torch-lit walls.  WIND MOANS.  Rats scamper past his feet.\n\nWynn has dropped his security key card.  Tommy swipes it.\n\n<b>INT. CATWALK (SAME)\n</b>\nLoomis is led across a narrow precipice overlooking a filthy prison cell.  \nThe Shape lies inside.  Dormant.\n\nWynn stares down hypnotically at his most prized possession.  Michael Myers.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tLook at him.  So silent, yet so deadly. He moves when I \n\ttell him to.  Act on my impulses.  Feels what I feel.\n\nWynn demonstrates.  Loomis looks on, spellbound.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Rise.\n\nBelow, the Shape slowly rises.  Wynn takes out his trusted switchblade.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Pain.\n\nWynn cuts his hand.  The Shape grabs his own hand in agony.  Wynn smiles, \nsucking the bleeding gash.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tMichael -- Kill.\n\nSuddenly Wynn whirls around, throwing Dawn -- his faithful secretary -- \ninside the Shape's pit.  Wynn watches with hideous delight as her horrified \nSCREAMS trail away into blood-gurgling SILENCE.\n\nLoomis closes his eyes in anguish.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tYou've created a monster.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tAmazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.\n\nWynn carries on without remorse.  Loomis is brutally shoved forward.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tWe're not the only ones, you know. There are many \n\tbelievers -- generous contributors to our church.  You'd be \n\tamazed to know how far it reaches.\n\n<b>INT. CATACOMBS - STORAGE BUNKER\n</b>\nA metal door BUZZES open.  Tommy makes his way furtively inside, \npocketing the key card.\n\nA storage room filled with sawdust and wooden crates.  Tommy pries one of \nthem open.  Eyes widening in startled disbelief.\n\nA small arsenal of automatic rifles and ammunition inside.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\tHoly shit ...\n\nTommy lifts a rifle, awed by its devastating lines, then slams in a \ncartridge and bolts out the door.  Back into the tunnels.\n\n<b>INT. CEREMONIAL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\nA large, amber-hued chamber.  The CHANTING coven forms a circle around a \nprimitive stone altar where Kara is tied down, wearing a white gown, her \nhead adorned with a wreath of mistletoe.\n\nA wooden symbol of Thorn, like an inverted crucifix, hangs in a place of \nreverence.\n\nBehind the altar, the Shape stands in its cell.  Waiting.\n\nLoomis is led inside.  Wynn glides through this macabre gathering, up to \nthe altar.  Looming over the terrified Kara.\n\nThe CHANTING continues as Wynn dons a magnificent ceremonial robe.  At \nWynn's gesture, there is SILENCE.  The worshippers offer an obedient \nresponse, removing their hoods, baring the mark of Thorn on their wrists.\n\nWe recognize many of the faces in the congregation.  Wynn's staff.  Dr. \nBonham.  Mrs. Blankenship.  The cross-eyed attendant from the bus depot.  \nPeople from all walks of life.\n\nFaces glazed with sadistic rapture.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (prophetically)\n\tBehind, Disciples of Thorn!  The final sign!  The birth of \n\tthe heretic child, delivered unto us on the eve of our \n\tgreat Feast of the Sun ... as I have foreseen it.\n\nJamie's baby is carried forth, CRYING as it is lain inside a baptismal urn \nbeside Kara.  Ringed by candles and a circle of stones -- eleven in all -- \netched with symbolic runes.\n\n<b>INT. TUNNELS\n</b>\nLetting the rifle guide him, Tommy makes his way through the tunnels.  \nToward the sound of MUFFLED CHANTING up ahead.\n\n<b>CEREMONIAL ROOM\n</b>\nThe coven CHANTS its invocation.  Wynn draws a magic circle around the \ninfant with blood from a silver chalice.  Then he inscribes a pentagram in \nthe air with an ornate dagger.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tSpirits and powers of the flame, attend and witness this \n\tritual.  Bear our gifts to Thorn.  Open us to the path of \n\tDarkness.  By these runes transform us. Open our eyes and \n\tshow us the Chosen One to whom we offer this sacrifice of \n\tInnocent Blood.\n\nSuddenly Danny is issued forth up to the altar.  His eyes dark, lifeless \npools.  Kara struggles against her bonds.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tDanny!!!\n\nLoomis lurches forward.  Halted by massive, restraining hands.\n\n<b>CATWALK\n</b>\nTommy moves cautiously along the narrow wooden lip, looking down upon the \nevil ritual.  Startled by the SOUND of rusted chains.  Pulleys CRANKING.  \nThe Shape's cell being opened.\n\n<b>CEREMONIAL ROOM\n</b>\nThe Shape emerges from its cell and slowly walks forward.  Strangely calm.  \nHypnotized.  Looming above Kara.  She lets out a SCREAM of unbridled terror \nas he raises a gleaming dagger.\n\nWynn stands behind Danny.  Places the dagger in his hand and holds it aloft.\nAbove the baby.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tStrong and fierce Thorn, Thundered, by thy hammer we summon \n\tthee and offer this sacrifice of innocent blood.  Let thy \n\tDarkness descend on your son. Danny.  Lord of the Dead.\n\nDanny drifts into the dark spell, holding the dagger above the SCREAMING \ninfant.  Wynn speaks in the ominous WHISPERING VOICE:\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tKill for him, Danny ... Kill for him.\n\nKara cries, appealing to the boy inside of Michael.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tMichael, please.  You can make him stop.  You remember, \n\tdon't you?\n\nThe Shape stares hard at her through the sockets of its mask.  Listening.  \nReminded of his mother.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tRemember what he did to you that night. What his voice told \n\tyou to do.  You can stop it, Michael.  Stop the voice \n\tforever.\n\nDanny's eyes flash like fire.  The CHANTING is insidious.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tKill him, Danny.  Kill him!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tDanny, don't listen!  The voice isn't real!\n\nDanny turns sharply, seeing his mother.  Suddenly terrified.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tKill him, Danny!  You feel the rage inside!  You are Thorn!\n\nSuddenly Danny drops the dagger.  Wynn flies at him, SCREAMING like an \nenraged beast.  The Shape raises its dagger and plunges it -- into Wynn!\n\nWynn's eyes go wide with shock.  The Shape lurches empathetically.  Wynn \nstaggers, yanks the blade from his stomach.\n\nRAPID-FIRE GUNSHOTS rip through the chamber as Tommy lets loose a barrage \nof bullets from above.  Taking out several coven members, the rest scattering,\nretreating into the tunnels.\n\nLoomis dives Danny a split second before he through Kara's bonds with the \ndagger.\n\nKara springs toward the baby as the room is ripped apart by GUNFIRE.  The \naltar decimated.  Candles falling.  Setting the room ablaze.\n\nWynn releases the supports which suspend the catwalk.  Wooden girders CRASH \ndown from the ceiling.  Tommy pitches to the floor, dropping the rifle.\n\nThe Shape staggers, trying to get to its feet.  Slowly.  Painfully.  Flames \nlapping at its back.\n\nLoomis crawls toward the rifle.  Grabs it.  Rises just as Wynn seizes Danny, \na dagger at his throat.  Pulling him away.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tNo!!!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\tStay away, Sam.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tLeave the boy.  Take me.\n\nLoomis slowly places the rifle down in front of Wynn.  Surrendering himself.\n\nTommy drags himself toward Kara and the baby.  Paralyzed with horror as they try to \nanticipate Wynn's move.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tWYNN\n</b>\t   (smiles trenchantly)\n\tGood-bye, Dr. Loomis.\n\nLoomis turns.  Gasps in startled reflex.  The Shape rises up behind him, \nswiping the dagger across his chest!\n\nWynn retreats and flies through a doorway with Danny.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tDANNY\n</b>\tMommy!!!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tDanny!!!\n\nTommy and Kara race across the flame-engulfed room, reaching the door just \nas it SLAMS shut.  Cutting them off.\n\nThe Shape, the trail of flames growing on its back, hurls Loomis over the \ncrushed altar.\n\nTommy sees Loomis writhing on the floor, about to go for him when --\n\nThe Shape turns on them!  Tommy stands in front of Kara and the baby, \nbacking away, propelling them out into the tunnels.\n\nThe Shape walks forward in fevered pursuit, all but consumed by fire.\n\n<b>TUNNELS\n</b>\nTommy, Kara and Danny race deep into the heart of the tunnel maze.\n\n<b>LOOMIS\n</b>\npainfully crawls away.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tLOOMIS\n</b>\tDie, Michael.  In the name of God, die!\n\n<b>END OF TUNNEL\n</b>\nTommy, Kara and Danny reach the tunnel end.  Kara pounds frantically on the \nelevator panel.  A DEAFENING ROAR -- the SOUND of fire as the Shape sweeps \ntoward them.\n\n<b>THE SHAPE\n</b>\nglides steadily through the tunnels.  A walking pillar of flame.  Undaunted.  \nUnstoppable.  Hell-spawned.\n\n<b>END OF TUNNEL\n</b>\nFinally the doors open.  Kara and Tommy barrel inside.  Mashing buttons until \nthe doors close -- a millisecond before the Shape reaches them.\n\n<b>INT. ELEVATOR\n</b>\nKara cradles the baby.  Tommy waits anxiously as the old elevator MOANS and \nGRINDS toward ground level.  The doors open.\n\n<b>INT. SANITARIUM CORRIDOR\n</b>\nThey barrel off the elevator and race down a long corridor.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\tThis way!\n\nTommy leads her toward an exit sign.  Behind them, the elevator doors close. \nThe indicator light shows it moving down.\n\nThey reach a dead end.  The row of coded security cages.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tWhat now?!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\t   (realization)\n\tWait a minute ...\n\nHe reaches into his pocket -- withdrawing Wynn's key card!\n\nSuddenly the elevator doors open.  FIRE GUSTS.  The Shape emerges, totally \nengulfed in flame.  The emergency sprinklers are activated.  Dousing the \nflames as it walks after them.\n\nTommy panics, runs the key card.  The gate BUZZES open.  They run through.  \nThe Shape's hands lurch through the bars, missing Kara by inches.\n\nThey race toward the next gate.  The gate behind them opens, and the Shape \nwalks through!\n\nTommy runs the card again.  The gate BUZZES.  They slam it -- one step \nahead of the Shape.\n\nThe third and final gate.  Tommy tries the card.  Nothing!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tCome on!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\t   (tries it again)\n\tIt's not working!\n\nThe Shape moves through the last gate.  Inside the cage with them!\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tTOMMY\n</b>\t   (continuing)\n\tSomeone's controlling it!\n\n<b>INT. WYNN'S OFFICE (SAME)\n</b>\nStanding behind his computer, observing them on the security monitors, Dr. \nWynn jams the card's access code.  Then he grabs his satchel and strides \nquickly out of the office.  Pulling Danny with him.\n\nOn the screens, we can SEE the Shape approaching.  Kara's SCREAM can almost \nbe heard on the silent monitor.\n\n<b>INT. SECURITY CAGE (SAME)\n</b>\nKara SCREAMS as the Shape rakes Tommy against the cage.  Kara cowers in the \ncorner, protecting the baby.\n\n<b>EXT. SANITARIUM - FIELD - NIGHT (SAME)\n</b>\nWynn races with Danny across the field toward the waiting helicopter.  \nGetting ready for take-off as they duck inside.\n\n<b>INT. SECURITY CAGE\n</b>\nThe Shape slams Tommy's head against the bars; he slumps to the floor.  Then \nturns its murderous attention on Kara and the baby.\n\n<b>INT. WYNN'S OFFICE\n</b>\nA hand reaches into the top desk drawer, removes the .357 and FIRES an entire \nround into the security console.  Destroying it.\n\nThe man holding the gun is Loomis.\n\n<b>INT. SECURITY CAGE\n</b>\nThe door BUZZES open.  Kara drags Tommy and the baby out.  Slamming the door \nshut on the Shape.  Trapping it inside.\n\nThe Shape lurches against the bars in wild paroxysms.\n\n<b>EXT. SANITARIUM - LANDING FIELD\n</b>\nTommy comes to as he races with Kara and the baby across the windswept field.  \nSuddenly they stop dead, watching in horror as the helicopter lifts off.\n\nKara stands paralyzed with shock, looking skyward.  The helicopter disappears \ninto the gloom-filled night.\n\nTommy drags Kara in another direction.  A vehicle parked nearby.  The white \nvan.\n\n<b>INT. VAN (SAME)\n</b>\nKara lifts the baby inside.  Tommy flops down in the driver's seat.  Face \nbruised and bloody.  A key in the ignition.\n\nKara holds Jamie's baby.  Tears falling.\n<b>\t\t\n</b><b>\t\tKARA\n</b>\tHow will we ever find him?\n\nTommy's gaze terrifies her.  He starts the engine and tears off toward the \nsanitarium gate.\n\nKara looks down at the baby, then stares numbly forward.\n\nIn the back of the van, we can SEE the the Shape's white mask.  Glowing in \nthe darkness.  Emerging.\n\nKara and Tommy drive on, unaware.  And that, for now, is how we leave them.\n<b>\t\t\t\n</b><b>\t\t\t     FADE OUT.\n</b>\n<b>ROLL FINAL CREDITS\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b></b></pre>\n<b></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Daniel Farrands\" title=\"Scripts by Daniel Farrands\">Daniel Farrands</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers Script.html#comments\" title=\"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:06:49.184978"}
