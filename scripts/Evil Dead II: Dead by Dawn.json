He stands\n      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering\n      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his\n      bearings.\n\n\n<b>692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692\n</b>\n      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange\n      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.\n      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:\n\n<b>                              WARRIOR #1\n</b>               Hail he, who has come from the sky,\n               to deliver us from the terrors of\n               the deadites!\n\n<b>                              WARRIOR #4\n</b>               Hail!\n\n<b>                              WARRIOR #5\n</b>               Hail!\n\n      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors\n      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their\n      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.\n\n      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands\n      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.\n      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.\n\n      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a\n      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the \"Hero\n      from the Sky\" that we saw earlier in the film.  The\n      strange \"jagged edged longsword\" is Ash's chainsaw.\n\n      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle\n      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of\n      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the\n      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand\n      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the\n      title \"EVIL DEAD\" appears on the screen acompanied by\n      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts\n      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS <u>BOOM</u>.\n\n                             <u>THE</u> <u>END</u>\n\n\n   </pre>\n\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Sam Raimi\" title=\"Scripts by Sam Raimi\">Sam Raimi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Scott Spiegel\" title=\"Scripts by Scott Spiegel\">Scott Spiegel</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn Script.html#comments\" title=\"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:04:56.110356"}
