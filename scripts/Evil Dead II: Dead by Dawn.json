WORK SHED - NIGHT - LINDA DUMMY HEAD - ASH       187\n\n      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash\n      and Linda's head on the end of his hand.

WORK SHED - ASH                    187A\n\n      As he places Linda's head within the vice and\n      tightens it around her, then withdraws his hand.\n\n                              LINDA'S HEAD\n               Even now we have your darling Linda's\n               soul!

Wondering what has happened to the\n      chainsaw.  Behind him, the door to the shed bursts\n      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of\n      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high\n      above her head.  Ash is screaming.\n\n\n187D  MEDIUM SHOT                                           187D\n\n      Ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it\n      toward the approaching blade.\n\n\n187E  CLOSE SHOT                                            187E\n\n      The crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a\n      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping\n      backward.\n\n\n187F  MEDIUM SHOT - HEADLESS LINDA DUMMY - 3 ANGLES         187F\n\n      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs\n      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her\n      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way\n      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the\n      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the\n      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,\n      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.\n\n\n187G  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187G\n\n      As he is splattered with black bile.

A vision of beAuty.  She is\n      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from\n      her eyes.\n\n                              LINDA\n               Please Ash, help me.

And moves past\n      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking\n      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the\n      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound\n      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a\n      demon.\n\n\n187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R\n\n      As it is splattered with blood.\n\n\n187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S\n\n      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the\n      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen\n      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in\n      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his\n      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.\n\n      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying\n      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting\n      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of\n      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.\n\n\n188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188\n\n      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the\n      work shed and towards the cabin.  Again clutching\n      the chainsaw.\n\n\n189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189\n\n      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door\n      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.\n      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He\n      moves in the direction of the sound.\n\n\n189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A\n      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD\n\n      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of\n      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the\n      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows\n      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.\n\n\n189B  INT.

Ash gathers\n      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the\n      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.\n      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly\n      halts, on its own accord.\n\n\n190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190\n\n      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and\n      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with\n      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his\n      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.\n\n                              ASH\n               I'm fine... I'm fine...\n\n\n191   INT.

It\n      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his\n      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of\n      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.\n\n\n192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192\n      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR.

Ash has\n      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same\n      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at\n      them incredulously, then to the mirror.\n\n\n194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194\n\n      His reflection is as it should be.\n\n\n195   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      195\n\n      He looks back down to his hands.\n\n\n196   INT.

It's veins throb and\n      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's\n      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.\n      Ash is repulsed.\n\n\n198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198\n\n      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is\n      countered by his good hand.\n\n\n199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199\n\n      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.

Ash's view of the serene sky\n      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his\n      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS\n      stand directly over him.\n\n\n676P1 PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - THE RIFT                  676P1\n\n\n676P2 PLATE FOR PREVIOUS SCENE - MINIATURE                 676P2\n      SMOKE AND FLAME\n\n\n677   OMIT                                                  677\n\n\n678   CLOSE SHOT - ASH AND WARRIORS                         678\n\n      As he looks to the warriors above him.\n\n      The first warrior raises a bloodstained longsword\n      and poises it above Ash's head.\n\n                              WARRIOR #1\n               Slay the beast!\n\n                              WARRIOR #2\n               'Tis a deadite!\n\n      All raise their swords ready for the kill.\n\n\n679   MED.

SHOT - WARRIORS                                  691\n\n      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands\n      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering\n      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his\n      bearings.\n\n\n692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692\n\n      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange\n      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.\n      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:\n\n                              WARRIOR #1\n               Hail he, who has come from the sky,\n               to deliver us from the terrors of\n               the deadites!\n\n                              WARRIOR #4\n               Hail!\n\n                              WARRIOR #5\n               Hail!\n\n      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors\n      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their\n      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.\n\n      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands\n      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.\n      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.\n\n      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a\n      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the \"Hero\n      from the Sky\" that we saw earlier in the film.  The\n      strange \"jagged edged longsword\" is Ash's chainsaw.\n\n      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle\n      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of\n      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the\n      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand\n      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the\n      title \"EVIL DEAD\" appears on the screen acompanied by\n      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts\n      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.\n\n                             THE END\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Sam Raimi\u00a0\u00a0Scott Spiegel\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Action\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:24:52.887805"}
