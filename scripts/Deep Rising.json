The Sailors\n               work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The\n               JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic\n               position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation\n               of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate\n               DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and\n               dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS\n               as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth\n               gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.\n\n<b>         4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4\n</b>\n               The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes\n               widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below\n               sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS,\n<b>               HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.\n</b>\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>         5     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     5\n</b>\n               As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums\n               leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths,\n               away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops\n               into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty\n               thousand feet of water. \n\n               But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.\n\n               Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.\n\n               The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON.\n               The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an\n               enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone\n               pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below.\n\n<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>         6     DEEP SEA - NIGHT                                         6\n</b>\n               THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC\n               ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its \"hand\" is a\n               high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies,\n               then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock\n               into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. \n\n               Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the\n               cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and\n               sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side.\n\n<b>                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>         7     MINDINAO DEEP - NIGHT                                    7\n</b>\n               A desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing\n               lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL\n               SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK\n<b>               FISSURE.\n</b>\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>         8     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     8\n</b>\n               The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi\n               dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN\n               TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then,\n               dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked\n               by a rock-encrusted embankment. \n\n               The MUSIC builds. \n\n               The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide\n               up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized\n               by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And\n               the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. \n\n               As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is\n               filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here\n               and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of\n               several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark\n               cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. \n\n               The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just\n               stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>         9     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     9\n</b>\n               The vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is\n               nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting\n               equipment. \n\n               Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking.\n\n               Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi\n               dome. Giant skeletons everywhere.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        10     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                    10\n</b>\n               The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation. The\n               robotic arm comes out. The laser cutter steadies, aims, then\n               shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock.\n\n<b>               WHOOSH!! A HUGE JET STREAM OF INKY BLOOD BLASTS OUT OF THE\n</b><b>               FORMATION!\n</b>\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        11     SHNKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                     11\n</b>\n               The Captain and the Science Officers recoil as the inky stuff\n               envelopes the plexi-dome, completely blotting out the VIEW.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        12     PALAWAN TROUGH - NIGHT                                  12\n</b>\n               The Shinkai VANISHES into a huge cloud of inky blood. We HOLD\n               for a LONG OMINOUS BEAT. And then, like a slow-motion\n               earthquake, large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift\n               in the murky waters. WHALE BONES TOPPLE and SCATTER. Several\n               feet under the ancient silt, something is coming alive.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        13     SHINKAI 9000 - NIGHT                                    13\n</b>\n               Everything outside the plexi-dome is still BLACK. Everyone is\n               staring at the position board, which shows a large section of\n               the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, its contours incongruous\n               with the rest of the graphic representation. \n\n               The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks\n               commands. The Crew leaps into high gear. \n\n               Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal\n               he starts to back out. \n\n               The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and\n               impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes\n               ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS\n               BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese. \n\n               The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on\n               it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it\n               stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead\n               quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is\n               HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing\n               across the outside of the hull. Very creepy. \n\n               The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.\n               And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can.\n               The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.\n               WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING\n               DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.\n               And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES. A massive CHURNING SWIRL of\n               water, metal and men.\n\n<b>                                                       SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        14     SOUTH CHINA SEA - SUNSET                                14\n</b>\n               THE SAIPAN, a tricked out Jet Foil, built for speed not\n               looks, gunmetal blue, lean and mean, rips across the choppy\n               water.

She goes right to the vault, opens one of the\n               boxes, removes the giant diamond, drops it down her\n               decolletage, pulls her high heels off, and runs out.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        83     ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT                                     83\n</b>\n               Finnegan and Pantucci run to the end of a long section of\n               metal grating, right below a staircase, to catch their\n               breath. Everything has gone dead quiet, except for the\n               billowing and clanging of the engines.

Then, like a locomotive gathering\n               speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and\n               faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two\n               of them.\n\n<b>               LOUDERFASTERLOUDERFASTER!!!\n</b>\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         Come on!!\n\n               Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they\n               can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and\n               falls.

A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian.\n               Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. \n\n               Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed.\n               Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.\n               Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- \n\n               The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach.\n               Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place.\n               Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees\n               -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up\n               and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling\n               their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to\n               Finnegan. \n\n               Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's\n               feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen\n               in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.\n               Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall.\n               FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES\n               against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. \n\n               A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He\n               leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle,\n               turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to\n               run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap\n               onto his arm. HE YELLS. \n\n               The Creature starts reeling him in. \n\n               ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She\n               stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. \n\n               ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being\n               reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle.\n               When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running\n               back. Panting hard, she aims the gun.\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         Shoot it! Shoot it!\n\n               Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the\n               tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)\n</b>                         The safety! The safety!\n\n               Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right\n               lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to\n               find it.\n\n<b>                                   TRILLIAN\n</b>                         I don't know where it is!\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         On the side!!\n\n               Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best\n               thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS\n               the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink\n               blood, releases Finnegan and recoils.\n\n               Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The\n               tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again.\n               Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to\n               his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle\n               coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan\n               grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and\n               fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN (CONT'D)\n</b>                         Let's get the hell out of here!\n\n               Finnegan staggers to his feet.

Hanover\n               stands with a very antsy Mamooli, steaming. After a long\n               moment, he strides off after Finnegan as well.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        93     BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY                                93\n</b>\n               In SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened,\n               pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping\n               the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their\n               faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding\n               out of chests. \n\n               The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. \n\n               Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking\n               reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan\n               continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes\n               nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. \n\n               LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian\n               and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark\n               foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They\n               come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan\n               turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head.\n               He has none.\n\n<b>                                   HANOVER\n</b>                             (whispered)\n                         Very good Finnegan...very good.\n\n               Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and\n               pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat\n               mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times,\n               and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan\n               looks at her curiously, but with respect.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        94     BALLAST SECTION - DAY                                   94\n</b>\n               They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are\n               indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND.\n               Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some\n               STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single\n               violently twisted HATCH DOOR. \n\n               Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. \n\n               Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle\n               to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton,\n               who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well\n               at all.\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         What's on the far side?\n\n<b>                                   CANTON\n</b>                         I don't know.\n\n<b>                                   PANTUCCI\n</b>                             (nerves)\n                         It's your damn ship!

Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they\n               swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts.\n               The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift\n               up from the darkness below. \n\n               The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind.\n               He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM!\n               AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers\n               on the dead hand seem to reach out for him.

Hanover keeps a sharp,\n               nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse\n               rifle. Chin and Mamooli keep watch, tight lipped.

Down the gangway. \n\n               Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens\n               fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        97     KITCHEN - NIGHT                                         97\n</b>\n               Finnegan explodes to the surface.

Then\n               without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the\n               water, disappearing beneath the surface. \n\n               Trillian is astounded. She throws down her pistol, picks up\n               the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger. The recoil of the\n               rifle throws her into the water. When she surfaces, she sees\n               Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge.\n               Still holding her rifle, she dives.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>        99     UNDERWATER - NIGHT                                      99\n</b>\n               Trillian swims down a violently SHAKING PASSAGEWAY.

Mamooli leaps\n               through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift\n               motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped.\n               Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps.\n               He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns...

The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.\n\n               Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge\n               GELATINOUS WOMB.

Several\n               TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re\n               forms in some sort of strange mitosis. \n\n               Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified.\n               But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at\n               them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as\n               their hands ooze through the thick gelatin.

The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the\n               gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only\n               move in slow motion. The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh. She\n               tries to scream, but her face is already starting to\n               constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed.

And\n               there it is -- The huge, horrible, mutated, mucus-covered,\n               sucker-faced HEAD OF THE CREATURE. \n\n               A giant mutated protoplasm. Jutting up from a breach in the\n               floor. The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the\n               Tentacles come from, is below the next deck. A slimy,\n               translucent MEMBRANE slowly RISES, REVEALING what appears to\n               be some sort of ORGANIC LIQUID EYE. It seems to stare right\n               at Finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight. A Tentacle\n               slowly starts to move in on Finnegan. \n\n               Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris\n               that blocks his shot. The EYEBALL-type organism follows him.\n               Another Tentacle starts to move. Silently undulating through\n               the water towards Finnegan. The membrane over the EYE moves.\n               And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill. They\n               are surrounding Finnegan. Finnegan comes around the shattered\n               D.J. booth. Faces the Creature full-on. He can't miss. He\n               gives it a wicked smile.\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         Get a good look...\n\n               In SLOW-MOTION, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle. It DRIPS\n               WATER. He jams the gun-butt into his hip. Takes aim -- FIRES!\n               But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES\n               OUT and GRABS him. JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle\n               goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into\n               the floor, and the death that awaits him.\n               He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer,\n               closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return,\n               when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the\n               tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As\n               he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him.\n               Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying\n               sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it\n               strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the\n               vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several\n               Tentacles already after him.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       146     WATERSPORTS PLATFORM - NIGHT                           146\n</b>\n               Trillian sits up on the jet ski.

He rounds a corner. A\n               TENTACLE SIDE-SWIPES him. Hard. SMASHES him into a wall.\n               Finnegan DROPS the shotgun. Hits the floor running. Another\n               TENTACLES CHECKS him. Sends him SPIRALING through a hatch. \n\n               Finnegan TUMBLES in. Face-first. Quickly rolls over and looks\n               back -- A TENTACLE LASHES in through the doorway. Finnegan\n               back-pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various\n               sports equipment. The TENTACLE homes-in on him. CHARGES\n               FORWARD. Finnegan hurls himself backwards. THROWING anything\n               that comes to hand at the Tentacle. A VOLLEYBALL. A WATERSKI.\n               A TACKLE BOX. A FRISBEE. But onward it comes. Finnegan back\n               pedals faster. Over diving gear. Scuba tanks. Fins and masks. \n\n               The TENTACLE RISES. About to STRIKE. \n\n               Finnegan backs into the wall. Trapped. He spots a SPEARGUN.\n               Grabs it. \n\n               The TENTACLE LUNGES. Finnegan FIRES. NAILS IT. PINS IT to the\n               wall. Finnegan scrambles past the furiously WRITHING TENTACLE\n               and runs out of the room.\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>       148     WATERSPORT PLATFORM - NIGHT                            148\n</b>\n               Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into\n               the dark water.

But\n               the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and\n               shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle\n               comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it,\n               blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN\n               LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks\n               force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.\n\n<b>       151     FAST:                                                  151\n</b>\n               Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal\n               to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for\n               dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski.\n               Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS.\n               The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the\n               MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the\n               Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE\n               EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski.\n               Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways\n               across the water.\n\n<b>               BOUNCING HARD.\n</b>\n               Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the\n               water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass.\n               Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches\n               Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks\n               back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the\n               Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the\n               Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a\n               wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims\n               hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead\n               perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters\n               away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.\n\n<b>       152     FASTER:                                                152\n</b>\n               Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. Slides up next to\n               Trillian. Grabs her by her arm. Rips her out of the water.\n               Throws her onto the back of the jet ski. Just as a tentacles\n               rises up, lashing out. He GUNS IT. SMASHES through the waves.\n               The WARHEAD SPLASHES through the water. The jet ski hauls\n               ass.\n\n<b>               ENGINES WHINING OUT.\n</b>\n               Faster and faster. A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front\n               of the jet ski. A tentacle slaps down hard. Finnegan cuts\n               hard. Too late. The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser.\n               They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water. The\n<b>               SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD. \n</b>\n               Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty\n               meters away. Now fifteen.\n\n               Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find\n               Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles\n               converging on him from the murky depths. The \"retrieve\"\n               feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards\n               where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the\n               surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet\n               ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging\n               Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides. \n\n               The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed\n               whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The\n               WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away\n               from hitting the Fuji Maru.\n\n               Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.\n\n<b>       153     GO INTO SLO-MO NOW AS:                                 153\n</b>\n               Finnegan paddles hard. Sucking in as much water as he is air.\n               A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water. Looms above Finnegan\n               and Trillian. Dripping water. About to strike. There's\n               nowhere to hide. Finnegan paddles harder.\n\n<b>       154     COME OUT OF SLOW-MO AS:                                154\n</b>\n               The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE. And that's when the\n               SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru. The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull.\n\n<b>               BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!\n</b>\n               The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.\n\n<b>               METAL FLIES.\n</b>\n<b>               WATER SPRAYS.\n</b>\n               FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru\n               CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan\n               drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another\n               EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea.\n               Sends shock waves across the water. \n\n               Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island.\n               Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU\n               SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface.\n               A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and\n               STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the\n               water.\n\n<b>                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>       155     BEACH - SUNRISE                                        155\n</b>\n               Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the\n               beach of the island. \n\n               They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted.\n               Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to\n               sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and\n               pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun\n               refracts off it brilliantly... \n\n               Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture\n               perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she\n               heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time\n               since they know each other there is nobody around. No people.\n               No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something\n               else comes to mind besides survival. \n\n               Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards\n               Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer... \n\n               And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE\n               WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.\n\n               But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell-\n               shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help\n               him to his feet.\n\n<b>                                   PANTUCCI\n</b>                         Was it the water in my eyes or were\n                         you guys about to...\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         Joey...\n\n<b>                                   PANTUCCI\n</b>                         Because it's cool, you know, I can\n                         always take a walk or something\n                         down the beach...\n\n<b>                                   FINNEGAN\n</b>                         Joey...\n\n<b>                                   PANTUCCI\n</b>                         Or I could go for a\n                         swim...although, I gotta tell\n                         you...if I never get in the water\n                         again...\n\n<b>                                   BOTH\n</b>                         Joey!!\n\n<b>                                   PANTUCCI\n</b>                         OK...OK...you don't have to beg me\n                         ...I'll stick around...\n\n               And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,\n               teeth- shattering ROAR ever.
