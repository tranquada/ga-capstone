Your gonna be\n             alright.\n\nKristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the\ndashboard.

The car hits the surface...\n\nINT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY\n\nTrevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He\nbreaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings\nhe see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is\nseparating him from his wife.\n\nTreading water, he looks out at the car and there she is\ntrapped inside...\n\nKirsty\n\nStill belted to her seat.

Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this\nway and that.\n\n                    TREVOR\n          Do you kids mind keeping it down?\n\nThe creepy old woman speaks up.\n\n                    OLD WOMAN\n          Aww let them be. They're only kids.\n\nTrevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's\nbootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor\nstares at the bootie tears welling up.\n\nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nTrevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty-\nlevel. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see\nremnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes\nsit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette.\n\nTrevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame.\nWe're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding,\nlimbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles\nfrom the TV.\n\n                    DEMONIC VOICE FROM TV\n          YOU LOSE...\n\nThe screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and\nsits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV.\nA picture of Kirsty.\n\n                                                             11.\n\n\n\nINT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nTrevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and\nKirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty.\nSmiles, smiles, smiles...\n\nHe stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've\npointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is\ndark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object\nKirsty is holding.\n\nEXT.

A jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to\nstop.

BREAK ROOM - DAY\n\nInside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, Trevor\neyes a vending machine, examining its wares. He peruses the\nsundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix.\n\nIt's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in\npain. He shuts his eyes. A couple of the fluorescent bulbs\nover his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly.\n\nWhen Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has\ngotten considerably darker.

He goes right up to the glass and\npeers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. This\nstrain on his eyes intensifies his headache.\n\nIt's still pretty murky inside the glass case. Trevor squints\nand just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is\nit? A candy bar?-\n\nA PALE HAND suddenly presses against the glass from inside\nthe machine. Trevor jolts backwards. The hand is gone. But in\nthe reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been\nstanding behind him. He whirls around-\n\n-and is face to face with our worst nightmare: PINHEAD.\n\n                       PINHEAD\n             It's too late.\n\nPinhead lashes out at Trevor striking his face with a clawed\nhand the rips his face clean off. The lights are back up as\nTrevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. It's\nstill there!\n\nWhere Pinhead was standing is THE WOMAN who just slapped him.\n\n                       WOMAN\n             SNAP OUT OF IT!\n\nShe is attractive and studious.

Trevor climbs out and starts\nwalking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away,\nthe only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps.\n\nPOV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight\ndistance. Someone is following him.\n\nSensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty\nsidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his\napartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody\nthere... then suddenly-\n\n-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite\nside of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the\npace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace\nas well.\n\nTrevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he\ntake this home?\n\nA enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and\nlunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us)\nabout piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor\nregains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves\ntoward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops\nbarking and actually cowers back into the shadows.\n\nSpooked, Trevor rushes up to:\n\nEXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nHe hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.\n\nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT\n\nHe looks out on the street.\n\nThe figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's\nfeatures are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring\nat Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers\nout at the street from inside the front hall.\n\nThe figure is gone.\n\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             21.\nCONTINUED:\n\n\nTrevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it\nlights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items\nsitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a\ncold beer, when a light out his window urges him to\ninvestigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS.\n\nPOV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window\nin the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY\nMAN that followed Trevor home.\n\nThe man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's\nholding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the\nwindow winks out, rendering it dark again.\n\nTrevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the\ndarkness still gazing at him.\n\nTrevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't\nbreathe.\n\nTHE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG...\nBONG... BONG...\n\nTrevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits\nout a massive amount of water!\n\nBONG... BONG... BONG...\n\nTrevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving\nup mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning...\n\nBONG... BONG... BONG...\n\nIn the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves,\npebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head\npokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers\nacross the floor, up the window sill and out into the night.\n\n-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous\nlungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely\ndry. Stunned, he looks about him.\n\nTrevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His\nvideogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa.\n\nThe BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him.\n\nTrevor gets the door to find a striking young GOTHIC WOMAN on\nthe other side. Black hair, lipstick, fingernails. She smiles\n(too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then\nsummarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for\nTrevor.\n\n\n                                                  (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                             22.\nCONTINUED: (2)\n\n\n                    GOTHIC WOMAN\n          Here it is, what do you think?\n\nTrevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which\ncontains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans.\nAt its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl,\nwhich Gothic Woman then plays with. Trevor looks a little\nconfused.\n\n                    GOTHIC WOMAN (CONT'D)\n          I saw it on the counter, looked at the\n          name and the rest is history.

BUS - DAY\n\nTrevor sits at the front of the bus agitated.

The\nirritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his\nhead is still there.\n\nThe BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He\nlooks around.\n\nToward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a\nbaby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and\ndripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red\nwool down to their source:\n\nA DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been\nripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old\nlady's yarn.\n\nTrevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues\nHUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor\npulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off.

The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling\nfrom the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off.\n\nIN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops\nup. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin\ninto its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same\ntime Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head.\nHe squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone.\n\nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nLange is at his desk eating a sandwich.

I'm not\n          even Catholic. I just had to tell\n          somebody. It's like, ever since my wife\n          died I don't know what I've actually done\n          or what I've imagined. But I do know if\n          one tenth of what's happening to me is\n          reality... I've done some really awful\n          things in my life. Things that I've... I\n          guess I've blocked out...\n\n                    PRIEST\n          What things do you think you've done?\n\n                    TREVOR\n          Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little\n          time. For starters I was responsible for\n          the death my wife who by the way was\n          carrying my unborn child. That was so I\n          could collect her eight million dollar\n          estate. I think I killed several women I\n          was having mindless sex with behind her\n          back.\n                    (MORE)\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                                75.\nCONTINUED:\n                       TREVOR (cont'd)\n             But I did those murders just for the hell\n             of it. Finally... I think I made some\n             kind of deal with the devil and now he's\n             come to collect my soul. Only he's\n             decided to mess with my head first. How\n             many Hail Marys do you recommend for that\n             one father?\n\n                       PRIEST\n             Trevor I'm sure you killed no one. You\n             are very distraught over your wife's\n             death and rightfully so. You did the\n             right thing by confessing to me here\n             tonight. And you should keep praying for\n             the wisdom that will set your soul at\n             ease. That being said, you are still in a\n             highly emotional state right now. It\n             might do you some good to get some\n             professional help. Confess to them the\n             way you confessed to me. In time you'll\n             probably find that the real killer has\n             already been caught. Or better yet...\n             that these murders never happened at all.\n\n                       TREVOR\n             But I saw these women. I saw their\n             mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I\n             just know it happened I can feel it...\n\n                       PRIEST\n             All you've got is the here and the now\n             Trevor. That's all anyone really has.\n             Maybe this will make things easier to\n             understand. A man goes to sleep every\n             night and has recurring dream that he's a\n             butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if\n             he might actually be a butterfly who\n             dreams he's a man. And at the end of the\n             day does it even matter? All these events\n             you're describing. How can you be sure\n             any of them really happened?\n\n                       TREVOR\n             But that's what I need. To be sure... to\n             be absolutely sure...\n\n                       PRIEST\n             Shh. It's okay son. There is but one\n             truth.

He\njumps.\n\nTrevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He\nclimbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races\ndown the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same\ntime.\n\nHearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see:\n\nThe Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor,\nkeeping Trevor's pace.
