Strange skittering sounds, like\n                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...\n                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an\n                   eerie, alien cacophony.\n\n               2   EARTH                                                        2\n\n                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness.

BORG RECON CENTER                                       3\n\n                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is\n                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.\n                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the\n                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --\n                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.\n                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with\n                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can\n                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.\n                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,\n                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.\n\n                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad\n                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The\n                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to\n                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel\n                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of\n                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range\n                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The\n                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever\n                   is watching this is studying the human race.\n\n                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors\n                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will\n                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of\n                   voices speaking at once :\n\n                                           BORG\n                             Restrict search parameters to 1-9-\n                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.\n\n                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images\n                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.\n\n                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video\n                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-\n                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of\n                   enticing details. As the images race across the\n                   monitors, we should learn the following.\n\n                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.\n                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.\n                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.\n\n                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,\n                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The\n                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority\n                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second\n                   Dark Age.\n\n                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A\n                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created\n                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp\n                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.\n\n                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP\n                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed\n                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the\n                   human race.\n\n                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an\n                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never\n                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning\n                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.\n                   We see an early replicator producing food for the\n                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.\n\n                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form\n                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of \n                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for\n                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.\n\n                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star\n                   Trek universe.\n\n                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES\n                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a\n                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's\n                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic\n                   inflection, speaks for the first time:\n\n                                           WOMAN'S VOICE\n                             Stop search.

The BLAST smashes into the\n                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The\n                   Sphere returns FIRE.

The Borg fire\n                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.\n\n               6   NEW ANGLE                                                    6\n\n                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the\n                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this\n                   is just one small part of --\n\n               7   A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE                                       7\n\n                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged\n                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships\n                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. \n                   It's a spectacular sight.\n\n                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading\n                   off in another direction.\n \n               8   NEW ANGLE                                                    8\n\n                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking\n                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking\n                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it\n                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.\n\n                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in\n                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,\n                   causing massive damage.\n\n               9   THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E                                9\n\n                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered\n                   starship.\n\n                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful\n                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the\n                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more\n                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons\n                   and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this\n                   Enterprise is ready for anything.\n\n              10   INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE                                  10\n\n                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's\n                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and\n                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard\n                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the\n                   Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at\n                   the helm. WORF at Tactical.

This should\n                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the\n                   traditional \"bubble\" shielding, the new armor of this\n                   Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy\n                   across the hull.

In the middle is the WARP\n                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM\n                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and\n                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage.

About two feet in front of\n                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a\n                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,\n                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...\n\n                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as\n                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside\n                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment\n                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.\n\n              66   DATA'S POV                                                  66\n\n                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And\n                   we realize we're in --\n              \n              67   INT. BORG HIVE                                              67\n\n                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now\n                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.\n                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical\n                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.\n\n                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet\n                   technology and materials into the living, bio-\n                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone\n                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate\n                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of\n                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console\n                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower\n                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.\n\n                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with\n                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg\n                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and\n                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...\n                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying\n                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,\n                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.\n                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity\n                   left.\n\n              68   DATA                                                        68\n\n                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and\n                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the\n                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are\n                   clustered together in one section of the room, each\n                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits\n                   connected to its face.\n\n                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and\n                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre\n                   \"feeding\" or \"renewal\" is going on. The tubes all seem\n                   to lead toward the ceiling.\n\n                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS\n                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side\n                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of\n                   optical cabling to it.\n\n                                           DATA\n                                      (to Borg)\n                             Your efforts to assimilate me will\n                             be unsuccessful.\n\n                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the\n                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.\n                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.\n\n                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...\n                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the\n                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the\n                   cable go out.

And\n                   for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike\n                   any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale-\n                   skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back...\n                   a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish\n                   technology.

One of the Borg\n                   has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a\n                   series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES.

MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                      71\n\n                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --\n                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for\n                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of\n                   the original ranching community in some of the\n                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st\n                   century.\n\n                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits\n                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which\n                   provide the only source of power for the town. The\n                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them\n                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,\n                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled\n                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only\n                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.\n\n                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods\n                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the\n                   sight of the city and then head toward it...\n\n              72   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                                72\n\n                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying\n                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the\n                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of\n                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:\n\n                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's\n                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,\n                   technology -- all have changed over the course of\n                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used\n                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted\n                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-\n                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements\n                   now useless.\n\n                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --\n                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we\n                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The\n                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later\n                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the\n                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.\n\n                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other\n                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has\n                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are\n                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and\n                   tongs.\n\n                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate\n                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,\n                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of\n                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --\n                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental\n                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion\n                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic\n                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as\n                   people line up to get their daily rations.\n\n                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with\n                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community\n                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man\n                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic\n                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He\n                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks\n                   off.\n\n                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look\n                   about them. They're going through something that makes\n                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.\n                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a\n                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of\n                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and\n                   it's on the verge of collapse.\n\n                                                                          CUT TO:\n\n              73   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        73\n\n                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an\n                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the\n                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The\n                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,\n                   tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the\n                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard\n                   times.

People passing him,\n                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking\n                   ahead.

Ruby, the mysterious\n                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera\n                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a\n                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover\n                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made\n                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of\n                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is\n                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is\n                   she could be taking a picture of.

Before the war, Scrimm was probably\n                   one of the \"survivalists\" who used to be dismissed as\n                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came\n                   true.

Worf gives hand signals -- holds up\n                   two fingers, then a fist, and points forward.\n\n                   Two Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet,\n                   stop, and take up firing positions... then two more\n                   members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them\n                   and take positions further down the corridor. Classic\n                   military deployment.

Our tricorders are\n                             useless.\n\n                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,\n                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They\n                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,\n                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold\n                   darkness.\n\n              90   ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD                                     90\n\n                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,\n                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative\n                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry\n                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of\n                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing\n                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off\n                   an eerie glow.\n\n                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been\n                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly\n                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --\n                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,\n                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has\n                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,\n                   examines the corridor closely.\n\n                                           ENSIGN HAWK\n                             What the hell is going on?\n\n                                           WORF\n                             Borg...\n\n                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin\n                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's\n                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully\n                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and\n                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some\n                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team\n                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the\n                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.\n\n                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue\n                   their search. They continue making their way down the\n                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...\n\n              92   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                92\n\n                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE\n                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the\n                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The\n                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a\n                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this\n                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen\n                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird\n                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at\n                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly\n                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in\n                   there.\n\n                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up\n                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on\n                   Environmental Control.\n\n                                           WORF\n                             Worf to Bridge.

He's shining his phaser-beacon into\n                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over\n                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant\n                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where\n                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,\n                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of\n                   darkness.\n\n                                           WORF\n                                     (continuing)\n                              Negative.

The Ensign freezes,\n                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his\n                   imagination?\n\n                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing\n                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can\n                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping\n                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the\n                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that\n                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT\n                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of\n                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast\n                   we have trouble following it.\n\n                   Worf turns his head at the sound.\n\n                                           WORF\n                             Stand by, Commander\n                                     (to team)\n                             Where's Ensign Hawk?\n\n                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.\n                   Everyone is alert, keyed up.

We're falling back.\n\n                   Worf gives hand signals for the team to move out.

It's a delicate, fragile piece of\n                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.\n\n                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little\n                   puzzlement.\n\n                                           BORG QUEEN\n                                     (re: flesh)\n                             Do you know what this is, Data?\n\n                                           DATA\n                             It would appear that you are\n                             attempting to graft organic skin\n                             onto my endo-skeletal structure.\n\n                                           BORG QUEEN\n                             What a cold description... for\n                             such a beautiful gift.\n\n                   She smiles slightly, utterly confident.

The Borg Queen's LIPS move into\n                   frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath.

RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  119\n\n                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the\n                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No\n                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other\n                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very\n                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over\n                   from the inside.\n\n                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are\n                   sitting off the front porch.\n\n                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,\n                   feeble light.\n\n                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size\n                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the \n                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's\n                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,\n                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several\n                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the\n                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a \n                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath\n                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,\n                   trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An\n                   exhausting day.\n\n             120   PICARD                                                     120\n\n                   is watching her intently from afar. He's concealed\n                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many\n                   WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view.\n\n             121   RUBY                                                       121\n\n                   pulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over\n                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,\n                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off\n                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...\n                   undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off\n                   her hips...\n\n             122   PICARD                                                     122\n\n                   is surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This\n                   really isn't why he came out here.\n\n             123   RUBY                                                       123\n\n                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and\n                   panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt...\n                   pulls it off...\n\n             124   PICARD                                                     124\n\n                   doesn't want to look, but can't help himself...\n\n             125   RUBY                                                       125\n\n                   moves to the side of the porch... and steps into a\n                   large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves\n                   and helmet attached.\n\n             126   PICARD                                                     126\n\n                   is a little relieved... keeps watching...\n\n             127   RUBY                                                       127\n\n                   has now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit...\n                   pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to\n                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD\n                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal\n                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a\n                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks\n                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the\n                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...\n                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then\n                   turns the spigot...\n\n                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come\n                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the\n                   helmet.\n\n             128   PICARD                                                     128\n\n                   watches, curious about what she's doing...\n\n             129   RUBY                                                       129\n\n                   is now out of the bio-suit again... pulling on her\n                   shirt and jeans... grabs her jacket... turns off the\n                   lights in the house, and shuts the front door behind\n                   her. She begins walking toward the windmill.\n\n             130   PICARD                                                     130\n\n                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the\n                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill\n                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's\n                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches\n                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...\n\n             131   FRONT PORCH                                                131\n\n                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he\n                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small\n                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.\n\n             132   INT. RUBY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                             132\n\n                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's\n                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally\n                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.\n\n                   The house has only one room, which functions as a\n                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also\n                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,\n                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-\n                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of\n                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed\n                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are\n                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-\n                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of\n                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced\n                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --\n                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of\n                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,\n                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace\n                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a\n                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.\n\n                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to\n                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile\n                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at\n                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about\n                   her...\n\n                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the\n                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope\n                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There\n                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --\n                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.\n\n                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.\n                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the\n                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece\n                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a\n                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to\n                   bloom.\n\n                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then\n                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a\n                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see\n                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a\n                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way\n                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...\n\n                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that\n                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...\n\n             133   HIMSELF                                                    133\n\n                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air\n                   behind him.\n\n                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the\n                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a\n                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks\n                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of\n                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by\n                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.\n\n                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.\n                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's\n                   there...\n\n             134   RUBBY                                                      134\n\n                   is standing in the open doorway, a shotgun leveled at\n                   Picard.\n\n                                           RUBY\n                             You should pay closer attention to\n                             those little red lights.\n\n                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing\n                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.\n\n                                           RUBY\n                             You know, I'd be perfectly\n                             justified in shooting you right\n                             now.\n\n                   Picard glances at the photograph of himself.\n\n                                           PICARD\n                             I'd say you already have.\n\n                                           RUBY\n                             Don't flatter yourself.
