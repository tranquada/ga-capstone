They call it Starfleet.\n\n                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star\n                   Trek universe.\n\n                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES\n                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a\n                   shower of sparks.

People are\n                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and\n                   tongs.\n\n                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate\n                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,\n                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of\n                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --\n                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental\n                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion\n                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic\n                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as\n                   people line up to get their daily rations.\n\n                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with\n                   curious or suspicious looks.

They're going through something that makes\n                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.\n                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a\n                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of\n                   overwhelming odds.

Unlike the rest of\n                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing\n                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off\n                   an eerie glow.\n\n                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been\n                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly\n                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --\n                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,\n                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has\n                   gone on in this area of the ship.

It's\n                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully\n                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and\n                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some\n                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team\n                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the\n                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.\n\n                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue\n                   their search. They continue making their way down the\n                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...\n\n<b>              92   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                92\n</b>\n                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE\n                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the\n                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The\n                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a\n                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this\n                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen\n                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird\n                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at\n                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly\n                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in\n                   there.\n\n                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up\n                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on\n                   Environmental Control.\n\n<b>                                           WORF\n</b>                             Worf to Bridge.

He's shining his phaser-beacon into\n                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over\n                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant\n                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where\n                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,\n                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of\n                   darkness.\n\n<b>                                           WORF\n</b>                                     (continuing)\n                              Negative.

The Ensign freezes,\n                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his\n                   imagination?\n\n                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing\n                   happens.

Just as he begins to sense that\n                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT\n                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of\n                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast\n                   we have trouble following it.\n\n                   Worf turns his head at the sound.\n\n<b>                                           WORF\n</b>                             Stand by, Commander\n                                     (to team)\n                             Where's Ensign Hawk?\n\n                   Everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there.\n                   Everyone is alert, keyed up.

Every once\n                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up\n                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.\n                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're\n                   definitely creepy.\n\n                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,\n                   he's still immobilized.\n\n                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward\n                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling.

No\n                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other\n                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very\n                   solitary place.

The light from the house now lights the \n                   equipment a little, giving us a better view.

The windows have been painted black,\n                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-\n                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of\n                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed\n                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are\n                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-\n                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of\n                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced\n                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --\n                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of\n                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,\n                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace\n                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a\n                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.\n\n                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to\n                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile\n                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at\n                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about\n                   her...\n\n                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the\n                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope\n                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There\n                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --\n                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.\n\n                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.\n                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the\n                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece\n                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a\n                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to\n                   bloom.\n\n                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then\n                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a\n                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see\n                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper.
