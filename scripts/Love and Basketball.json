Walking in the kicks\n\tis a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap\n\tpulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELVIN (cont'd)\n\t\tThought only girls were moving in.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tThat's what my Moms said.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELVIN\n\t\tI hope he can ball.\n\n\t\t\t\tJAMAL\n\t\tBet he's a scrub.\n\n\tThe Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.\n\n\t\t\t\tKID\n\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tHey.\n\n\t\t\t\tKID\n\t\tCan I play?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tYou nice?\n\n\t\t\t\tKID\n\t\tYeah, I'm nice.\n\n\tQuincy looks the Kid up and down, then --\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tYou and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.\n\n\tQuincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the\n\tbaseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown\n\tface and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years\n\told.\n\n\t\t\t\tJAMAL\n\t\tAh man, he is a girl.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tGirls can't play no ball.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tBall better than you.\n\n\tQuincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the\n\tdriveway.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tWhat a dog.\n\n\tMonica shoots him a glare.\n\n\t\t\t\tJAMAL\n\t\tShe heard you.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tNuh uh, they could only hear dog\n\t\twhistles.\n\n\tMonica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks\n\tbackwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN\n\tAIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.\n\n\tQuincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY (cont'd)\n\t\tOne, zip.\n\n\tHe rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,\n\tJamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal\n\tand Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the\n\tbasket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.\n\n\tMonica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off\n\tthe backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at\n\ther in shock.

He\n\tthrows the ball back to Monica.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY (cont'd)\n\t\tTwo, one.\n\n\tMonica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica\n\tbounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tTwo, up.\n\n\tQuincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tKELVIN\n\t\tAaah, she dogged you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJAMAL\n\t\tShut up.\n\n\tThe game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets\n\tfor their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is\n\tunable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.\n\n\tQuincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tPoint.\n\n\tQuincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.\n\tThe ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.\n\n\tQuincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the\n\tball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY (cont'd)\n\t\tI got her.\n\n\tQuincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tTold you I was nice.

You're gonna be my\n\t\tcheerleader.\n\n\tMonica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.\n\tQuincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.\n\n\tQuincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.\n\tIn desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving\n\ther off balance.\n\n\tTHE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,\n\tFACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER\n\tFINGERS.\n\n\tThe boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes\n\twide with fear...and regret.\n\n\tINT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING\n\n\tMonica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes\n\tthe blood from her face with a washcloth.\n\n\t\t\t\tGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tEeew.\n\n\tHer sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.\n\tShe is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and\n\tpainted nails.\n\n\tHer father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.\n\n\t\t\t\tNATHAN\n\t\tHow are you feeling, munchkin?\n\n\tMonica nods.

Monica pulls the\n\twashcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood\n\therself.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMILLE\n\t\tI'll get some ice.\n\n\tShe exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.\n\n\tMonica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the\n\tmirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.\n\tSeeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left\n\tfor this little girl to do.  She smiles.\n\n\tINT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tQuincy sits at the kitchen table, writing \"I AM SORRY\" in\n\tblock letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with\n\tconcentration as he tries to write in a straight line.\n\n\tAt the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store\n\tbox to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She\n\tsmooths the frosting with a spoon.\n\n\tZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,\n\tenters.  He laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tGirl, who you trying to fool?\n\n\tQuincy looks up, smiles.

Had me\n\t\tthinking I was getting a sister who could\n\t\tburn.\n\n\tNona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly\n\tthrows down his pencil in frustration.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tI can't do this shit.\n\n\tZeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tBoy, what'd I tell you about using that\n\t\tword?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\t\t(sighs, then)\n\t\t\"Can't\" should never be in a man's\n\t\tvocabulary.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tWhy not?\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tCause when you say can't, you ain't a\n\t\tman.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tThat's right.\n\n\t\t\t\tNONA\n\t\tZeke.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tWhat?\n\t\t\t(then)\n\t\tOh, and, uh, don't say \"shit.\"\n\n\tNona just shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tNONA\n\t\tWe should head over.\n\n\t\t\t\tZEKE\n\t\tJust you and Quincy, baby.

WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n\n\n\tCamille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and\n\tQuincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at\n\teach other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.

Monica does the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY (cont'd)\n\t\tOkay, how bout this?\n\n\tQuincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It\n\tlooks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.\n\tThe cake falls onto his head and shoulder.\n\n\tMonica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.\n\tCamille and Nona rush back into the living room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMILLE\n\t\tMonica, what did you do?\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tNothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMILLE\n\t\t\t(to Nona)\n\t\tOh, all that work.\n\n\t\t\t\tNONA\n\t\tIt's...it's okay.

So the question is, how\n\t\twill you respond?  Well, your answer\n\t\tbetter be hard work and sacrifice because\n\t\tthat's the only way you're gonna make it\n\t\tthrough.

Something is\n\ton Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY\n\t\tYou know, the numbers I'm putting up are\n\t\tbetter than any freshman.

Zeke watches his son,\n\tthe rising star.\n\n\tEXT. MCCALL HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n\tThrough the windows, we see Quincy enter the house.  He\n\tglances around, then walks to the living room.  He sees his\n\tmom sitting outside by the pool, drink in hand, looking torn\n\tup.  He pulls open the sliding glass door.  Nona jumps, then\n\tsees Quincy.

He wouldn't lie.\n\n\tNona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.\n\n\tConfused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:\n\n\tZeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a\n\tyoung woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER,\n\tthey climb into his car.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINCY (cont'd)\n\t\tWhat...what's this?\n\n\t\t\t\tNONA\n\t\tI hired somebody.

Then she turns and\n\tcrosses away.\n\n\tINT. MONICA/SHAYLA'S DORM - NIGHT\n\n\tThe lights are off but Monica sits up in bed.
