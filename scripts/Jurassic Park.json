Their shapes ABSTRACT\nas THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.\n\nMOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual\nshapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,\nhairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the\ndifferent surfaces of the stones.\n\nCAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,\nabstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly\nRACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is\nfolded on its back.\n\nSLOW MOTION\n as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber\ntoward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The\ndrill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.\n\nA SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and\nextricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit\nglass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.\narriving under a long-lensed microscope.\n\nIN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately\nremoves a fragment of tissue.\n\nPINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube\nSPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.\n\nTHE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a\nneutral mist.\n\n                                                     WASH OUT TO:\n\nHOT SUN overhead in a BIG SKY -\n\n\nEXT  BADLANDS - AFTERNOON\n\nLodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains\nof A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI\nNG\nPANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers\nshoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,\nscribbling notes, and conferring with each other.\n\nThe center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that\ncircumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head\npaleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.\n\nGrant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.\nA GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.\n\nCLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.\n\nGrant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker\nway to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his\nfeet and addresses his students, who listen raptly.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Right calcaneus of an adult female\n          raptor.  Mild stress fractures.  What's\n          this tell me?\n\nStudents look at each other.  A tentative hand.  Grant continues.\n\n               \n             GRANT\n          It tells me that this bone connects to\n          the navicula which we already found\n          articulating to the cuboid.\n\nOFFSCREEN, a woman SHOUTS to him.\n\n                            ELLIE (off)\n          Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!\n\nGrant looks up.\n\nDR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs\nlike a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of\ndust behind her.\n\nShe zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her.\n\n                            STUDENT\n          Dr. Sattler!  Dr. Grant is thinking!\n\nDr. Grant waves her over enthusiastically with his bone and continues.\n\n                            GRANT\n          So, what can we stay for sure?  Stress\n          fractures in the heel ...\n\nUncertain students.  Ellie arrives and immediately gets into it.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          She jumps.\n\nGrant turns around to her and smiles.  She's got it.  Other students to\n- they knew is all along.\n\n            \n                GRANT\n          Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she\n          jump?\n\nNo answer.  Ellie gives it a try.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          A defensive posture against a vicious,\n          blood-thirsty T-Rex?\n\n                            GRANT\n              (nodding)\n          Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,\n          more tender leaves in the higher branches\n          with which to suckle her young?\n\nEllie jumps up.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          I bet is was a mating ritual.\n\nStudents laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.\n\n                            GRANT\n          The science of paleontology can't answer\n          these questions.  Novelists and artists\n          who dream a vision of the Jurassic period\n          can attempt these questions with their\n          imaginations.  What we scientists can say\n          is considering the mass and kinetic\n          articulation of these bones, this animal\n          had a vertical leap\n of about twelve feet.\n          Not as entertaining as fiction, but\n          absolutely fact without prejudice.\n\nEllie intrudes again.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Excuse me, Dr. Grant.  But ... fact is,\n          we're late.  There's the car.\n\nShe points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a\ndusty wake.\n\nGrant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually\nas Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Jim, you keep making up the plaster\n          batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,\n          it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after\n          five - when the temperature drops, those\n          bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I\n          don't want any tourists walking over my\n          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of\n          Montana is with them, just you guys.\n\nGrant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          You know, if ev\nery scientist stuck to his\n          method like you, there would be no body\n          of theory - no quasars, no big bang -\n\nGrant stops at the sight of the stopped limo and freezes.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Jesus, a limousine.  We're re-entering\n          Hammond's world, that's for sure.  (beat)\n          Remind me why we're doing this, Ellie.\n\nEllie is gentle.  She's telling him something they've discussed before.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          We're leaving the raptor dig -\n\n                            GRANT\n          - at a critical time -\n\n                            ELLIE\n          - because Gennaro is paying us sixty\n          thousand dollars to observe some resort\n          of Hammond's in Costa Rica. And that's -\n\n                            GRANT\n          - enough money to keep us free of\n          commercial affiliations for two summers.\n          All right, all right.  Good.\n\nThen, half-kidding with Ellie:\n\n                            GRANT\n          Financial\n independence for fraternizing\n          with the enemy?  (beat)  I'll do it.\n\nShe laughs.  But he can't quite leave.  He grabs a computer printout\n\n                            GRANT\n          This is all could come up with, Skip?\n\nSkip turns the printout right-side up in Grant's hand.  Grant smiles.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Wise guy.  Let's go, Ellie.\n\nGrant and Ellie board the limo amidst many goodbyes from the students.\nThe limo pulls away.\n\n\nEXT  HIGH TECH BUILDING - BIOGENETIC CORPORATION HQ - SUNSET\n\nA purple sunset irradiates the exterior glass walls of the building.\n\n\nINT  BIOGEN HQ\n\nA peanut flies in the air.  Then falls into a big open mouth.  THOMP.\n\n                            MOUTH\n          Five hundred thousand is peanuts!\n\nHe tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS\nNEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair\nand a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of\nplace on the rich leather sofa where he reclin\nes.\n\nAcross a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A\nsmooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy\nappearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.\n\nNedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          I'm not reneging.  I'm re-evaluating.\n\nNedry holds the can of coke upside-down, drains the last drops.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          You think I'm a scumbag, I know.\n\nNedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the\nother, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It\nskids across the glossy floor.\n\nBaker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic\n          industrial espionage, and you're bound to\n          run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!\n          Part of the job description.  Look, who's\n          to say, who is the real scumbag?  After\n          all, I know what you guys need so bad.\n          I've heard of reverse engineering.\n\nAs Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Let the other guy put in all the work,\n          all the R and D.  You take the finished\n          product, work backwards, breaking it down\n          to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In\n          a few measly months you have know-how\n          that took researchers ten years to\n          determine.  You know how much Hammond has\n          invested of his own personal wealth?\n          Over five billion dollars!  And if you\n          guys get the jump on his - in no time,\n          the market's wide-open.\n\nNedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          But, boy, he's really got his product!\n          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-\n          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that\n          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!\n\nNedry LAUGH\nS explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.\n\nBaker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.\n\nNedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs\ntoward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and\nsqueezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his\nhand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone\nand desperate Nedry.\n\n                            BAKER\n          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is\n          not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-\n          evaluation.\n\nBakers kneels down next to Nedry, who is beginning to turn blue.\n\n                            BAKER\n          The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.\n\nBaker glances at his watch.\n\n                            BAKER\n          I'll give you a few minutes to decide.\n\nNedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back\nand SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.\n\nNedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up\n, rubbing his belly.  As\nBaker leaves the room:\n\n                            BAKER\n          Make sure the eggs are on that supply\n          ship.  Just make sure!\n\nCAMERA LEAVES NEDRY and exits the window.    IT SWISHPANS the concrete\ncanyons of Wall Street and enters another office.\n\n\nINT  CONSERVATIVE LAW OFFICE - DAY\n\nDONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly\npolished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a\npowerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm.\n\n                            ROSS\n          We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's\n          under too much pressure.  There's the\n          EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-\n          vestors are getting nervous.  There have\n          been too many rumors, too many accidents.\n          We can't screw around with this.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          I've asked Hammond to arrange independent\n          site inspections every week for the next\n          three weeks.\n\n                            ROS\nS\n          What does he say?\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Insists nothing's wrong on the island.\n\n                            ROSS\n          You know him.  Do you believe him?\n\n                             GENNARO\n          No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with\n          him five years ago when we raised the\n          capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's\n          unpredictable, a dreamer.\n\n                            ROSS\n          Potentially dangerous.  We should never\n          have gotten involved.

We all\n          wanted the park to happen.  It was in\n          lieu of fees.\n\n                            ROSS\n        \n  In any case, I agree an inspection is\n          overdue.  Who are your site experts?\n\nGennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.\n\n                            ROSS\n          Will they tell the truth?\n\n                            GENNARO\n          I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot\n          in his field, always goes his own way -\n\n                            ROSS\n          - Good.  You're making all the arrangements?\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Hammond asked to place the calls himself.\n          I think he wants to pretend the park is\n          not in trouble.  That it's just a social\n          invitation, showing off the island.\n\n                            ROSS\n          All right ... Good.  But let's be very\n          clear about one thing.  I don't know how\n          bad this situation actually is, Donald.\n          But if there's a problem on that island -\n          don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn\n          Jurassic Park to the ground.\n\nGennaro shakes hands \nawkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-\nup, he whispers to himself.\n\n                            ROSS\n          Costa Rica, my ass.\n\nHe whacks his desk globe, sends its spinning.\n\nCAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a\nhelicopter and DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nINT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN\n\nOn the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.\n\nINSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie\ndozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his\ndiscomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the\nclear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a\ncandy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.\n\nGrant loses himself, looking out the window.\n\nGRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there\nare the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.\nSuddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.\n\nThere is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the\nwindow.  \nThere is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping\na dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the\nisland below them eerily fits right into her doodling.\n\n                            PILOT\n          That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the\n          descent is a little hairy.\n\nGennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes\nout a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          This is exciting!\n\n                            GRANT\n          What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?\n\nGrant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the\nwater.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply\n\n                            GRANT\n          Looks like Alcatraz.\n\nThe pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.\n\n                            PILOT\n          There's bad wind shear on this peak.\n\nGrant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.\n\nEllie\n smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down.  Now, A BLANKET\nFOG.  Grant can't see a thing out his window.  Ellie's startled.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          How the hell is he landing this thing?\n\nNo answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through\nthe mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          This is not fun.\n\nGrant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant\nglowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't\n          land if it weren't safe.\n\nThe copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.\nGennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,\n          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!\n\nAnother violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.\n\nCLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a \npacket of crackers.\n\nGennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.\nHe speaks a mantra.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          No problem.  Relax, relax.\n\nThe pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails\nsharply the other way.\n\n                            GRANT AND ELLIE\n          Whoa!!!!\n\nCLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.\n\nTHE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours\nacross the floor.\n\nNedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang\nsuspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.\n\nGrant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,\n\n                            ELLIE\n          I don't like this feeling ...\n\nThe pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.\nTrees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.\nEllie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.\n\nIN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose\nlow, fo\nr a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal\nbucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches\ndown on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.\n\nFor a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.\nGennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.\n\nGrant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.\nNedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Just think, Gennaro -\n              (laughs harder)\n          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,\n          they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,\n          isn't it?\n\nNedry pats Grant on his shoulder.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.\n\nNedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.\n\nA smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his\nhands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.\n\n      \n                      PILOT\n          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a\n          storm alert.\n\nROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball\ncap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He\nshakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.\nHe throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla\n          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little\n          tough landing here, I know.  But you did\n          it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have\n          you.  Now, watch your step.\n\nEllie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.\n\n\nEXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING\n\nGrant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the\nopposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:\nhuge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;\nrushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds\na\nnd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant\nand Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.\n\nThen, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon\ndirects A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back\nthe abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon\nover.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.\n\n                            ED REGIS\n          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big\n          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.\n          Doing a bang-up job, too.\n\nMuldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.\n          Gennaro, nice to have you back.\n\nGennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.\n\nRegis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old\nfriend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and\nEllie study everything they see.  Grant\n calls to Regis but is ignored.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?\n\nEllie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path\nthey just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Aggressive growth, huh?\n\n                            GRANT\n          Hammond's trademark.\n\nA distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and\nEllie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Out animals are greeting you!\n\nThey pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.\nGrant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic\n          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Nope.\n\nGennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm\nthat leads to the \nVISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.\n\nEllie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.\n\nTHEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.\nThe needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.\n\nThis fence is only the prelude.\n\nSprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.\nWoven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical\nwire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN\nTHOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!\n\nCAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the\nhighest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.\n\nGrant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.\n\nThey reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade\ntrees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off\nthe walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper\ntruck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.\n\n                       \n     REGIS\n          I hope you brought your bathing suits!\n          Doesn't this mist and these plants really\n          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?\n\nRegis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.\n\n                            REGIS\n          There's the Visitor's Center.\n\nA CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.\n\n\nINT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY\n\nCLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.\nAbove, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.\n\nGrant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,\nEllie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.\n\nThe Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed\ngirders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where\nthe back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,\nexhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL\nSPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.\n\n                            GRANT\n     \n     Where's Hammond?\n\n                            REGIS\n          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.\n\nGrant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the\n          air conditioning sucks.\n\nRegis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the\nfinished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.\n\nGrant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the\nWorld.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours\nin a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the\ndinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          The audicity of man to get here at the\n          last second and think he runs the show.\n\nGrant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted\nmural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.\n\nNedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change\n.  It doesn't work.  He\nSLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.\nUpside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.\n\nTHE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a\ncatwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are\nlocked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies\nare scattered all around.\n\nRegis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.\n\nAt that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.\nA soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.\n\n                            VOICE (ON P.A.)\n          Please come to the theater.  In a moment,\n          our film will begin.\n\nThe voice goes on to give this information in a number of languages.\nRegis waves everyone into the theater.   Nedry doesn't join them.  He\nclimbs the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\nINT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY\n\nSmall and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and\nEllie sit further behind. \n Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.\n\nCELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage\nfloor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.\noverall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.\n\nyears young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own\neffect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast\npocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome\n          to an ancient and mysterious world, a\n          world long before humankind inhabited it\n          with all out remarkable dreams and\n          questions.  Enter a world that existed\n          one hundred million years ago.  When our\n          changing earth was the abode of\n          magnificent creations.\n\n          Today, the late twentieth century has\n          witnessed a scientific gold rush of\n          astonishing proportions:  the headlong\n          and furious haste to un\nravel the mystery\n          of genetic engineering has become more\n          than just a subject for science fiction\n          writers.\n\nON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie.\n\n                            GRANT\n          - the furious haste to commercialize\n          genetic engineering.\n\nBACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Biotechnology promises the greatest\n          revolution in human history.  It will\n          outdistance atomic power and computers in\n          its effects on our everyday lives.  We'll\n          see square trees for easy lumbering and\n          white trout for super visibility to\n          fisherman.  Why it will transform every\n          aspect of human life: out medical care,\n          our food, our health, even our very\n          entertainment.\n\nON GRANT - confirmed in his thinking, he whispers again.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Here we go.\n\nBACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          \nNothing will ever be the same again.\n          It's literally going to change the face\n          of our planet as we know it.\n\n\nMUSIC SOARS.  Hammond smiles appreciatively, removes his rose.  A screen\ndescends behind him.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          ... Jurassic Park.  What we do here is\n          made possible through the miracle of DNA\n          replication, commonly known as cloning.\n          To explain what cloning means, I'm going\n          to need my own clone - John Hammond.\n\nAnother Hammond appears, projected on the screen beside the real one.\n\n                            2ND HAMMOND\n          Hi, John!\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Hi, John.\n\nIN THE AUDIENCE - Ellie laughs aloud.  Grant, shaking his head, smiles.\n\nBACK ON HAMMOND - The original speaks to the clone.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Okay John, hold out your finger.\n\n                            2ND HAMMOND\n          Why?\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I need some of your\n genetic material.\n\n                            2ND HAMMOND\n          Now just a minute here, John.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Your genetic material is the same in\n          every cell of your body.  You have a\n          hundred billion cells.  You won't miss a\n          couple.\n\nHammond holds his rose to the screen the pricks his clone's finger with\na thorn.\n\n                            2ND HAMMOND\n          OW!!!  That hurt!  Hey, what's -\n\nThe clone dissolves into a cascade of blood as WE SEE a magnified view\nof the bloodstream.  ANIMATION begins which illuminates the parts of the\nblood and its actions.  Hammond provides voiceover for the visuals.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          John, let's look into your blood, the\n          river of life.  There's your white cells,\n          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily\n          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,\n          the heart and brain of a cell.  This\n          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can\n          sp\nlit in half and reproduce itself.\n          That's how it grows.  And then those two\n          can do it again.  And again.  Making copy\n          after copy of itself.\n\nBack to the two Hammond's.  Joined by a third, then a fourth, and so on\nuntil the screen is crammed with Hammond's, elbowing each other for room.\n\n                            NEW HAMMOND'S\n          Hi, I'm John Hammond.  Hey, I'm John\n          Hammond.  No, I am.  I am.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Come on, that's enough of this!  And I\n          thought to reproduce myself I had to do it\n          the old-fashioned way.\n\nNew mist fades out this show.  The lights go up.  Regis applauds.  Grant\njoins in the laughter with Ellie and Gennaro.\n\nHammond jumps down from the stage and greets Gennaro and Regis.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          That's all we've got so far.  A lot of\n          fun, isn't it, Mr. Gennaro?\n\n                            REGIS\n          You bet!\n\nHammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly.  Then \nHammond baits Grant.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          It's been a long time, Alan.  I know the\n          preceding was not your sort of enter-\n          tainment.  Popular science -\n\n                            GRANT\n          No, I don't mind popular science.  I dislike\n          the commercialization of science.  It breeds\n          a sloppiness, a disregard for method.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Well, I don't disregard method.  But think\n          of mutation - which is nothing more than\n          sloppy communication on the cellular\n          level.  Think how triumphant mutations\n          have been in natural selection.\n\n          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's\n          true that I have never been afraid to make\n          money with science.  I've always\n          considered profit to be a measure of\n          success, a barometer of public reaction.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Mr. Hammond, the essential truth of a\n          scientific law ha\ns nothing to do with\n          public reaction.  Water freezes at\n          thirty-two degrees, whether you pay for\n          it or not.\n\nHammond turns to Gennaro.  Gennaro smiles nervously at their clash.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Donald, in bringing my old friend, Alan\n          Grant, you've brought an excellent critic\n          to observe the viability of my island and\n          out venture.  I look forward to winning\n          you over, Dr. Grant.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Just what is it you're trying to clone?\n\n\nEXT  A SPRAWLING LAWN - DAY\n\nOutside, Hammond leads Gennaro, Grant and Ellie.  He points out the\nstaff living quarters, a group of graceful teepees.  Next to their\nhomes, WORKERS hang laundry and cook on grills.\n\nThey pass a large Mechanical Building.  The generator housed within is\nvery LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.\n\nSuddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.\n\nRacing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is \nat\nthe steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.\nThey are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.\n\n                            LEX\n          Grandpa!\n\nHammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.  Gennaro pulls him close.\n\n                            GENNARO\n              (incredulous)\n          Mr. Hammond, this is a serious investiga-\n          tion of the island, not a weekend\n          excursion or a social outing.  We're\n          talking about the safety of this place!\n\nHammond waves to the children.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I'm aware of that.  But I built this\n          place for children.  You can't\n          investigate it without their reactions.\n          They're what this place is all about.\n\nHammond beams to Grant and Ellie and indicates the running kids.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          My grandchildren.  Genetics were kind.\n          They're more like my ex-wife than me.\n\nLex jumps right into her Grandpa's arms.  Timmy s\nhyly walks up and\nembraces him.  Hammond shines.  Gennaro holds in his fury.\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\nHammond ushers his guests into his own richly appointed baronial suite.\nEllie looks out a small window at the tee-pees and the contrasting\nlifestyle below.  She then focuses on the high fence, circling the\nperimeter of Hammond's quarters.  Above is a skylight, with metal bars.\n\nGrant whispers to her, indicating the obviously modified window frame.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Who makes a windows ... smaller?\n\nTimmy smacks him forehead, points to Grant.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          I know you.

He wrote if for\n          gra\nduate students.\n\nHammond smiles intensely.  But he's patient.  He stands be a huge table\ncovered with a sumptuous velvet drape.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise,\n          this is not an ill-conceived, half-baked,\n          poorly funded plan that I've headed.\n          This is a plan to which I committed all\n          of my personal resources, literally\n          billions of dollars.  And Donald Gennaro\n          here has kindly helped me raise that sum\n          again from wealthy Japanese.  They love\n          theme parks.

Imagine that ancient sap\n          trapping a little struggling insect and\n          consuming it in a syrupy death.

And as we examine more and\n          more amber, we find many perished insects,\n          including among them, biting insects -\n\n                            GRANT\n          Like mosquitos -\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Like mosquitos, precisely, Dr. Grant.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Mosquitos that sucked the blood of\n          dinosaurs.

Right?\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Right.  You are witnessing the extraction\n          of tissue from the thorax of this humble\n          insect.  If this mosquito has ingested any\n          foreign red blood cells - say it bit a\n          hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex -  we\n          will extract those blood cells and obtain\n          paleo-DNA, the how-to-build instruction\n          book of an extinct creature.\n          So you see, Ellie, I'm not creating dino-\n          saurs.

More like\n          hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are\n          necessary to provide even a partial\n          strand of DNA.

He's a naysayer.  I have\n          no affection for that type of thinking.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Don't worry.  Ellie makes her own\n          judgments.\n\nAt the base of the hill Timmy and Lex toss a baseball.\n\n\nEXT  TOUR START - DAY\n\nThe group gathers.  TWO ELECTRIC CARS glide to a stop behind them.\nRegis leans out of the first one.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Hey!  Great day for a tour!\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Looks like rain to me.\n\n         \n                   REGIS\n          No!  I told the rain-god to hold it off\n          till we got back.\n\nThe kids pile in next to Regis and explore the high-tech cars.  Timmy\nfinds a a pair of very think, strange-looking goggles with dials on top.\n\nGrant, Ellie, and Gennaro climb in the second car.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Kids, mind Mr. Regis.  He's in charge now.\n\nThe cars begin to move and pass Hammond.  He waves.\n\nGennaro looks back as the cars turn into the brush.  Hammond waves.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Gennaro, for once in your life, let\n          something really move you.\n\nIn the cruiser, Gennaro rubs his neck.  He turns to Grant.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Ever get the feeling we're just Hammond's\n          damn guinea pigs?\n\n                            GRANT\n          I like to wait and see.\n\nEllie motions ahead, with excitement and apprehension, to a huge gate.\nRegis and the kids wave behind to Grant, Ellie and Gennaro.\n\nThe gate's doo\nrs swing open and the cruisers move forward.  The kids\nsqueal out a YA-HOO that floats through the air to Grant.  But Grant\nwears a cautious face, his skeptical eyes scan the landscape.\n\nA FANFARE of trumpets and then a pre-recorded voice speaks from a\nconsole in each cruiser.  Video screens display a welcome message.\n\n                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE\n          Welcome to Jurassic Park.  You are now\n          entering the lost world of the\n          prehistoric past, a world of mighty\n          creatures long gone from the face of the\n          earth, which you are privileged to see\n          for the first time ...\n\nRegis uses his walkie-talkie to contact Grant's cruiser.\n\n                            REGIS (ON WALKIE)\n          That's Richard Kiley.

Below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.\n\n                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE\n          ... and the grasses are a species of\n          juniper, and samples can be purchased at\n          the gift shop.  Now, if everyone will\n          take a look to the right ...\n\nAll eyes swing that way.  Grant doesn't see a thing.  Nor do the others.\n\nAHEAD, Timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies\nthe location.  Lex grabs the night goggles.  Timmy pulls them from her.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Look ...\n\n                            LEX AND TIMMY\n          I don't see anything.  Do you see\n          anything?  There's nothing there.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Something's out there ...\n\nIN THE SECOND CAR, a fly buzzes on Grant's windshield.  Grant hangs out\nhis window almost sniffing the air for some movement.  Nothing.\n\nSUDDENLY the trees in front of them move!  A deep trumpeting SOUND and\nTWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr\nom the side of the road.  The ground\nSHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the\npassengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up\nat the dinosaurs far above.\n\nDROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.  Utter\namazement fills Grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile\nthen a laugh.  He simply can't believe his eyes. His laugh becomes\nraucous and euphoric.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Ellie!  Can you imagine the excavation\n          team seeing this!\n\nBehind him, Ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile.  Gennaro\nsquints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality.\n\nIN THE CAR AHEAD, Lex and Timmy stare open-mouthed.  Regis looks at the\nanimal and then at the group's reverie.  He smiles knowingly: he's been\nthere, too.  He bends and whispers:\n\n                            REGIS\n          Congratulations. You're the first kids in\n          the whole wide world ever to see real\n          dinosaurs.\n\nThe\n kids look up at Regis with wonder in their eyes.\n\nGRANT CAN'T stop laughing.  Still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to\npeer at this laughing man.  The brachiosaur's huge head stops inches\naway from Grant.  Grant, awestruck, stares and them -\n\nCLOSE ON - Grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints.\n\nThe dinosaur casually moves away as Ellie comes to Grant's aid.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Alan?  Alan?\n              (sort of delighted)\n          He fainted!\n\nGennaro waves to Regis that all is okay.  Grant slowly revives.  He\nlooks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away.  He looks at\nEllie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a\nlook of serene delight.\n\nGennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him.  A\nglazed look fills his face.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          My God, we're going to make a fortune\n          here!\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN on the majestic, gentle beauty of the Brachiosaurs.\nJUNGLE SOUNDS DOMINATE, growing l\nouder and louder.\n\n\nINT CONTROL ROOM - DAY\n\nHammond sits at his throne, happily watching the huge video screen which\ndisplays the tour group.  He laughs raucously and calls to Arnold.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          He fainted.

In the distance, A HERD OF GALLIMIMUS\ngraze.  They stand on their hind legs to get at high palm trees, then\ndrop gracefully down on all fours to chew.  BABY GALLIMIMUS scamper\naround the adults, eating leaves that drop from the larger animals.\n\n                             PRE-RECORDED VOICE\n          ...

He is simply intoxicated with the pastoral beauty\nof the gentle, grazing dinosaurs.  Suddenly, he looks away with a deep\nconcern.  Ellie looks at him questioningly.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Ellie?

But as we come\n          alongside out Jurassic jungle river to the\n          left, let's try and catch a glimpse of a\n          very unusual and dangerous carnivore.\n          Look across the river and above ...\n\nA lovely mossy clearing.  And to the side, bounded just by a thicket of\nbushes, a precipitous drop to a tropical river, lus\nh and clear.  The\nriver runs fast but it is narrow.  On the other side is a sharp rise.\n\n                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE\n          And there they are!\n\nStanding on that natural pedestal and watching our tour come to a stop\nare TWO DILOPHOSAURUS, man-sized dinosaurs with gills that hang around\ntheir necks.

Scientists once thought\n          their jaw muscles were too weak to kill,\n          but now, through the miracle of their\n          cloning, we know Dilophosaurs spit venom,\n          a poison which causes blindness and then\n          unconsciousness.\n\nTheir distinctive HOOT drifts across the afternoon air.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Poisonous d\ninosaurs, there's a liability\n          issue without a lot of precedent.\n\nCLOSEUP of the nearly motionless Dilophosaurus.

Suddenly, a\ndark claw pushes against the wire web. A SHOWER OF SPARKS.  A SCREECH\nanimals GROWL and SNARL.  An animal slams its face into the mesh.  SPARKS\nilluminate a set of RAZOR-SHARP TEETH.\n\nMuldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle.\nHammond comes in a hurry.  Muldoon sees Hammond and puts down the rifle.\nHe walks to Hammond, talking before he gets there.\n\n               \n             MULDOON\n          These raptors are too damn dangerous. One\n          of them tunneled out this morning.  He\n          ripped a boy's arm off before I could get\n          a bullet in him.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          A bullet?  Muldoon - no!  Now what?  I\n          have five left?\n\n                            MULDOON\n          John, they're mean as scorpions and smart\n          as chimps.  Their little fingers make\n          them natural cage-breakers.  We should\n          terminate the raptor program.  They're\n          just too smart.  Too damn smart.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Oh balls.  I will not terminate the raptors\n          just because they're behaving normally.\n          They're hunters.  Why can't we contain them\n          properly?\n\nHammond starts to walk away.  Muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          John, remember back in '88, when we\n          started to build the containment devices?\n         \n We ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns\n          that blow out electric nets.  They're all\n          too slow for these guys. If we're going\n          to keep the raptors, I want TOW missiles\n          and laser-guided devices.\n\nHammond laughs warmly.  He pats Muldoon on the back.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          It's just a zoo, Muldoon.  A zoo.  Figure\n          out a way to contain them.  And we'll sit\n          down and have a nice long discussion about\n          raptors - after my guests leave, okay?\n\nHammond walks away.  Muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his\nhand.  Muldoon lumps over to A WORKER.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Okay!  Get a 'dozer, start digging round\n          the pit.  We're gonna bury some fence.\n          And wear your rifle when you're working!\n\n\nINT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nHammond enters and crosses to his throne.

You casually accept it, but\n          I never can.  You know what it means when\n          you say \"by the trikes\"?  \"By the\n          trike's\" means that they're out there by\n          the species:  triceratops horridus.  It\n          astounds me every time what I've done\n          here.  What magic, what alchemy.  We\n          turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur.\n          I will never be complacent about that.\n\nArnold smiles and punches a button.  WE HEAR the pre-recorded tour voice\nand some chatter of the kids.\n\nEAVESDROPPING on the tour IS INTERRUPTED by a radio transmission to the\ncontrol room.

Nedry quietly gets up.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Coffee anyone?\n\nHe's ignored.  Arnold defers to Hammond who leans to the microphone.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Hello skipper, John Hammond, how are you\n          tonight?  I certainly don't want to\n          imperil anyone.  But can you give us one\n          more container of food?  Then we'll feel\n          comfortable is the storm delays your\n          return.  Could you help us out here?  Of\n          course, if it looks too choppy just go,\n          but you'd be doing us a big favor.\n\n                 \n           RADIO\n          Well ... we'll do our best, sir.  We'll\n          get one more container off. How's that?\n\nHammond thanks him and signs off.  Arnold looks at the darkening clouds.\n\n\nINT/EXT  CRUISERS, FOURTH TOUR STOP - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThe cars twist through dense vegetation with a GRINDING of gears.  The\nfirst car comes to a jerky stop.\n\nThere is a huge TRICERATOPS lying on its side, moving very slowly,\nbreathing laboriously.  HARDING, the tall, balding park vet, kneels on\nthe ground.  He peers into the animal's mouth with a large flashlight.\n\nBefore the second car can stop completely, Grant leaps out, races to the\ntrike.  Regis tries to restrain the kids but they chase Grant and Ellie.\n\nGrant joins Harding on the ground.  The trike lets out a low MOAN.\nShe's too sick to move.  Ellie and Lex squat by the animal.\n\n                            LEX\n          I feel so sorry for her.

What's the matter?  Ellie,\n          look at this.\n\nA dark purple tongue droops limply from her mouth.  Ellie shines the\nlight on it, illuminating silvery blisters.

Timmy quietly follows Grant.\n\nEllie lifts a huge eyelid on the triceratops.  A runny eye just stares.\n\nGrant comes up triumphantly with a bouquet of weeds clutched in his\nhand.  These weeds have little purple berries.

Good\n          work, Timmy.\n\nEllie gets up, brushes herself off, comes over and examines the stone.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Extremely smooth.  Purple stains, could\n          be those lilac berries.\n\nShe and Grant smile and each other and nod.

Automatically, with a soft hiss, the glass roofs\nof the cruisers slide shit.  Gennaro taps Regis and indicates the cars.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Hey Regis, where are your rain gods?\n          It's gonna pour.  Let's finish our tour.\n\nGrant agrees, heads for the cruisers.  He turns and looks for Ellie.\nEllie stands by the Trike.  She gives Grant a meaningful look.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          I'm staying.\n\nGrant smiles at her decision.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Soil samples?\n\n                            ELLIE\n          You read my mind.\n              (confidentially)\n          I think she's sicker then they're saying.\n          Her skin is dry and flaky.  And her gums\n          are pale.  I'm going to talk to Dr. Wu.\n\n        \n                    GRANT\n          Good idea.  I'll keep my eyes open.\n\nGennaro climbs in with Grant.  The two cruisers start off and Timmy\nturns backward to stare wistfully at Grant.  Regis and Lex wave to the\nTrike.  Grant looks back to Ellie who has already begun to work.\n\nON TRIKE - a mosquito lands on its back.  The trike's tail slaps it dead.\n\n\nINT  MACHINE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nWith difficulty, Nedry shoves his large body down the crawl space behind\na large rack of electronic equipment.  He stops and uses a suction cup\ndevice to lift a section of the tiled floor.  He gropes among cables and\npulls out a small wireless radio.  He transmits:\n\n                            NEDRY (INTO RADIO)\n          Jim, what the hell's with you  ... I know\n          a storm's coming, I can't ... it's all so\n          tightly planned ... that's not enough ...\n          ok, twenty minutes, I'll be there.  Damn!\n\nNedry returns the radio to its hiding place.  He sucks in his gut to\nmake the crawl out of  the narrow space.\n\n\nINT/EXT  CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA - DUSK\n\nThe cruisers stop on the rise of a hill.  They over look a forested area,\nsloping down to the edge of the lagoon.\n\n                            TOUR\n          The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosaur\n          history.  Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a\n          hundred and twenty million years, but\n          there were tyrannosaurs for only the last\n          fifteen million years of that period ...\n\nFarther south, they see the graceful necks of the brachiosaurs standing\nat the water's edge.  Their bodies, mirrored in the moving surface,\nbreak apart with the continuing drops of rain.  Hear lightning rhythmic-\nally pulses the sky.  All is quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas\nand the tapping of light rain.\n\nRegis calls Grant on the walkie-talkie.\n\n                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)\n          You know, Dr. Grant, Hammond likes to\n          come here in the evening and just sit.\n\n                            GRANT (OVER WALKIE)\n          Where is the T-\nRex?\n\n                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)\n          Good question.\n\nON GRANT - as he takes that in, nodding to himself. Studies the land.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Maybe she's down hunting apatosaurs.\n\nOVER WALKIE - Regis laughs, his voice tinny over the radio.\n\n                            REGIS (OVER WALKIE)\n          Would if she could, believe me.  Some-\n          times she stands by the lagoon and stares\n          at those animals, and wiggles those\n          little forearms of hers in frustration.\n          But the T-Rex territory is completely\n          enclosed with trenches and fences.\n          Believe me, she can't go anywhere.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Then where is she?\n\nThey hear A SOFT BLEATING.  In the center of the field, a small cage\nrises into view, lifted on hydraulics from underground.  The cage bars\nslide down.  A GOAT remains tethered in the field, BLEATING plaintively.\n\nThe tour group stares out their windows, expectantly.\n\n\nBACK ON CONTRO\nL ROOM -\n\nHammond, pleased, watches the giant screen that displays the tour group.\nMuldoon limps into the control room.  Arnold looks over.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Just checking in.  Everything ok?\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Look at them.  Leaning out the windows,\n          so eager.  They can't wait to see it.\n          They have come for the danger.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          That's what I'm afraid of.\n\nMuldoon twirls the keys on his fingers and watches the land cruisers.\n\n\nBACK ON CRUISERS, T-REX FEEDING AREA -\n\nGrant watches quietly.\n\nThe BLEATING becomes louder, more insistent.  The goat tugs frantically\nat its tether, racing back and forth, kicking.\n\n                            LEX\n          What's going to happen to the goat?  Is\n          the T-Rex gonna come eat the goat?\n\nGrant senses something.  He sits straight up.  Looks out intently.\n\n                            GRANT\n          He's here.\n\nThe goat is tethered in the middle of the fi\neld, thirty yards from the\nnearest tree.  Grant scans the tree for the T-Rex.\n\nThe goat senses something too.  It struggles and strains, bleating\nfrantically.  Suddenly the mechanical SOUND of the cage coming up.  Its\nbars surround the goat with safety once again.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Looks like the Rex will have its snack a\n          little later today.\n\n                            RECORDED VOICE\n          The sensors don't see the Rex around.\n          She usually comes within five minutes of\n          hearing dinner. If she doesn't, that\n          means she's sleeping - we might have\n          access to her at the picnic area.\n\nLex and Timmy let out a sigh of relief.  The tension is gone.\n\n                            LEX\n          I didn't want to see him get eaten.  I\n          liked the goat.\n\n\nBACK IN THE CONTROL ROOM -\n\nHammond studies the large video monitor.  He watches Grant and Gennaro.\nTheir voices are heard in the control room.\n\n                            GENNARO (MONITOR\nED)\n          What is a carnivore got out?\n\n                            GRANT (MONITORED)\n          There'd be no stopping it.  Huge, with no\n          natural enemies, and a suppressed hunting\n          instinct.\n\nHammond glares.  Arnold, aware, shuts off the screen.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Damn those people.  They are so negative.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          It's natural.  They can't fully\n          appreciate that we've engineered the\n          animals and the park for total safety.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          They comb this island like a bunch of\n          accountants.  They don't experience the\n          wonder, the awe of it all.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          You can't make people experience wonder.\n\nHammond gets up and stands before the big windows overlooking the park.\nThe quartz FLOODLIGHTS outside their area COME ON with a rosy glow and\nthe dark jungle is opened again to their inspection.\n\nAt his console, Nedry looks at Hamm\nond.  Hammond stares out the window.\nThe RAIN PICKS UP and bounces off the window.  Hammond speaks to Arnold\nwithout turning.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          It's like the Garden of Eden out there.\n          This is the most beautiful time of day.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Better rout the tour back.  They can\n          start again sun-up tomorrow morning.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Yup.  Call the kitchen.  Those kids'll be\n          hungry when they get in.\n\nArnold picks up the phone.  STATIC.  He glances over at Nedry.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Sorry 'bout that.  I've taken all the\n          lines to upload some data.\n\nHammond's annoyed, but contains it.  Arnold looks at Nedry, who smiles.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          I'll clear a couple of lines for you at\n          the end of the next transmission, sir.\n          Here you go now, this will make it all\n          better, Mr. Hammond.\n\nNedry punches in a code.\n\nCLOSE ON \n- Nedry's fat finger punching a last key.\n\nCLOSE ON - amber video display terminal as a countdown begins.\n\nAs the screen counts down from ten to zero, Nedry peers at Hammond with\na steely glint in his eyes.\n\nBACK ON SCREEN - three, two, one, the countdown hits zero.\n\nNedry's data-filled screen blinks off.  Nedry looks up to the rack of\nmonitors.  Unnoticed by Hammond or Arnold two more monitors go blank.\nThen a third one.\n\n\nBACK  ON CRUISERS, REST AREA - NIGHT\n\nThe electric cars turn up into a scenic area high above the rest of the\npark.  HUGE QUARTZ LIGHTS REVEAL a dramatic view down to the ocean.\nThere the supply ship, the ANNE B, unloads its last crates.\n\nRAIN INCREASES.  On the other side of the road are picnic tables, an\nunfinished snack bar and rest rooms.  To the side of this rest area is a\nview of the interior of the island.  A guard-rail separates visitors\n\nTo the other side of the rest area is a concrete moat and in the back of\nthis is a tall, electrified fence.  Surrounding the electric fence is a\n\nsmaller protective fence.\n\n                            PRE-RECORDED VOICE\n          ... enjoy a healthy snack.

Grant\ngets out of his cruiser, strides to Regis.  He indicates the fence.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Is that still the T-Rex paddock?\n\n                            REGIS\n          Yes.  But she never comes here.  I don't\n          know why not.  Probably too much\n          construction.\n\nGENNARO, jacket over his head against the rain, looks down to the ocean.\n\nGENNARO'S POV - THE ANNE B UNLOADS he last cargo crate.\n\nGRANT LOOKS at the concrete moat.  Studies its deep curve.  He looks up\nat the tell electrical fence with its 10,000 volt warning.  He sees\nconventional power lines on the opposite sid\ne of the road.\n\nCAMERA EXAMINES the empty cruisers.  Inside, the pre-recorded voice is\nchatting on.  It slows eerily and stops.  Video SCREENS BLINK OUT.\n\n\nBACK ON CONTROL ROOM -\n\nNedry yawns loudly.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Yup!  Looks like a never-ending weekend\n          for me.  I'm gonna get a Diet Coke.\n          Don't touch my console, ok?  Line will\n          be clear in five minutes.\n\nNedry leaves.  Hammond swings around and growls under his breath.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Slob!\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Well, at least he knows what he's doing.\n\n\nINT  UPPER FLOOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - NIGHT\n\nNedry races through the series of security doors.  He ignores the\nsecurity x-ray device and just SHOVES each door open with his hand.\n\n\nBACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -\n\nTHE QUARTZ LIGHTS GO OUT, leaving the group in shadowy darkness and now\nSTEADY RAIN.  There's a ripple of surprise from the group.  Regis rounds\nthem all up and directs them back into the \ncruisers.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Everything's just fine.  It's a temporary\n          glitch due to the rain.  No doubt,\n          they're going to re-rout some circuits\n          back at the mainframe.  We'll have the\n          power back on in moments.  Let's get back\n          in the cruisers, they may start up, and\n          I'd like us all to be seated in them.\n\nThe cruisers are STILL.  IN THE REAR CRUISER, Gennaro turns to Grant.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          I knew we shouldn't have kids here.\n\nA vivid FLASH of LIGHTNING.  IN THE FIRST CAR:  Lex covers her eyes.\nThen she looks up at Regis with a frightful face.\n\n                            LEX\n          Mr. Regis, are dinosaurs ... nocturnal?\n\n                            REGIS\n          No, darling, of course not.\n\n                            LEX\n          Mr. Regis?  What's ... nocturnal?\n\nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH.  Lex cries.  Regis comforts her.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Don't you worry about d\ninosaurs.  They're\n          all very safe in their paddocks just like\n          animals in a big, strong zoo.  They're not\n          going anywhere we don't tell them to go.\n\nTimmy looks out the window excitedly.\n\n\nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT\n\nAll those eggs on tables.  No moving sensors.  Nedry pulls a portable\nincubator away from the dozens lined up against the wall.  Its\nelectrical cord goes flying.  Furiously, Nedry fills the incubator with\neggs, one after the other.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Okay, little ones!  Here we go!\n\nNedry grabs the handles of the incubator and runs with it.  The\nincubator careens on one wheel as he turns the corner and exits.\n\n\nBACK ON CONTROL ROOM -\n\nHammond looks out the large window as the LIGHTS EXTINGUISH.  He twirls.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          What's going on, Arnold?  I want those\n          lights on.

Someone\n          has been in my laboratory and the eggs\n          have been disturbed.\n\nThe camera pushes in on Hammond's face.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Where the hell is Nedry?  Where is he?\n          Did anybody check the damn john?\n\nHammond storms out.\n\n\nINT  CORRIDOR, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION\n\nHammond enters the hall.  Muldoon, racing from the other direction, yells:\n\n                            MULDOON\n          John, the generator's shut down.  Who cut\n          the power?\n\n     \n                       HAMMOND\n          Arnold's on it.  You go out and bring\n          back the tour right away.  I don't need\n          any of this!\n\nMuldoon is already running back the way he came.\n\n\nINT  GARAGE - NIGHT\n\nSeveral electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There\nis a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault\nrifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.\n\nTo the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side\nof the front seat is a rocket launcher.\n\nNedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.\nApproaching FOOTSTEPS.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Oh, shit!\n\n\nINT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -\n\nMuldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the\ndoor to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.\n\nBACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.\nWheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With\neverything he's got, he lifts the incub\nator waist-height.  And holds it.\n\nBACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer\nto the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket\ncatches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.\n\nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.\n\nBACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll\ndown his brow.\n\nMULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.\n\nNedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty\npalms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful\nboost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.\n\nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.\n\nNERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and\nthat.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the\nincubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.\n\nAt that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.\n\nNEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  \nNedry's frightened face.\n\nMULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He\ntakes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.\n\nNEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,\nand zooms into the night.\n\nA moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust\nthat still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his\njeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his\nface straining to understand.\n\n\nEXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT\n\nNedry's red jeep flies down the park road.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.\n\nHis tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a\nsmaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.\n\nNedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric\nfence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!\n\nTwo safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to\nthe first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,\nand another.  It f\nits.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.\n\nNedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the\nground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the\nmuddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.\n\nHe races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his\nface.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.\n\nHe grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.\n\nNedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.\nHe jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates\nmove recklessly in the stormy night.\n\n\nBACK ON GARAGE\n\nEllie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is\nwaiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding\njumps out of the jeep.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.\n          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,\n          Hammond'll fill you in.\n\nEllie is concerned, the\nn decisive.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.\n\nThey race out.\n\n\nEXT  DOCK - NIGHT\n\nHeadlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the\ndock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.\n\nNedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to\ndrag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet\nhim, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry\nit toward the ship.\n\n                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Nah.  I'm back in five minutes, they'll\n          never know I was gone.\n              (yells after the men with the incubator)\n          Careful with that thing!  It's worth more\n          than the ship.\n              (to the Captain)\n          When's the copter meeting you?\n\n                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,\n       \n   nobody could land on the water.\n\n                            NEDRY\n              (totally panicked)\n          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like\n          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,\n          I don't like it.  I just don't like -\n\n                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at\n          the dock in Puntaremas.  We should be\n          able to make that in time.\n\n                            NEDRY\n              (somewhat relieved)\n          Ten hours?\n\n                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n          Yeah, now relax.  I got a lot riding on\n          this too, you know.  No one's going to\n          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess\n          up.  His people won't let him.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Ok.  Ok.  Here.\n\nNedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Look, this is insulating spray.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his\n hand,\n\n                            NEDRY\n          In about eight hours, spray down all the\n          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em\n          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has\n          it together with the dock.\n\n\nBACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -\n\nRain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex\nstares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles\nand snaps them on.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see\n          in the dark and I can see far.\n\nHe swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.\nHe reaches up and adjusts the knob.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still\n          there?  It is. I think they're getting\n          ready to go.\n\nTIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on\nthe boat.\n\nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Timmy, can you\n give her the goggles?\n\nLex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Want to look at the boat, Lex?\n\nTimmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek\nwith the goggles toward the ocean.\n\n                            LEX\n          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he\n          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?\n\nLEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at\nthe Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.\n\n                            LEX\n          They have one of those things from the\n          room with all the eggs - you know, where\n          they help the baby eggs grow up.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          You mean an incubator?\n\n                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)\n          What's the commotion?\n\n                            REGIS\n          Let me see.  Give them to men, sweetheart.\n\n                            TIMMY (TO WALKIE)\n          Uh, Dr. Grant?\n\nREGIS GRABS th\ne walkie talkie and tries to silence Timmy.  He knows he\ngets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load\n          an incubator onto the ship.\n\n                            LEX (TO WALKIE)\n          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!\n          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!\n\n                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)\n          Nedry?  With an incubator?  Regis??\n\n                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)\n              (finally acknowledges)\n          That's what they saw.\n\nON GRANT - He looks sharply at Gennaro.\n\n                            GRANT (TO WALKIE)\n          We gotta tell Hammond and Arnold right\n          away.  How far is it to the mainland?\n\nON TIMMY - He looks at Regis.\n\n                            REGIS (TO WALKIE)\n          Uh, it's a hundred miles to Puntaremas.\n          About a sixteen hour voyage in this\n          weather.\n\nON GRANT - He fiddles with the radio in his cruiser.  No r\nesponse still.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running\n          around Costa Rica.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          When's the damn power coming on?\n\n\nINT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS\n\nMuldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his\nbrakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the\nroad.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.\n\nAs Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself\nbetween the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs\nand moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.\nAs they struggle.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Strong legs.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Lot of track in college.\n\n\nBACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -\n\nIN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.  Timmy wears\nhis goggles and stares into the rain.  Lex shifts her body around,\ntrying to get comfortable to rest.\n\n \n                           LEX\n          I'm hungry.  When can we get going?\n\n                            REGIS\n          When the electricity comes back on,\n          honey.  These cars run on electric cables\n          buried in the road.\n\nIN THE SECOND CAR, Grant tries the radio to no avail.  Gennaro smokes.\nGrant looks forward toward the first cruiser.  He can barely make out\nthe car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.\n\nTIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.\nHe puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car\nVIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the\nfloor.  The kids look at him.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Must be turning on the electricity.\n\nLex sits up, looks around groggily.\n\n                            LEX\n          Feels like a vibration.\n\n\nINT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT\n\nThe T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after\nthe other in long, powerful strides.\n\n\nBACK ON CRUISE\nRS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER\n\nThere is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.   Tim and Lex share a\nfrightened look.  Now the thud grows LOUDER.  There is a CRASHING SOUND,\nthe whole cruiser SHAKES.  Then silence.  Then another SHAKE.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.\n\nTIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.\n\nTim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and\nthick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.\n\nThe T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.\n\n\nIN THE SECOND CRUISER -\n\nGrant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.\n\n\nCLOSE ON LEX -\n\nTears roll down her cheek.  She cries silently with an unknown fear.\nRegis pulls the goggles from his eyes, starts to gag, checks it.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Jesus Christ.\n\n                            LEX\n          Bad language.\n\n     \n                       REGIS\n          Jesus Christ.  The fence isn't\n          electrified.\n\n                            LEX\n          Is that bad?\n\nRegis turns, looks out the side window, away from the T-Rex.\n\nRegis is shaking uncontrollably.  Suddenly he throws open his door and\nbolts off into the rain, leaving the door open.  No move from the Rex.\n\nRegis races by the second cruiser.  Grant stares out at him.\n\n                            TIM\n          Mr. Regis!  Mr. Regis, where are you\n          going?\n\n                            LEX\n          He just left us.  He just left us all\n          alone.  Timmy, Timmy how could he do\n          that?  We're all alone!  We're all alone!\n\nFLASH OF LIGHTNING.  FLASH.  The Rex butts his head.\n\nTIM'S POV - The fence bangs down on top of his cruiser.\n\nTimmy and Lex recoil from the scrape  of the wire mesh against the car.\n\n\nIN THE SECOND CRUISER -\n\nGRANT AND GENNARO'S POV - through the almost obscuring rain they see the\nfallen fence.  An unseen weight pulls on it fur\nther, causing its\nelectric wire to pop like over-tuned guitar strings.\n\n\nTIMMY REACHES -\n\nout into the rain for the open door handle.\n\nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH and the creature is revealed standing between\nthe two cruisers, atop the crushed fence.  His head turns back and\nforth, he's deciding on his prey.  Grant and Gennaro or Tim and Lex?\n\nTimmy slams the door shut.  He looks directly at the Rex, just a few\nfeet away.  The Rex turns to him, stares back.\n\nLex SCREAMS and Timmy claps a hand over her mouth.\n\nThere is a whisper over Tim's walkie-talkie.\n\n                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)\n          Timmy, be quiet. Don't move.\n\n\nBACK ON GRANT -\n\nHe snaps off the walkie-talkie.\n\nHIS POV - The rain runs in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the\nmuscular hind legs.  The animal's head is out-of-view, above the\nrooftops of the cars.  The Rex lifts its huge hind leg.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Holy shit!  Any suggestions what we do\n          now?\n\n                            GRANT\n        \n  Can't think of a thing.\n\nThe T-Rex slowly circles Grant's cruiser.\n\n\nBACK ON TIM -\n\nHe watches the beast move.\n\n\nBACK ON GRANT AND GENNARO -\n\nAs they twist and turn, trying to find a circling Rex in dark and rain.\nThe Rex pauses right next to Gennaro's window.  He lowers his head,\nlooking for movement inside.\n\nCLOSE ON - the beady, expressionless reptilian eye moving in the socket.\n\nGrant whispers, hardly moving his lips.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Don't move.\n\nGennaro's leg trembles uncontrollably.\n\n\nIN THE FIRST CRUISER -\n\nVery frightened, Lex discovers a flashlight.  She flicks it on and off,\ndistracting herself.  The beam shows her eyes full of a quiet panic.\n\n                            LEX\n          It's too, too dark out there.\n\nTim waves his hands in caution.\n\n\nBACK ON GRANT, GENNARO, AND THE REX -\n\nThe Rex bends down, bumps the windshield with his nose.  Just stays\nthere, breathing heavily.  In the distance, the flashlight goes on\nagain.  The Rex raises his head suddenly.  Grant g\nrabs his walkie.\n\n                            GRANT (TO THE WALKIE)\n          Shut that flashlight, Tim!\n\nAs the Rex heads off, a casual swipe of his tail SMASHES the side of the\ncruiser, throwing Grant and Gennaro across the inside of the car.\n\n\nON TIM -\n\nHe lunges for the flashlight.  Lex dodges him, keeps it lit.\n\n                            LEX\n          No, it's mine.  Please, I need it.\n\nTim looks up through the sun roof.  The massive head of the\nTyrannosaurus Rex appears.  Tim watches, transfixed.  Lex looks up.\nIrrational with terror, she aims her flashlight like a gun.  Blasts him.\nHer flashlight beam cuts through the dark and rain - she sees the beast\nplainly for the first time and SCREAMS!\n\nThe POOL OF LIGHT bathes the Rex's face.  He smashes his head down onto\nthe Plexiglass bubble.  It crunches, and falls into the car, crushing\nthe children.  Tim uses his feet to push it to the side.\n\nAbove, the Rex displays is gaping maw, drooling toward the opening.\n\n\nGRANT -\n\nwatches the Rex raise his mighty h\nead again, above the kids' cruiser.\n\n\nTIMMY AND LEX -\n\nhave a half-instant of relief.  Then SLAM.  The Rex butts his head\nagainst the cruiser.  The Rex comes back down, tries to discover his\nprey inside the cruiser.  Pushes his head close to the glass, looking.\n\nThe dinosaur stands in front of the cruiser, his whole chest heaving,\nhis forelimbs pawing the air.\n\nTimmy whispers to Lex.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Are you ok?  Be quiet and don't move.\n\nLex barely nods and grabs Timmy's hand.\n\nThe Tyrannosaur places his head next to the car.  He begins to shove the\ncruiser with his head.  The cruiser ROCKS.  The back window bursts,\nshards go flying.\n\nInside, the kids are THROWN back and forth, SHOVED against each other,\nand finally FLUNG against the top of the car as the cruiser FLIPS.\n\nThe whole world TILTS CRAZILY - trunks of palm trees slide by, the\nground above, the blazing eye of the rex, the tops of palm trees.\n\nThe cruiser SLAMS DOWN on its side, the windows splat in the mud.  Lex\nfalls he\nlplessly against the side window and lies motionless.  Timmy\nfalls beside her, banging his head.  He reaches for Lex.\n\n                            TIMMY\n              (softly)\n          Lex?  Lex?\n\nSILENCE.  No movement from Lex.\n\nTHE ANIMAL toys with the cruiser.  Like a dog with its bone, the\ndinosaur pushes the cruiser along with his head.  He pushes it past the\npicnic tables toward the ripped fence and the embankment.  Each shove\nsends the children flying again.\n\nThe cruiser is pushes closer and closer to the unprotected embankment.\nThe cruiser slams to a stop completely upside-down.  The T-Rex steps\nright on the cruiser, crushing the roof against the ground.\n\nINSIDE - the children crawl for their lives as the car crushes further\ndown from above and a tidal wave of mud oozes in from the sides.\n\nTHE REX - gnaws at the car, grabs a tire with his teeth,  It ruptures\nwith a pitiful pop.  The Rex grabs at the axle with his teeth, begins to\ndrag the car back.  THe kids, half-outside, are pulled with the car.\n\n\n\nGRANT DANCES -\n\nwith a flare!  The Rex is distracted.\n\nCLOSE ON - the Rex as he ROARS.  The flare gleams in his eyes.\n\nThe Rex starts toward Grant.  He tosses the flare over the half-standing\npart of the fence.  The Rex lunges after the flare.\n\nGENNARO has reached his limit.  Terrorized, he leaps out and SCREAMS:\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Extinct animals should stay extinct!\n\nHe bolts.  The Rex sees him and starts after him, THUNDERING by Grant,\nwho stays frozen in place.\n\nGennaro sprints for his life.  He's not even a distant match for the T-\nRex jogging behind him.\n\nGennaro dives into the LADIES ROOM.\n\nINSIDE - he slams the door and shoves the trashcan against the door.\nPOUNDING FOOTSTEPS APPROACH!  Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.\nLOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'\nposition.\n\nON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad\ndoor.  Pieces go flying.\n\nGennaro hides amidst the wreckage as the Rex sniffs around.\n\n\nGRANT RUNS BA\nCK -\n\nto check on the kids.  He reaches a hand underneath the flipped car,\nsitting in the mud.  Lex's soft voice can be heard.\n\n                            LEX (OFF)\n          Dr. Grant!\n\nGrant fishes under, finds Lex's hand, drags her out.  He quickly checks\nher for broken bones.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Lex, are you okay?\n\n                            LEX\n          Timmy's unconscious, he won't move.\n\nLex SCREAMS.  Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.\nThe animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!\n\nThe Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.\nHe SCREAMS.\n\nLex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.\n\n                            LEX\n          Timmy!\n\nThe Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens\nits huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.\n\nINSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of\nblood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the\n crushed roof and\nthe bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.\n\nThe Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up\nbut they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.\nBut if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.\n\nGrant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and\ndigs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed\nfence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!\n\nGrant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of\nthe embankment.\n\nJust in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser\nTEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway\nout of the car, unable to get out further.\n\nGrant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the\nembankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex\nlooks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.\n\nGrant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall\nand\n swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -\n\n- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -\n\n- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy\nand the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!\n\nGrant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex\nSCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as\nthe cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree\nat the base of the wall.\n\nGrant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.\nGrant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Let ... go ... please.\n\nThe Rex ROARS above.  They look up.\n\nTHE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING\nFLASHES.\n\n\nEXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -\n\nNedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.\n\nNEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link\nfence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur\ns across the road.\n\nNedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring\nthe careening jeep under control.\n\nThe jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and\ndives into a raging gully.\n\nNedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The\njeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he\ncranes his head around, examining his situation.\n\nNEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment\ngraveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around\ncan be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.\n\nNedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.\nand wades over to an abandoned tractor.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.\n\nHe loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and\nlooks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the\nstrange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli\nghts.\n\nHOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.\n\nNedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,\nlooks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.\n\nLooking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in\nthe eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry\nwarily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          I hope this is one of them herbivores.\n\nNedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter\ndrops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!\n\nNedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side\n- HOOT!\n\nNedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and\nrolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down\nthe embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to\nsteady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,\nswings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a\n demonic\napparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare\nof the headlights!\n\nCLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out\nlike an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.\n\nA big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          Gross.\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares\nout, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.\n\nThis glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.\n\nVERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.\nThey fire!\n\nThis glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.\n\n                            NEDRY\n          I'm blind, I'm blind.\n\nHe falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to\nthe embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the\nwater.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the\ndriver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.\n\nNedry pulls open the jeep door, \nthrusts his head in, slams it against\nthe door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The\nSpitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it\ncloses it on Nedry.\n\nNedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently\nturns his blind eyes that way.\n\nA long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND\nWIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.\n\n\nINT  TIMMY'S CRUISER\n\nTimmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the\ndoor handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and\ntries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him\n\nTimmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A\nCREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a\nfurther effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet\non the window frame and looks out the broken roof.\n\nTIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An\no\npen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!\n\n\nINT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION\n\nTim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a\ntree on the hillside.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Oh shit!\n\nTimmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He\ngrabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.\n\nCRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the\nwindow frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.\n\nCRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!\n\nTimmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up\nthe tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Timmy.  Are you ok?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Thank God you're here.  Where's Lex?\n\n                            GRANT\n          Below.  She's fine.  Let's get you down.\n\nTimmy nods.\n\nGrant peers throug\nh the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's\npredicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is\nsupported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Try the door you're leaning against.\n          Nice and slow.\n\nTimmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches\nbetween his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The\ncruiser drops another foot.\n\nGrant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser\nagain.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.\n\nGrant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door\nhandle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant\ngingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Crawl this way.  Slowly.\n\nCarefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.\nHe pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come\nto rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si\nts on a\nbranch, a few feet below the cruiser.\n\nCRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his\nfooting on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser\nhangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.\n\n                            GRANT\n          We're going to have to make a jump for\n          it, Timmy.  Okay?\n\nTimmy agrees.\n\n                            GRANT\n          One, two, three, jump.\n\nTimmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's\nhurtling right at them.\n\nTimmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP\nagainst his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES\nthem.  They scramble down as quick as they can.\n\nTimmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!\nGrant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he\nflips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a\nhalf-step behind them.\n\nTimmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth \nwith a THUD!  Grant\nCRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser\nkeeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.\n\nGRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally\nstops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked\nheadlight glaring.\n\nOil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.\nThe two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.\n\nGrant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy\nslowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Thanks, Dr. Grant.\n\n                            GRANT\n          You owe me one.\n\nGrant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Where'd Lex go?\n\nThey hear a faint WHIMPERING.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          There's Lex.\n\nHe runs.  Grant follows.\n\n\nINT  DRAINPIPE -\n\nLex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her\nmouth and\n she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head\nagainst the back of the pipe.  She WHIMPERS.\n\nON THE HILLSIDE -\n\nGrant and Timmy arrive at the drainpipe and stare in at Lex.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Come on out now, Lex.\n\nLex continues to band her head.  Timmy tries again.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          It's your turn to wear the goggles, Lex.\n\nShe shakes her head.  He holds up her baseball but she doesn't look.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          I found your baseball.\n\n                            LEX\n          You did?\n\nBut she doesn't move.  Grant speaks encouragingly.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Cone on, Lex, it must be cold in there.\n          And tight.  Why don't you come out?\n\n                            LEX\n          I'm afraid of the \"animals\".\n\n                            TIMMY\n          The \"animals\" are gone.\n\n                            LEX\n          Where did it go?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          I don't kno\nw but it's not here now.\n\n                            LEX\n          Are there any grownups out there?\n\n                            GRANT\n          I'm a grownup, Lex.  Come on out.  Gimmie\n          you hand, come on, here you go.\n\n                            LEX\n          I'm hungry.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Me, too.  We've got to get ourselves back\n          to civilization.\n\n\nEXT  ROADSIDE\n\nRegis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks\naround carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.\n\nHe touches his cheek.\n\nCLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,\nhe swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with\nblood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his\narm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and\npulls out another.  He SCREAMS.\n\nAs soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks\naround frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward \nhim.\n\n                            REGIS\n          Noooooo!\n\n\nBACK ON HILLSIDE -\n\nGrant and the kids crest the hill.  Grant puts on the night goggles and\nadjusts the dial and looks toward Regis.  The kids can't see that far.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          What's going on?\n\nGrant's green POV - Regis and the Rex bounding after him.  Regis hugs a\ntree, unmoving.\n\nGrant whispers to the kids.\n\n                            GRANT\n          It's Regis and the Rex is after him.  But\n          it's okay.  Regis knows the Rex can't see\n          him.  Evidently, he can only see move-\n          ment.  Regis'll be ok if he stays still.\n\nAFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the\nshadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.\n\nGRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis\nto the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him\nright back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.\n\n                            REGIS\n    \n      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.  Go\n          away.  Ed's your friend.  Back off!\n\nTHE REX watches him dance around.  It goes toward him.  This time its\njaws are open.  Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.\n\nGrant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a\nMETALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Let's go!\n\nGrant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.\n\n\nBACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -\n\nDrops of water splat on a big fern.  Light swims in the little puddle.\nIn the sky above, clouds hurry by, intermittently revealing a half-\nobscured moon.\n\nThe torn fence lies in a crumpled, twisted mess.  The wheel of a Land\nCruiser spins.  A little lizard runs in place on it.\n\nThe SOUND of the jeep's engine.  It's Muldoon and Ellie.\n\nTHEIR POV - a single cruiser lies on its side in the middle of the road.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Oh, My God!  Where's the other one?\n\nBefore the cruiser stops, she j\numps out.   Muldoon shouts a whisper.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Ellie!\n\nEllie turns in the headlight beams.  Muldoon tosses her a flashlight.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Wait up.\n\nMuldoon skids to a stop, leaps out of the car.  He catches up to Ellie.\n\nThey share a frightened, apprehensive look.  Muldoon gets on his knees\nand and touches a muddies area.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          T-Rex tracks.\n\nEllie looks out into the forest.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Then they must be out there.  They must\n          be out there.  I know it.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Perhaps.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          No!  They're out there.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          I've seen a lot of animal attacks in the\n          bush.  It's not as gory and horrifying to\n          see as you'd think.  No pools of blood or\n          exposed bones.  There is usually little or\n          no evidence left behind.  And if\n victims\n          are small, a predator can kill by just\n          shaking the little thing to death, eating\n          it, and leave not so much as a button.\n\nA definite RUSTLING in the brush.\n\nEllie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and\npushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie\nswallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.\n\nTheir flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under\ntheir feet.\n\nEllie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light\ninto the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.\n\nEllie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is\ncoming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.\nIt's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.\nMuldoon runs to her.\n\nGennaro is face-down.  Muldoon takes his pulse.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Thank God.  (beat)  We have to carry him.\n          First I have to ...\n\nHe stands and removes his \njacket.\n\nCLOSE ON - Muldoon tears the jacket into long strips.\n\nHe wraps Gennaro's wounds.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          He's losing a lot of blood.  Help me.\n\nMuldoon and Ellie carry Gennaro to the jeep.  They lay him on the back\nseat.  Muldoon jumps in back with him.  He keeps wrapping the wounds.\nEllie starts the engine, looks back at him.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Looks like you've been through this\n          before.\n\nMuldoon looks up.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          I told you I've seen big game attacks in\n          Africa.\n\nShe starts the engine.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Right.\n\nEllie skids out of there.\n\n\nINT  CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe dark room is lit with two outdoor torches.  Light flickering on\ntheir faces, Arnold and Wu stare at the console screen.\n\n                            WU\n          Why?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Because Nedry messed with the code.\n          That's why I'm checking it.\n\n              \n              WU\n          But that could take weeks.  What would be\n          faster?  Try keychecks.\n\nArnold snaps his fingers, grabs Wu,\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          That's true.  Keychecks will give me a\n          record of every button Nedry pushed.\n\nWith a rapid series of keys, Arnold initiates \"keystrokes\".  The\ncomputer displays a short series of commands.  Arnold runs his finger\ndown the screen.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Jesus, that's all he did all afternoon?\n          He was just dicking around, maybe waiting\n          to get his nerve up.\n\nWu points to a line.  It reads:  WHTE-RBT.OBJ\n\n                            WU\n          What's that?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Some sort of object.  Let's see if we can\n          trace it.\n\nArnold types FIND WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  Nothing.  He tries DEFINE WHTE-RBT.OBJ.\nStill nothing.  LIST WHTE-RBT.OBJ.  The screen fills with data.  Each\nline defines another security system that has been shut off:  SECURITY\nPERIM\nETER FENCES OFF/   SECURITY - INTERIOR FENCES OFF/  SECURITY -\nLABORATORY DOORS OFF/, etc.\n\n                            WU\n          What's it mean?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          It wasn't a bug.  It was a trap door that\n          fat bastard left for himself.  When he\n          hit WHTE-RBT. OBJ, it initiates a set of\n          commands that turned the whole goddamn\n          park off.  Hammond was right about him.\n\n                            WU\n          If I did that I'd leave a way to turn it\n          back on.  In case I had to.  I'm sure\n          Nedry did.  You're find it.\n\nArnold nods grimly.\n\n\nINT  CAFETERIA - NIGHT\n\nHammond sits quietly in the deserted cafeteria, calmly spooning ice\ncream into his mouth.  This room is lit by dozens of candles.\n\nMuldoon walks in, stares at Hammond in the semi-darkness.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          We found Gennaro.  He'd badly injured.\n          Harding's tending to him in your\n          quarters.  He'll be all right if we can\n    \n      radio for help.  Your grandchildren and\n          Grant are somewhere in the park.

After all, I keep\n          telling everyone, this park is made for\n          children.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Just so you understand that they're\n          missing, sir.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Missing?  Of course I know they're\n          missing.  You just said that.  Look, Bob,\n          let's not get carried away.  We've had a\n          little breakdown from the storm or\n          whatever, and as a result we've had a\n          regrettable, unfortunate accident.  And\n          that's all that happened.  We're dealing\n          with it.  Arnold will get the computers\n          cleaned up, and\n the radio and phone lines\n          open.  You'll find those kids and my good\n          friend, Dr. Grant.  I'm sure they'll want\n          some of this ice cream.  It's very good.\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - NIGHT\n\nDark.  Ellie helps Harding get Gennaro comfortable on Hammond's couch.\nBlood from Gennaro's injuries stain the rich leather.

Timmy\nfollows.  Grant follows, squinting.  Finally, he sees.  A big smile.\n\nThe kids look up at a twelve foot high electric fence.

Slowly, they proceed\nup and over.\n\nOn the other side, Grant looks around.  More high trees.  Beyond a field.\n\n                            GRANT\n          A herbivore grazing area.

He looks aro\nund, surveying\nthe misty forest.

Back to kids.\n\nTimmy and Lex are already snoring.  Lex turns and hugs Grant close to\nher.  She murmurs in her sleep.  Grant starts to pat her shoulder when\nTimmy, without waking, reaches to her and strokes her hair.\n\n                            TIMMY\n              (mumbles)\n          It's ok, Lex.

Really\n          interesting.  There are indications of a\n          similar virus in every tissue sample.\n          But it's not in the ground.  Could I look\n          at some of the discarded embryos?\n\nWu reluctantly agrees.  He opens a cabinet and brings her samples.\n\n                            WU\n          I'm sure you'll find your virus ... or a\n          similar one.  All animals carry many\n          viruses \nin a dormant condition.  It's\n          almost impossible to say with certainty\n          which are the same strains.\n\nEllie begins a test on a sample.  She adds a reagent and marks up a\nslide.  As she works:\n\n                            ELLIE\n          And yet from what Harding tells me, many\n          of you animals have similar symptoms -\n          besides the microvesicles, a lack of\n          hunger, loss of reproductive urges, sores\n          in the mouth and gums.\n\nWu waves his arms.\n\n                            WU\n          What the hell does Harding know?  He's a\n          veterinarian, not a pathologist.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nArnold pushes his chair away from his console and claps his hands as\nMuldoon walks in.  Muldoon asks hopefully.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          What is it?\n\nArnold points to the screen.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          That's it.\n\nMuldoon comes closer.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          That's what?\n\n                            ARNOL\nD\n          I found the command to restore the\n          original code.

And it does something else. It\n          erases the code lines that refer to it.  It\n          destroys all evidence it was ever there.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Nedry could steal the eggs, get back and\n          reset the whole show.

Arnold and\nMuldoon look out the window as lights come on through out the park.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Hot damn!\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Are the fences back on?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          You bet they are.  It will take a few\n          seconds to get up to full power, because\n          we've got fift\ny miles of fence out there,\n          and the generator has to feed the\n          capacitors along the way.  But in a half\n          a minute we'll be back in business.\n\nArnold points to the transparent map of the park.

It will be a few minutes\n          while the computer counts.  Then I'll\n          tell you where Grant and the kids are and\n          you can go and get them.  But every-\n          thing's working.  Half past ten and we've\n          got the whole thing back up and running.\n\nMuldoon picks up a phone, shakes his head.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Just hiss.\n\n\nBACK ON  GRANT AND KIDS IN TREE -\n\nGrant snores.  A mosquito buzzes around him.  He waves him away and\ncontinues to sleep.\n\nIn the distance, a tiny BEEPING. Below the towering tree, across the\nf\nield, a sensor beeps, it's green light blinks, and the beeping stops.\n\nIN THE HIGH TREE, the branches sway.  Grant and the kids sleep on.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nThe glowing, glass map.  Arnold and Muldoon stare at it.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          What is taking so damn long?  Where are they?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          There's a lot of extraneous movement out\n          there.  Branches blowing, birds, back-\n          ground movement.  It may take, ah, okay,\n          count's finished.\n\nMuldoon looks at Arnold anxiously.  Arnold looks down.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Hmmmm.  I don't see them.  Maybe they're\n          out of range of a sensor.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Shit.  I don't know where they are.  I\n          wish I could go out there   But I haven't\n          got anything to use on the Rex.  My\n          rocket launcher's in the jeep Nedry\n          stole.  And going out with a big gun in\n          the dark would be suicide\n.\n\n\nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - NIGHT\n\nBrightly lit again.  Ellie performs tests with a centrifuge.

He climbs off his stool.\n\n                            WU\n          No point in everyone being exhausted.\n\nHe starts to leave.  He comes back and speaks consolingly at Ellie.\n\n                            WU\n          I'm sure Muldoon will find Dr. Grant as\n          soon as there is light.\n\nEllie appreciates his effort, nods seriously, goes back to work.\n\n                                                      DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT  OCEAN - JUST BEFORE DAWN\n\nBeautiful dark ocean.

A\nlarge shadow falls on their quiet faces.  Lex opens an eye. She SCREAMS.\n\nGrant and Timmy wake up with a start.\n\nTHEIR POV - AS THE CAMERA LOOKS THROUGH THEIR LEGS AND TILTS UP right\ninto the huge face of A DUCK-BILLED HADROSAUR, a gigantic dinosaur with\ncow eyes.  Its head moves up through the canopy of the trees.  Then the\nhead swoops way down below.  And returns to Grant's level and stares at\nhis shoe.\n\nThe hadrosaur tastes Grant's shoe.  The kids\n press tightly into Grant.\n\n                            LEX\n          He gonna eat us?\n\n                            GRANT\n          I don't think so.

He picks a big fruit off the tree and tosses it into the\nhadrosaur's mouth.  CHOMP.  He feeds it again.  Lex and Timmy toss a few.\n\nCHOMP!  CHOMP!  HONK!  HONK!\n\nThe hadrosaur's big head swoops way down, momentarily gone.\n\nWhen she returns, all three quickly gather fruits and throw them into\nher mouth.  The hadrosaur pulls back with her giant mouthful of fruit.\nShe pulls further and further back and then her huge head turns and\nmoves down.\n\nGrant, Lex and Timmy strain to see through the branches.\n\nTHEIR POV - The hadrosaur is feeding four scampering, baby hadrosaurs.\nLetting the fruit tumble from her mouth into theirs.  Lex YELLS:\n\n                            LEX\n          Come here, babies!  Get your b\nreakfast!\n\nThe babies run to the base of the tree.  The kids toss fruits right down\nto them.  Lex and Timmy climb lower to feed them right from their hands.\n\nGrant and the mother hadrosaur stare at each other.  She sniffs his\nfoot.  He moves closer, straddling a branch.  He lifts up her lip and\nexamines her gums.\n\nCLOSE ON - a ripped piece of fence stuck in her teeth.\n\nGrant yanks it out.  He lets it drop to the ground.  He take a large\nleaf and rubs her teeth with it.\n\nCLOSE ON - her mouth as Grant's hand touches the side of her tongue.  He\nsees little tiny bumps.\n\nThe hadrosaur lets out a low groan.   Grant is puzzled, rubs harder.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Like the trike.  Maybe it's not the stones.\n\nHONK!   She pulls her mouth away.

She smiles.\n\nLEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.\n\nLex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the\nbrush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.\n\nBACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:\n\n                            TIM\n          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.\n\nGrant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.\n\nHIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in\nthe shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.\n\n                            LEX\n          Whoa!\n\nWith a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.\n\nLex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the\ntall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log\nb\nridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.\nLex in is paradise.\n\nBehind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the\ntriceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:\n\n                            LEX\n          Giddyup!\n\nThe trike takes off, in a rush.

He comes up\nsheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.\n\nThe baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as\nshe goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.\n\nTimmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.\nThe baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.\n\n                 \n           GRANT\n          Go home now.  Home to Freda!\n\n                            LEX\n          Oh, let him stay.

Lex is\nheartbroken.\n\n                            LEX\n          Will I ever play with him again?\n\nGrant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.\nHe has to keep them going.   He points across the field.\n\n                            GRANT\n          We gotta get to that motion detector.\n          It's still a ways.\n\nLex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd\neating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They\ndrink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the\nstill water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the\nwater's \nedge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back\nwhile the adults watch indulgently.\n\n\nEXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING\n\nMuldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail\noff in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to\ntrack the different groups.\n\nA BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a\nsmall group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.\n\nA BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he\nscatters them.\n\nMuldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was\nlost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger\nside still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.\nWhen he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The\nimage is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          I found Nedry!\n\nIn the distance, the call is ECHOED.\n\n                            BEARDED WORKE\nR (OFF)\n          I found him!\n\n                            BALD WORKER (OFF)\n          Found him!\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\nHammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on\nthe couch.  Gennaro's eyes flutter and Hammond enters and smiles.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          He, Donald.  Glad you're awake.  I hope\n          you're not going to take this little\n          mishap you had and hold it against my\n          park.  It would be terrible if the\n          finishing funds were in any way held up.\n\nGennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He\nwants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro\nenthusiastically agrees with a nod.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          You really shouldn't have gotten out of\n          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite\n          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged\n          some equipment.  Arnold, Muldoon, and Wu,\n          all loyal employees, are righting damage\n    \n      as we speak.\n\n                            GENNARO\n          Oh good, 'cause I love the park!  It's\n          more than we ever dreamed!  Those\n          brachiosaurs are so big!  And those\n          Spitters -\n              (he spits)\n          - incredible!  I only have one problem.\n          Aren't we going to have pterodactyls?\n              (he frowns, smacks his forehead)\n          Oh, they'd fly away!\n\nGennaro looks off, watching the imaginary pterodactyls fly away.\nHammond takes out a bag.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Take a look at these, Donald.  Have you\n          seen these?  These are great.\n\nHammond dumps things out of the bag.  They are souvenirs of the park.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Wind-up toys.  Spitter umbrellas.\n\nGennaro is thrilled.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I got some great t-shirts.  Dinosaur\n          bingo, hey ...\n\nHammond leans closer.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Wu says he can make a foot high\n    \n      triceratops.  We'll sell pets as living\n          souvenirs.  Bio-engineered to eat only\n          food we sell, of course.\n\nGennaro can't take it.  Great idea!  He high-fives Hammond repeatedly.\n\nHarding enters and gently taps Hammond on the shoulder.\n\n                            HARDING\n          You'll have to bear with him, Mr. Hammond.\n          He's doped to infinity and back.\n\n\nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY - DAY\n\nSunlight pours through the windows.  Ellie sits with her head in hands.\nShe looks around and wanders the lab.  Notices a drawer, slides it open.\n\nX-rays.  She shuffles through, finds some marked: FREDA.\n\nEllie snaps on a viewing light at her lab station.  She studies the X-\nray.  She looks up in surprise.   Studies it again.\n\nThe viewing light is snapped off.  Ellie looks again.  Wu stands there.\n\n                            WU\n          Who gave you permission -\n\nEllie attacks back.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          I'm here to investigate this park. And\n          there's\n plenty you haven't told me.\n\n                            WU\n          That's absurd.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          These bones aren't fully formed.\n\n                            WU\n          You're qualified to interpret x-rays of\n          living dinosaurs?  I doubt it.  It took\n          me many months to learn.\n\n                            Y\n          I'll tell you something else, Freda isn't\n          an adult, just a huge juvenile.\n\n                            WU\n          You're making a lot of assumptions here.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Right.  What the hell is going on, Wu?\n\nThey stare at each other in the bright sunlight.\n\n                            HAMMOND (OFF)\n          Growth hormones.\n\nThe two swing around.  Hammond stands in the sharp shadows of the room.\n\n                            WU\n          She didn't have a right to explore my lab.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Let's not argue, Wu, we have a serious\n          problem.\n              (to \nEllie)\n          These animals don't last.  There is a\n          regularity, a predictability about when\n          they die.  It's always ... very young.\n          We don't know why.  Given time, I'm sure\n          Wu will figure it out.  It's just ...\n\n                            WU\n          Just some adjustment in the code is\n          required.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          But there are deadlines.  The park opens\n          next summer. And it requires full-grown\n          specimens.  So Wu uses growth hormones to\n          achieve the desired size in a short\n          amount of time.  But they all keep dying\n          and we don't know how to stop it.\n\nEllie and Wu stare at Hammond.  He steps forward.  The light is so hot\nbehind him that his appearance is like an apparition.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I was going to tell you all this myself,\n          Dr. Sattler, after Gennaro stopped\n          breathing down my neck.  That's why I\n          wanted you and Dr. Grant \nhere on my\n          island - you have to help me keep the\n          dinosaurs alive.  Won't you please help\n          me?\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nIN THE SKY, the sun momentarily burns through the clouds -\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY\n\n\nEllie enters.  On the couch, Gennaro snores lightly.  In a chair nearby\nHarding sleeps, a roll of gauze grasped in his hands.\n\nEllie walks over to the large model of the park that Hammond revealed.\nShe looks at the miniature dinosaurs that sit in different sectors of\nthe park.  She picks up the plastic Rex, examines it, drops it back in.\n\nShe brushes by Harding and studies Gennaro's pasty, sleeping face.  Air\nblows in and out of his dry lips.  She examines the gauze wrapped around\nhis wounded leg.  It seeps with blood.\n\n\nINT CONTROL - DAY\n\nArnold works at his console.  Hammond and Wu lean over his shoulder.\nEllie bursts in, very agitated.  Hammond looks up.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Gennaro's losing a lot of blood. \n He\n          needs transfusions.  We gotta get a\n          rescue helicopter.  Arnold, what's with\n          the phones?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Ah hell. I just can't find it.\n\nHe sips his coffee and stares bleary-eyed at the screen.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Find what?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Nedry jammed all the communication lines.\n          He inserted some command, a lockout into\n          the program code.  I can't find it,\n          because I gave that restore command and\n          it erased part of the program listings.\n\n                            WU\n          So?  Just reset - shut the system down\n          and you'll clear the memory.  Everything\n          will be in the normal wakeup mode.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Shut the system down?\n\n                            WU\n          And reset.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          I've never done that before.  And I'm\n          reluctant to do it.  Maybe it's tr\nue, all\n          systems will come on, but maybe they won't.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Look, there is a sick man here who needs\n          medical attention or he'll die.  Four\n          people are out there, missing in your\n          park.  We need search teams.  We have to\n          have a phone or radio.\n\nArnold still hesitates.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Well?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Well, it's just that the safety systems\n          don't function with the computer shut\n          down and -\n\nEllie boils over.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          - turn the goddamn safety systems off!\n          Can't you get it through your head that\n          we have no choice?\n\nArnold looks at Hammond, who now stares out into the park.  Without\nturning, Hammond nods his consent.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Okay.\n\nArnold gets up and goes to the main panel.  He opens the doors and\nuncovers the metal swing-latches over the safety switches. \n He pops them\noff, one after another.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          You asked for it.  And you got it.\n\nHe throws the master switch.\n\nThe control room goes black.  All monitors go black.  Arnold, Wu and\nEllie stand in the dark.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          How long do we have to wait?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Thirty seconds.\n\n\nEXT  FIELD IN THE PARK -\n\nGrant and kids walk through a clearing.  Lex stops.\n\n                            GRANT\n          What is it?\n\n                            LEX\n          I hear something.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Come on.\n\nTimmy looks around. The morning is still and peaceful. Branches are\nmotionless.  Only a little bird jumps from one branch to another.\n\n                            LEX\n          Hear it now?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          You're hearing things.  Come on, we gotta\n          get back and warn them about the boat.\n\nLex hesitates but doesn't want to be left behind.  She runs betw\neen\nGrant and Timmy.  Then they all hear it.\n\nHONKING.  It comes from the herd of duck bills behind them.  First the\nhonking of a single animal, then another animal joins in, then another\nand another, until the whole herd has taken up the honking cry.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          What's going on?\n\n                            GRANT\n          They're agitated.\n\nThe duckbills twist and turn.  They hurry out of the water, circling the\nyoung ones to protect them.\n\nWith a ROAR, the T-Rex bursts from the trees, just a hundred yards away\nstraight toward the hadrosaurs.\n\n                            LEX\n          I told you I heard something!\n\nThe earth SHAKES.  A low rumble is heard and felt as the hadrosaurs begin\nto run  in a parallel direction to the course of Grant and the kids.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Outta the way, kids! Run!\n\nGrant grabs Lex, lifting her bodily off the ground, and carries her like\na football.  Timmy runs beside them.\n\nHadrosaurs run alongside of them.  Grant\n hears the crashing of trees.\nHe takes a glance over his shoulder.\n\nGRANT'S POV - a flurry of flamingos takes flight and spooks the herd\ninto changing direction.  The hadrosaurs swerve and charge right into\nthe path of Grant, Lex and Timmy.  They all SCREAM.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nThe quiet black room.  Hammond stands by the big window.  His pensive\npresence affects all in the room.\n\nArnold looks at his illuminated watch.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Memory should be cleared by now.\n\nHe pushes the main switch back on.  Nothing on.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Damn.\n\nArnold pushes the switch off and then on again.  Still nothing.  He\nglances at Hammond's back.  Sweat forms on his brow.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          What's wrong?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Oh hell!  I have to turn the safety switches\n          back on before I restart the power.\n\nArnold flips on three safeties, and covers them again with latch covers.\nHolding his breath, he\n turns on the main power switch.\n\nFirst, there is the computer beep.  Ellie jumps.  Then relaxes.  The\nlights come on.  The screens hum.  Hammond's shoulder twitches slightly.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Thank God!\n\nThe room is jubilant.  Hugs and cheers.  Ellie picks up a phone.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Arnold!  They're still not working.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          No, it sounds dead but after a reset, all\n          system modules have to be brought on line\n          manually.\n\nArnold quickly goes back to work at his console.  Hammond turns.\n\n                            WU\n              (to Hammond)\n          Arnold's about to get the phones up.\n\nArnold pushes the chair back.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Okay, we're up again!\n\nEllie grabs the phone back up.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          No we're not.  Phones still dead.\n\nArnold swings her way.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Can't be -\n\n                    \n        HAMMOND\n          My God, look at this, Arnold.\n\nHammond points to the transparent map.  A tight cluster of dots by the\nlagoon move in a coordinated way.  Moving fast, in a kind of swirl.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          What's happening?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n              (tonelessly)\n          The duckbills.\n\n                            WU\n          My good God.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          What?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          It's the Rex ...\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          They've stampeded ...\n\n\nBACK ON  THE HADROSAURS - LOW ANGLE ON THE STAMPEDE -\n\nGrant and kids run for their lives.  Behind them the duckbills charge\nwith surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,\nkicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.\n\nCLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.\n\nA horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and\nstruggling to stay out from underfoot.\n\nCLOSE ON\n - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.\n\nFrightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the\nmaelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.\n\nGRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind\nGrant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.\n\nAnother deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.\n\nGrant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.\nThe animals continue to close.\n\nCLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground\nVIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.\n\nGRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in\nbetween big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her\ndusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant\npushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.\n\nGRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another\nslams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.\n\nStampeding legs send clods of dirt fl\nying in the air.  Above, even the\nbirds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.\n\nGRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies\nwith giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.\n\nA boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his\nrocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.\nThey dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick\nroots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING\nthe rocky enclave they have just left.\n\nGrant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate\nabove them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.\nThey watch the herd trample on.\n\n\nCLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.\n\nLex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.\n\nThe T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.\n\nAs the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges\nfiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped \nin dust.\n\nGrant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet\nhorror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Let's go.  Now!\n\nThe herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.\n\nGrant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nHammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly\nclears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.\n\nNow the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed\n          one of my animals!  Where's Muldoon?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          I'm sorry, Mr. Hammond.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          My animals!  My animals!\n\nMuldoon enters, limping in.  Hammond is very upset.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Where have you been?  My Rex killed a\n          hadrosaur.  You should be out there,\n          doing something.\n\n                            MUL\nDOON\n          I just came to tell you - you're minus\n          one computer expert.\n\n\nEXT  BY THE RIVER, PARK - DAY\n\nThe water rushes a few hundred yards away.  Grant and the kids have\nfinally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.\n\n                            GRANT\n          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back\n          to the Visitor's center.\n\n                            LEX\n          Not me.  I'm not walking anymore.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Come on Lex, I'll carry you.\n\n                            LEX\n          Nope.  Too scared.\n\nTimmy looks up at Grant.  Grant kneels down by Lex.  Lex embraces Grant.\n\n                            GRANT\n          You ready?\n\nShe wipes her tears.\n\n                            LEX\n          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't\n          have to walk so close to the animals!\n\n                            GRANT\n          What raft?\n\nLex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is\ntwenty yards away.\n\n                            LEX\n\n          Where I found Freda's baby.\n\nGrant start to stand.  He's thinking.\n\n                            GRANT\n          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at\n          least ten miles to go.  If we take the\n          raft along the river, we can make much\n          faster progress.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Let's do it.\n\n\nINT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -\n\nGrant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes\npast drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of\ncyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,\nempty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Lex, I don't see any raft.\n\nTimmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Keep going.\n\nGrant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,\npiles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Bullseye!\n\nTimmy is reliev\ned.  Lex smiles.\n\n                            LEX\n          Told you!\n\nGrant grabs them.  Looks around, still -\n\n                            GRANT\n          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?\n\n                            LEX\n          Actually, I never really saw one. Just\n          assumed.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Assumed?\n\nShe nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.\n\nIN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of\nlight fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes\nthe handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall\non her, knocking her to the ground.\n\nLEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.\n\nGrant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling\nirrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!\n\nLex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.\n\n                            TIMM\nY\n          Look, Lex!  Look!\n\nShe looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with\nher.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I'm afraid there's no raft.\n\nGrant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -\nthe box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..\n\n\nAT THE RIVER'S EDGE -\n\nGrant pulls a cord.\n\nWith a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking\nand jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it\npops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.\n\nTimmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and\npushes off with his oars.\n\nThe small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out\ninto the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.\n\nGrant surveys the river.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Looks pretty calm.\n\nTHUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.\nShe reaches in\n about elbow deep.\n\nGrant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his\nmight.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud\nfloor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.\n\nA general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.\n\n\nA WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -\n\nGrant energetically works the oars.\n\nCLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.\n\n                            LEX\n          I'll row, Dr. Grant.\n\n                            GRANT\n          No.\n\nBut he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her\nhand in the water.  It still trails.\n\n                            LEX\n          Hey, we're still moving.\n\nGrant looks into the water.  She's right.\n\n                            GRANT\n          There's a current.\n\nGrant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two\nkids look at him.\n\n                            LEX\n          You can't sleep.\n\n                            GRANT\n              (eyes closed)\n          I'm not sl\neeping... yet.\n\n                            LEX\n          I'll do it!\n\nLex picks up the oars and begins.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          We gotta warn them about the boat.\n\nGrant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and\ntakes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.\n\n\nA BEND IN THE RIVER -\n\nCurrent picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Cool!\n\nWhite foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out\nlaughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.\n\n\nANOTHER BEND -\n\nNow the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is\nrocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes\na moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.\n\nThe raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's\nyanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his\ngrip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Thought\n is looked calm?\n\n                            GRANT\n          Guess I was wrong.\n\nGrant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.\n\nLex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and\nagain.  Her face is serious.\n\n                            LEX\n          I can't swim!\n\nGrant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.\nHe lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the\nrubber grips.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Hold on real tight.\n\nThey go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.\n\nThe raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.\n\nJagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the\nrocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging\ntrees.\n\nGrant looks ahead.  He blanches.\n\nHIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.\n\nThey're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,\nheaving over the magnificent precipice.\n\nTimmy tries to tighten L\nex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.\n\nThe raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.\n\nThe rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out\nof Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.\n\nAt the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.\nWith all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let\nhis hands smash into the overhanging branch.\n\nThey stop right at the waterfall's edge.\n\nGrant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps\nrushing.  His strength ebbs.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Don't let go!\n\nGrant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet\ntree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.\n\nThe rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.\nLex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.\n\n               \n             TIMMY\n          You can do it!\n\n                            GRANT\n          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....\n\nHis hands slipping, slipping ...\n\n                            GRANT\n          No!!!!!\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nCLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.\n\n\nINT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nArnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.\n          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.\n\nHammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Could he drown in that position?  That's\n          a very valuable animal.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          I know it's a valuable animal.\n\nMuldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue\nquietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.\n\n                            WU\n          What's that, John?\n\nWu points to the screen behind \nArnold's head.  In the upper right-hand\ncorner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          You running on auxiliary power?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          I'm not.\n\n                            WU\n          Looks like you are.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Can't be.\n\n                            WU\n          Print the system status log.\n\nArnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to\nlife.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.\n\nEllie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR\nFAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.\n\nHammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.\n\nThe room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.\nHammond ROARS above the chaos.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          What the hell is going on?\n\nOnscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.\nAt zero, the lights go off, the monitors,\n even the computer.  Just the\nalarms keep screaming.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!\n\nArnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward\nArnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!\n\nArnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's\nattack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.\nBreathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.\n\nArnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at\nHammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but\n          I'm going to put it all back together for\n          you - I promise.  I will\n\n\nBACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -\n\nGrant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from\ntoppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.\n\nThe ROAR of the\n water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging\ncurrent to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.\nNothing.\n\nGrant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,\nthe water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left\nin the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,\nvarious pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered\nby rushing white water.\n\n                            LEX\n          The waterfall stopped.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I think they cut the power.  Hey -\n\nHe points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall\nonce poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist\nis the visitor's center.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,\n          kids.\n\nThey grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.\n\n\nBACK ON CON\nTROL ROOM -\n\nMuldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is\nalternate patches of bright and dark.\n\nIn a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow\nwith a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.\n\nWu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological\nrendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they\nhave been running on auxiliary power.  Wu yells above the alarm:\n\n                            WU\n          You shut down as six thirty-four this\n          morning, and when you started back up, it\n          was with auxiliary power.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Jesus.  The auxiliary generator fires up\n          first and then that's used to start the\n          main generator because it needs a heavy\n          charge.  The main generator has to be\n          manually reset.\n\n                            WU\n          Outside?  In\n the generator building?\n\nArnold nods.  Muldoon points to a line in the printout:\n\n06:35:22   WARNING: FENCE STATUS (NB)  OPERATIVE - AUX POWER\n\n                            MULDOON\n          This doesn't mean the fences have been\n          off since six-thirty, does it?\n\nArnold grabs the paper, looks at it, slams it down.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Backup power doesn't generate enough\n          amperage to power the electrified fences,\n          so they were automatically kept off.\n          That's also why we had no phones or\n          radio.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          All of the fences?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          Yes.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Including the velociraptor mesh?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n              (disgusted, exhausted)\n          Yes, yes, yes.\n\nIn the corner, Hammond lifts his head and Ellie gently helps him to a\nsitting position.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Do you mean those raptor\ns could be loose?\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          I'm afraid so.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          No, no way.  Last time, it took 'em two\n          days to chew through that mesh.  But give\n          'em enough time, they'll get out.  We\n          better get that power on now.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Regardless, check the pit.  Make sure\n          there' five of them there.\n\n\nEXT  VISITOR'S CENTER - AFTERNOON\n\nMuldoon and Arnold run across the lawn.  Muldoon carries his rocket\nlauncher at a ready position.  In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,\nlights FLASH a continued warning.\n\nThey reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its\nfamiliar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they\napproach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.  Grey steam pours\nout of the vents of the building, obscuring everything.\n\n                            ARNOLD\n          What's that steam coming out of my\n          generator room?\n\n           \n                 MULDOON\n          Relax, it's just refrigerated air.\n          There's a leaky cooling pipe.  I fixed it\n          a couple times before but the original\n          installation was at too sharp an angle.\n\nArnold accepts this.  He is about to enter when Muldoon instructs him.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Just go and turn on your generator, then\n          get right back to the control room.\n\nArnold lights a cigarette and disappears into the steam-shrouded door.\n\n\nEXT  RAPTOR PIT - AFTERNOON\n\nMuldoon inspects an extremely discouraging sight.  The thick mesh that\ncovered the pit has been chewed through and ripped open.  With heavy gun\nin one hand, Muldoon shines his flashlight into the pit.  It's empty.\n\nMuldoon looks up.\n\nMULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.\n\nMuldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away\n\nMuldoon breaks into a run.\n\n\nINT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nMuldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin\ng full-tilt.  He\nkicks open the door.  Steam pours out.  Standing in the thick steam,\nMuldoon yells for Arnold.  No answer.  He steps in the doorway and\nshines his flashlight around.\n\nMULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes\nand small machinery can be seen in the steam.\n\nMuldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.\n\nAs soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,\nan animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and\nflashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of\ncigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.\n\n\nINT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON\n\nMuldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Raptors chewed their way out.

To assist in an emergency just\n          like this one.  Let's go.  Muldoon, round\n          up the workers.  They'll go with us too.\n\nMuldoon stares at Hammond, then drops it.  They prepare to go.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Wait.  What about Arnold?\n\n\nEXT  HILLSIDE, PARK -\n\nGrant and the kids come over the hill.  Timmy sees the big fence and the\nVisitor's Center close behind.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          We're home!\n\nLex and Grant happily run down the hill.\n\n\nEXT  ELECTRIFIED FENCE IN PARK - AFTERNOON\n\nGrant and the kids stand in the long shadows of the electric fence.\nThis huge fence is much higher than what Timmy has had to climb.  Grant\nturns to him apologetically.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Sorry, Tim.  We gotta climb up.\n\n                            TIM\n          That's all right, Dr. Grant.  You owe me\n   \n       one.\n\n\nEXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - AFTERNOON\n\nWu stands at the open sliding gate of the perimeter fence surrounding\nHammond's quarters..  Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,\nlauncher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,\nHammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every\n          moment.  But this shell carries quite a\n          punch, so if you're too close, it'll take\n          a piece of you.  Ellie's on the headset\n          with you.  If another ones come at you,\n          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start\n          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are\n          easily distracted.  They'll come running\n          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both\n          of you, get behind this fence as quick as\n          possible.\n\nWu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way\nacross the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands\nready at the open \ngate.\n\nWu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from\nthe door to the generator building.\n\nCLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.\n\nTHE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor\nleaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu\nstruggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.\n\nEllie comes running away from the safety of the gate.  She jumps up and\ndown, waving her hands, and SCREAMS:\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur, you can't\n          catch me.  Hey, come and get me, you\n          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!\n\nThe Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking\nhim loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon\nfires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!\nDirect hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.\n\nMuldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju\nred man to safety.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          You ok?\n\nIn reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.\n\n                            WU\n          Now, there's four.\n\nMuldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.  He waves for Ellie to come in\nand join them.\n\nEllie takes off toward the generator building.  She YELLS:\n\n                            ELLIE\n          I'm going in.  Muldoon, cover the door\n          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!\n\nMuldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may\nbe their best plan.\n\nEllie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and\ngraceful.  She ducks into the generator building.\n\nAbove it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.\n\n\nBACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE\n\nThe three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex\nabove the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to\nbegin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense\nface is a river of sweat.\n\n\nINT  GE\nNERATOR BUILDING -\n\nEllie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.\nHer face is lit by a flashing yellow light.  She bangs her head on a\npipe.  She rubs her head.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Damn, I banged my head.\n\n                            WU (OVER RADIO)\n          Oh that's good, that must be the water\n          pipe.  You're really close now, there's a\n          cabinet just above your head.  Reach up\n          and open it.  The handle turns to the\n          left.\n\nEllie turns the handle.  The cabinet opens.\n\n                            WU (OVER RADIO)\n          It's a large throw-switch.  Pull it down,\n          count to three, and push it back up.\n          That's all there is to it.\n\nEllie throws it down.  She counts:\n\n                            ELLIE\n          One -\n\n\nBACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -\n\nJust a few feet from the bottom of the fence.\n\n\nBACK ON ELLIE -\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Two -\n\n\nBACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -\n\nGrant and Timmy jump down. \n Lex is just behind.  Her sneaker catches in\nthe fence pattern.  She pulls on it.\n\n\nBACK ON ELLIE -\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Three!\n\nShe throws the large switch back.\n\n\nBACK ON LEX -\n\nShe jumps off the fence.  Her sneaker comes off, falls to the ground.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN ON LEX - it celebrates her narrow escape.\n\nGrant casually leans against the fence to help Lex with her shoe.\nNOTHING!  STILL NO ELECTRIC FENCES!\n\nThe Visitor's Center is in sight.  They all turn to each other.  Elated.\n\n                            LEX\n          We did it!\n\n                            TIM\n          We made it!\n\nLex jumps up and down.  Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.\n\n\nBACK ON ELLIE -\n\nThe siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie\nturns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.\nShe has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.\n\nIt's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.\n\nSMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down\n from\nabove the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.\n\nEllie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.\nThe raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.\n\nEllie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push\nagainst the wall, begins to climb up.\n\nThe raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie\nscrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.\n\nEllie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams\nher feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and\nbanging against pipes, she races toward the door.\n\n\nEXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION\n\nEllie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.\nWu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands\nwith his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.\nEllie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Raptor!\n\nThe raptor EXPLODES th\nrough the door of the generator building after\nEllie.\n\nMuldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.\n\nThe raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.\nHe slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.\n\nEllie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she\ngoes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.\n\nMuldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all\nhis might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a\nsecond, it doesn't move.\n\nEllie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad\nsecurity door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a\ncurse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.\n\nELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of\nthe gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.\n\n                            WU\n          Keep it open!  I'm coming!\n\nWu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.  Wu screams, runs spastically.\nWu and the raptor are neck-and-neck\n, equally close to the open door.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Come on, Wu!  Come on!  Run!\n\nThe raptor is inches from Wu.  Both are closer and closer to the door.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          They're coming inside!\n\n                            WU\n          Help!\n\nWu and the raptor are at the door.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          No they're not, Ellie.\n\nMuldoon slams the door shut on Wu and the raptor.  Wu's screams are\nhorrific.\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - CONTINUING ACTION\n\nEllie drops to her knees, her chest heaving, pulls her headset off with\na bleeding hand.  Muldoon, affected, turns to her.\n\n                            MULDOON\n          I couldn't compromise everyone's safety.\n\nEllie nods, catches her breath.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Why didn't the power go on?\n\n                            MULDOON\n          You just reset the power.  Now the\n          computer has to be booted.\n\nMuldoon looks out the tiny barred window of the security do\nor.\n\nMULDOON'S POV - There is already almost no sign of Wu.  The gate to the\nperimeter fence slides shut.  The raptor looks up.  He is trapped within\nthe perimeter fence of Hammond's quarters.\n\nCAMERA SLOWLY TILTS to the viewing window above.  Hammond stares down.\n\n\nINT  VISITOR'S CENTER -\n\nGrant and kids walk through the open security doors.  All is empty and\nquiet.  They call out but there are no answers.\n\n                            LEX\n          Where did everybody go?\n\nGrant thinks.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Probably your grandfather's quarters.\n          Let's go.\n\nA DISTANT BELLOW.  Grant reconsiders.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Actually, stay here.\n\nHe corrals the kids into the half completed enclosure of the Gift Shop.\n\n                            LEX\n          No, I want to stay with you.\n\nGrant looks around tensely.\n\n                            GRANT\n          No, keep an eye on things round here for\n          me.  I'll be back with the others.\n\n                 \n           TIMMY\n          What about -\n\nGrant looks at Timmy.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I'll radio the ship as soon as I find\n          somebody.  (beat)  You're in charge now.\n          Don't move from here ... unless you have\n          to, ok?\n\nTimmy nods.  Lex is happy, sinks to the floor.\n\n                            LEX\n          Goody!  I'm gonna rest.\n\nShe finds a box of wind-up dinosaur toys. She winds one. Sends it\nwalking to Timmy.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Tired!  He carried you the whole way.\n\nGrant slips off into the concealing shadows of the skeletal display of\nthe T-rex and raptor in combat.  He looks back above his own shoulder\ninto the menacing jaws of the skeletal raptor.  He shouts back.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Be right back.\n\n\nINT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n\nIt's a madhouse in the crowded baronial quarters of Hammond.  Gennaro is\nsinging at the top of his-lungs while Harding tries to restrain him.\nScared Workers huddle together, many a\nre injured.  Hammond sits on the\nfloor, in a meditative trance.\n\nEllie and Muldoon stare out the window.\n\nTHEIR POV - The raptor is jumping in the air.  With every jump he comes\ncloser to leaping onto the roof of their small building.\n\nMuldoon regards his rocket launcher ruefully.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Why don't you just nail that bastard?\n\n                            MULDOON\n          No more ammo.  I requisitioned six\n          charges but the bean-counter -\n              (he thrusts a finger at Hammond)\n          - cut it down to two.\n\nEllie looks up to the ceiling.  There is a large glass skylight with\ncrisscrossing iron bars casting an ominous shadow in the sun.\n\n\nEXT  THE ANNE B AT SEA - DAY\n\nThe ship continues along smooth sunlit sea.  Land is in distant sight.\n\n\nINT  STATEROOM -\n\nThe cracked egg is nudged open.  The cute scaly head of a six-inch baby\nraptor nuzzles its way out of the shell.  It shakes off a few pieces of\nclinging shell and immediately begins to devour one of the\n remaining eggs.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\nCLOSE ON - The wind-up dinosaur skitters across the polished floor.  It\nbands against the  the wall again and again.\n\nTimmy looks down at it and smiles at Lex.\n\n                            LEX\n          Any candy behind the counter?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Hungry?\n\n                            LEX\n          Starved.\n\nTimmy looks behind the counter.  He sees boxes of goods.  He moves a\nstack of umbrellas out of his way.  Lex gets up and pulls one out.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Nothing.\n\n                            LEX\n          Let's go to the kitchen.\n\nShe smiles and pops to her feet.  Timmy's not sure.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Dr. Grant said -\n\n                            LEX\n          - let's go.  We'll come right back.\n\nCLOSE ON - Timmy's torn face.  He's hungry, too.\n\nHe makes the right decision.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Nope.  We're waiting here t\nill Dr. Grant\n          gets back.  He'll help us get some -\n\nInterrupted by A SOUND.  A rhythmic, horrible BREATHING.   Now some\nlight and rapid STEPS.  And a SNIFFING.  It's definitely an animal.\n\nLex backs off in a hurry. She knocks the umbrella over.  It skirts\nacross the floor.  It spins and opens by itself.  Printed on it is the\nferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills\nspinning to a stop.\n\nThe breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a\ncorner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.\n\nIt's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it\nstudies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes\nflick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.\n\nTimmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off\nacross the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy\ngrabs another, whispers as he winds it.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Start winding now!\n\nLex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th\nem across the hall.  The raptor\nleaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges\nand darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.\n\nThe kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor\nCenter corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.\n\n                            LEX\n          Where are we going?\n\n                            TIM\n          The kitchen!\n\n\nINT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n\nWith a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's\nquarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the\nassembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.\n\nThe raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the\nskylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the\ncorners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          How long?\n\n                            MULDOON\n          Well, they seem to be getting faster all\n          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.\n\nEllie no\ntices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the\ngate.  She hammers on the glass.\n\nGrant's hand reaches for the knob.\n\nThe raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.\n\nEllie screams and screams.\n\nGrant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks\nup.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.\nGrant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the\nfence, grabs it, puts it on.\n\nEllie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          There's a raptor on the roof of this\n          building.  Open that gate and you're a\n          dead man.\n\nGrant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand\nto the glass.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Ellie, I'm go glad -\n\n                            ELLIE\n          Shut up and listen.  We have about\n          fifteen minutes here.  The computer has\n          to be rebooted.  That'll turn on the\n          electric fences.  Besides the r\naptor\n          stuck in here with us, there are four\n          more ...\n\nGrant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.\n\n\nINT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION\n\nThe kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a\nmaze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless\nsteel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids\ndart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,\ncrawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.\n\nRelentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids\ntheir obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their\nshortcuts, it just continues around.\n\nTimmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to\nhurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          We'll freeze to death in there.\n\n                            LEX\n          He's going to eat us!\n\nTimmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile \nof steaks.  He tosses one\ntoward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex\nout of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the\nother, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.\n\nThe raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He\ncontinues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.\n\nTim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and\nthrows her small weight alongside of Timmy's.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          PUSH!\n\nThe heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a\nstrangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of\nthe door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve\nbut they do not give.\n\nThe kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,\nTimmy is back on his feet.\n\n                            LEX\n          What is it, Timmy?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          I just remembered something.

He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup\ntoys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above\nand begins to run.\n\n\nINT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -\n\nThe kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -\n\n\nINT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -\n\nThe kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.\n\n\nINT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -\n\nAutomated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment\nto the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.\n\n\nINT  GENETICS ROOM -\n\nThe Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and\nmagnetic tape as the kids race by.\n\n\nINT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -\n\nThe kids slide int\no this room.  They race to its far corner, past\nincubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -\n\nKID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's\nbeen in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.\n\nCLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.\n\nHe begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.\n\nThe raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his\nyounger sister.\n\nCLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.\n\nAt the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the\nsituation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one\nof the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He\ncomes out with a syringe and a vial.\n\nThe raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The\nraptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.\n\nGrant speaks into the headset.\n\n                            GRANT (TO RADIO)\n          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.\n\nHe tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The\nraptor studies it, transfixed.\n\nGrant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor\nforgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it\nup, swallowing it whole.\n\nThe raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,\ntenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.\n\nThe kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset\nas the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Timmy, you know anything about computers?\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Well, I just got an XT at home.  I told\n          my Dad I wanted a 386.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Ok good, you're elected.\n\n\nINT  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nGrant and Tim and Lex study the quiet room.  Grant speaks calmly into\nhis headset.\n\n                            GRANT (TO RADIO)\n          Okay, we've reached the computer room.\n          Who can te\nll Timmy how to reboot?\n\n                            ELLIE (OVER RADIO)\n          Ah, Alan, nobody here knows how to boot\n          the computer.  Please hurry, we've only\n          got a couple minutes left.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Tim, you got to book the system.  They\n          reset the power and there are no phones.\n          We gotta turn on the fences and we gotta\n          stop that ship.\n\n                            LEX\n          Are they going to be ok?\n\n                            GRANT\n          If we can get help very soon.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          Sshh, you guys, I'm thinking.\n\nHe studies a grid on a large console.  He reaches out and touches a part\nof the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.\nPLEASE TRY AGAIN.\n\n\nBACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n\nThe raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.  Panic below.\nIn the middle of it all, Ellie is focused, listening on her headset.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nTimmy tries somethin\ng else.  BEEP.  Lex raises a hand.  Grant stops her.\n\n                            GRANT (TO RADIO)\n          Ellie, we're working as fast as we can\n          here.\n\nTimmy tries a screen section.  BEEP.  Again. BEEP.  Again.  BEEP.  BEEP.\n\nTimmy shakes his head.  In desperation he stabs at the keyboard below\nthe touch screen.  He punches the ESCAPE button.\n\nThe screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL\nSYSTEMS NORMAL.\n\n\nBACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n\nThe raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space\nas the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as\nthe current flows through him.  He can't get out.\n\nFinally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the\nspace he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.\n\nEllie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.\n\n\nBACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n\nGrant cheers and hugs Timmy.  Lex whoops.\n\n                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)\n          Ok, we're all right here for now.\n      \n    Thanks.\n\n                            GRANT (TO RADIO)\n          Don't mention it.  It was Timmy.\n\n                            ELLIE (ON RADIO)\n          But there's still one more raptor.  So be\n          careful.\n\nTimmy is pushing menus and submenus on the touchscreen now.\nCOMMUNICATIONS - RADIO - VEHICULAR ...  He gets the one he wants.\n\nHe indicates the radio-mike to Grant.\n\n                            TIM\n          I think this is the boat.  They called it\n          the Queen Anne or something.\n\nGrant grabs the mike.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Queen Anne, do you read me?  Queen Anne?\n\nThe radio crackles to life.\n\n                            RADIO\n          This is the Queen Anne B?  I copy.\n          What's up?\n\n                            GRANT\n          Report your position!\n\n                            RADIO\n          Ah, we're just about to dock here in\n          Puntaremas.  Who wants to know?  Please\n          identify yourself.\n\nTim punches the screen which displays FARRELL, F\nREDERICK D. (CAPT.)\nGrant reads it and nods.  His voice is tough as nails.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Try this for identification, Captain\n          Farrell.  You are in possession of stolen\n          biological materials.  If you don't turn\n          that boat around and return to Isla\n          Nublar immediately with your contraband\n          cargo, you will be found in violation of\n          Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act,\n          you will be subject to revocation of\n          license, penalties in excess of fifty\n          thousand dollars, and five years in jail.\n          Do you copy?\n\nSILENCE.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Do you copy, Captain Farrell?\n\n                            RADIO\n          I copy.  All ahead stern.\n\nA blinking light on a map indicates that the ship is pulling away from\nthe harbor.  Grant nods to Timmy who terminates the radio contact.\n\n                            TIMMY\n          What's the Uniform Maritime Code?\n\n                     \n       GRANT\n          Who the hell knows?\n\nGrant and Timmy start to celebrate again when Lex interrupts.\n\n                            LEX\n          What good does that do?  To have the ship\n          turn around?\n\nGrant turns to her seriously.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Well it gives us ten more hours.\n              (to Timmy)\n          Let's see if we can raise the Costa Rican\n          Coast Guard on that thing.\n\nThe last raptor smashes into the control room through Hammond's viewing\nwindow.  Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.\n\n\nINT ROTUNDA -\n\nWith the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and\nLex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant\ngoes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.\n\nThe raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the\ndisplay.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and\ntools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat\nbehind, and his snar\nling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.\n\nThe kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating\nrubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,\nclosing the gap on the kids.\n\nThe kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the\nskeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor\nis pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.\n\nGrant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,\nand slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive\nhead of the T-Rex drops free.\n\nIt falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.\n\n                            GRANT\n              (grimly)\n          And then there were none.\n\n\nEXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK\n\nMuldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.  Two workers carry\nGennaro on a stretcher.  Ellie boards with the kids on each side of her,\nholding her hands.\n\nGrant and Hammond walk together, toward the helicopter.\n\n              \n              HAMMOND\n          Dr. Grant, don't abandon this beautiful\n          place.  I need a man just like you to\n          help me get my park back on its feet\n          again.  And it will be on its feet again.\n\n                            GRANT\n          We have to leave now.\n\nHammond stops.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Oh you don't know.  There are wonderful\n          plans in the works, sites already\n          purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic\n          Japan.\n\nGrant is unimpressed.  He holds a hand out to Hammond.  Hammond tries a\nnew approach.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          Don't you see I've exalted human\n          potential here?  You must see it.  You\n          must feel it.  I called back a life form.\n          Listen, Dr. Grant, don't go.  Be a part\n          of this.  I'm inviting you to do just\n          that - let the others go, if they want.\n\n                            GRANT\n          You interrupted natural law.  There are\n          regulations,\n rules that nature follows\n          that make her knowable.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          You mean there are rules that nature\n          follows that create barriers to our\n          knowledge.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Barriers?  Like the seasons?  The earth\n          spinning, orbiting the sun?  The entire\n          solar system in interlocking motion.  Our\n          own beings in biological step with it\n          all.  Mr. Hammond, you've disrupted the\n          pattern and look what it's done!\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I know what it's done.  I've made\n          triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex.\n          I've got a batch of iguanadons being born\n          on Tuesday.  What do you say to that?\n\n                            GRANT\n          Don't count on it.  Now get in.\n\nGrant jumps in the copter, holds out a hand to Hammond.\n\n                            GRANT\n          You created mutant forms that you further\n          mutated to create amus\nement attractions.\n          You made biological puppets with\n          heartbeats and an early death sentence.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          I created genetic miracles!\n\n                            GRANT\n          You created a park to generate a profit-\n          making merchandising operation.\n\n                            HAMMOND\n          The merchandise is just a by-product.\n          Souvenirs for people to reflect on the\n          wonder.  You fainted when you saw the\n          brachiosaur.  Alan, look, let's not\n          argue.  The problem is that my employees\n          were not up to par with my dream.  They\n          failed me.  The park, I promise you, is\n          safe.  It really is.\n\nGrant grabs Hammond's arm, starts to tug.\n\n                            GRANT\n          You park is doomed.  Now come with me.\n          \n                            HAMMOND\n          It is not!  It's blooming!  In the throes\n          of labor!  You are one more more negative\n          voice in a \nuniverse of negativity.\n          You'll amount to nothing.  You'll be a\n          bone-brusher all your life.  I pity you.\n\nHammond pulls his arm away and strides away from the helicopter just as\nthe ROTORS START UP.  Hammond's suit whips in the wind.  Grant calls to\nhim, reaching out his arm.\n\n                            GRANT\n          Come back, Mr. Hammond!  It's over!\n\nHammond keeps walking.  He disappears over a grassy knoll.\n\nGrant's outstretched hand drops to his side when THE ATTACK comes.\n\nWith a huge bellow, the T-Rex comes charging at the helicopter.  THE\nPILOT screams for all to board as he starts to lift off.\n\nThe Rex bites onto the copter skid as the copter tries to escape.  The\ncopter angles dangerously as the Rex holds on.\n\nEllie fires a fire-extinguisher into the furious face of the Rex and its\njaws relax.  The copter escapes and starts to climb high into the sky.\nThe Rex paws after it, then drops down to four legs and gives the copter\na final swipe with its tail.\n\nThe tail SWISHES through \nthe air and CRACKS against the plexiglass\nwindshield which fissures and pops.  The pilot struggles to maintain\naltitude and manages to keep the craft in the air.\n\nWith a ROAR of its own, the copter breaks into the blue sky and soars.\naway, leaving an angry T-Rex alone.  Unnoticed by the frustrated Rex,\nHammond slips away and walks into the jungle.\n\n\nIN THE COPTER -\n\nSLOWLY PAN the exhausted faces of Muldoon and his workers, Lex and Timmy\nholding onto each other, and Grant huddles next to Ellie.  He reaches\nout and puts an arm around her shoulder.  She reaches up and pulls his\narm close.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          They're so beautiful.  They're condemned,\n          aren't they?  Even those embryo fragments\n          had the same viral contamination.\n\n                            GRANT\n          I have a theory.\n\nEllie looks up in surprise.  She give him a big smile.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          You have a theory?\n\nGrant smiles back at her.\n\n                            GRANT\n   \n       I think that they could never completely          \n          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was\n          always some microscopic mosquito\n          contamination.  But at the molecular\n          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur\n          received the same genetic massage, the\n          encoding that every mosquito gets to\n          terminate life after a season.\n\n                            ELLIE\n          So the very process itself was flawed.\n\nShe's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance\nto the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated\nby clouds.\n\nCAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.\nTHE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural\nbeauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.\n\n\nIN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR\n\nHammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He\nalmost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and\nrolls. He tumbles he\nlplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,\nfinally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face\ndown, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of\nlabored breath.\n\nCAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES\nINTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.\n\n                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\nEXT  OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nThe army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,\nslowly drifting across the moonlit water.\n\n                                                      FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJurassic Park\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0David Koepp\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:30.454590"}
