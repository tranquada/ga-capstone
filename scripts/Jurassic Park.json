STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the\ndifferent surfaces of the stones.\n\nCAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,\nabstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly\nRACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is\nfolded on its back.\n\n<b>SLOW MOTION\n</b> as the tip of a fine-pointed drill bores into the amber\ntoward the trapped bug.  Orange flecks fly.  The mosquito trembles.  The\ndrill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.\n\nA SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and\nextricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit\nglass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.\narriving under a long-lensed microscope.\n\nIN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately\nremoves a fragment of tissue.\n\nPINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.

Bill, I\n          don't want any tourists walking over my\n          raptor - I don't care if the Governor of\n          Montana is with them, just you guys.\n\nGrant and Ellie continue walking.

His slovenly looks are wildly out of\nplace on the rich leather sofa where he reclin\nes.\n\nAcross a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A\nsmooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy\nappearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.\n\nNedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          I'm not reneging.

One after the\nother, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one.

After\n          all, I know what you guys need so bad.\n          I've heard of reverse engineering.\n\nAs Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Let the other guy put in all the work,\n          all the R and D.

In\n          a few measly months you have know-how\n          that took researchers ten years to\n          determine.  You know how much Hammond has\n          invested of his own personal wealth?\n          Over five billion dollars!  And if you\n          guys get the jump on his - in no time,\n          the market's wide-open.\n\nNedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          But, boy, he's really got his product!\n          Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-\n          making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that\n          product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!\n\nNedry LAUGH\nS explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.\n\nBaker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.\n\nNedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs\ntoward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and\nsqueezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his\nhand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone\nand desperate Nedry.\n\n<b>                            BAKER\n</b>          Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is\n          not open to renegotiation.

Baker nods back\nand SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.\n\nNedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up\n, rubbing his belly.  As\nBaker leaves the room:\n\n<b>                            BAKER\n</b>          Make sure the eggs are on that supply\n          ship.

Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          This is not fun.\n\nGrant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant\nglowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't\n          land if it weren't safe.\n\nThe copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.\nGennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,\n          Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!\n\nAnother violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.\n\nCLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a \npacket of crackers.\n\nGennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.\nHe speaks a mantra.\n\n<b>                            GENNARO\n</b>          No problem.  Relax, relax.\n\nThe pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails\nsharply the other way.\n\n<b>                            GRANT AND ELLIE\n</b>          Whoa!!!!\n\nCLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.\n\nTHE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours\nacross the floor.\n\nNedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang\nsuspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.\n\nGrant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          I don't like this feeling ...\n\nThe pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.\nTrees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.\nEllie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.\n\nIN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose\nlow, fo\nr a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal\nbucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches\ndown on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.\n\nFor a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.\nGennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.\n\nGrant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.\nNedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Just think, Gennaro -\n              (laughs harder)\n          - you gotta agree it's funny!  These two,\n          they dig up dinosaurs!

As he smiles he motions with his\nhands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him.\n\n<b>      \n</b><b>                      PILOT\n</b>          Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a\n          storm alert.\n\nROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball\ncap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He\nshakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.\nHe throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla\n          Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.

Now, watch your step.\n\nEllie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.\n\n\n<b>EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING\n</b>\nGrant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the\nopposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:\nhuge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;\nrushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds\na\nnd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant\nand Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.\n\nThen, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon\ndirects A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back\nthe abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon\nover.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them.\n\n<b>                            ED REGIS\n</b>          This is Robert Muldoon, great African big\n          game hunter.  And he's working for us now.\n          Doing a bang-up job, too.\n\nMuldoon rests his rifle by a tree stump and shakes with Grant and Ellie.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Ed's a little more BS than PR.  Mr.\n          Gennaro, nice to have you back.\n\nGennaro nods warmly as Muldoon limps back to work.\n\nRegis leads on, taking Gennaro's arm and talking to him like and old\nfriend.  Nedry lumbers in the middle, alone.  At the rear, Grant and\nEllie study everything they see.  Grant\n calls to Regis but is ignored.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Mr. Regis, what is the nature of this park?\n\nEllie looks behind and sees cramped ferns spring out to capture the path\nthey just walked on.  She nudges Grant, who has seen the same.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          Aggressive growth, huh?\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Hammond's trademark.\n\nA distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and\nEllie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Out animals are greeting you!\n\nThey pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.\nGrant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          I hope this isn't one of those animatronic\n          exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Nope.\n\nGennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm\nthat leads to the \nVISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.\n\nEllie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.\n\nTHEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.\nThe needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.\n\nThis fence is only the prelude.\n\nSprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.\nWoven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical\nwire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN\n<b>THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!\n</b>\nCAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the\nhighest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.\n\nGrant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.\n\nThey reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade\ntrees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off\nthe walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper\ntruck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns.\n\n<b>                       \n</b><b>     REGIS\n</b>          I hope you brought your bathing suits!\n          Doesn't this mist and these plants really\n          create a bonafide prehistoric feeling?\n\nRegis points to a low building with glass pyramids on the roof.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          There's the Visitor's Center.\n\nA CRANE lowers an iron grating on top of one pyramid.  An animal TRUMPETS.\n\n\n<b>INT  VISITOR'S CENTER - DAY\n</b>\nCLOSE ON - the iron security grating as it fits over a glass skylight.\nAbove, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.\n\nGrant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,\nEllie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.\n\nThe Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed\ngirders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where\nthe back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,\nexhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL\nSPANISH WORKERS unpack masonry supplies.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b><b>     \n</b>     Where's Hammond?\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys.\n\nGrant strides over to an exhibit as Gennaro paces impatiently.\n\n<b>                            GENNARO\n</b>          Hot, hot, hot.  Ten billion bucks and the\n          air conditioning sucks.\n\nRegis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the\nfinished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.\n\nGrant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the\nWorld.  This is a large clock that presents millions of years as hours\nin a single day.  Many brightly colored hours are allocated to the\ndinosaurs.  Man receives the last second of the day.  Ellie joins Grant.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          The audicity of man to get here at the\n          last second and think he runs the show.\n\nGrant smiles at her inexhaustible enthusiasm.  He looks at a painted\nmural of a Raptor on one of the walls in the half-completed gift shop.\n\nNedry is at a coke machine, feeding in change\n.  It doesn't work.  He\nSLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.\nUpside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.\n\nTHE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a\ncatwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are\nlocked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies\nare scattered all around.\n\nRegis glances at his watch, looks up, and smiles.\n\nAt that moment, doors adjacent to the rotunda swing open automatically.\nA soothing female voice comes out of the public address system.\n\n<b>                            VOICE (ON P.A.)\n</b>          Please come to the theater.

He\nclimbs the stairs to the second floor.\n\n\n<b>INT  SCREENING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nSmall and plush.  Regis sits in the front, full of enthusiasm.  Grant and\nEllie sit further behind. \n Gennaro stands in the back and smokes.\n\nCELESTIAL MUSIC fills the room.  Mist covers and curls on the stage\nfloor.  Colored spotlights illuminate the mist in an eerie fashion.\noverall effect is the touristy Where's NY? high-gloss production.\n\nyears young, with a glint in his eye and very comfortable with his own\neffect.  He wears a white linen suit with a red rose in the breast\npocket.  Like an elder Carl Sagan, he addresses the group.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

There's your white cells,\n          exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily\n          wastes.  And there's a mighty nucleus,\n          the heart and brain of a cell.  This\n          nucleus has an amazing property.  It can\n          sp\nlit in half and reproduce itself.\n          That's how it grows.  And then those two\n          can do it again.  And again.

But think\n          of mutation - which is nothing more than\n          sloppy communication on the cellular\n          level.  Think how triumphant mutations\n          have been in natural selection.\n\n          Oh, but I know what you're saying.  It's\n          true that I have never been afraid to make\n          money with science.

The generator housed within is\nvery LOUD.  The wind increases, rippling clothes.\n\nSuddenly, the SOUND of a speeding jeep.  Grant turns.\n\nRacing across the rolling green landscape is A RED JEEP.  Muldoon is \nat\nthe steering wheel.  Two kids bounce happily around in the open jeep.\nThey are TIMMY, 9, and LEX, 6, brother and sister.  The jeep stops.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Grandpa!\n\nHammond looks up, delighted.  Arms open.

The carnivores are all\n          well-fed and kept separated from their\n\n          natural prey.

A deep trumpeting SOUND and\nTWO BRACHIOSAURS rumble away fr\nom the side of the road.  The ground\nSHAKES as they walk, their BELLOWING fills the air.  Led by Grant, the\npassengers rise through the open top of their Land Cruisers, to look up\nat the dinosaurs far above.\n\nDROOPING FROM ABOVE, leaves and little branches shower on Grant.

He stop suddenly and listens.\nApproaching FOOTSTEPS.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Oh, shit!\n\n\n<b>INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -\n</b>\nMuldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the\ndoor to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.\n\nBACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.\nWheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With\neverything he's got, he lifts the incub\nator waist-height.  And holds it.\n\nBACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer\nto the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket\ncatches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.\n\nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.\n\nBACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll\ndown his brow.\n\nMULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.\n\nNedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty\npalms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful\nboost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.\n\nCLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.\n\nNERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and\nthat.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the\nincubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.\n\nAt that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.\n\nNEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.  \nNedry's frightened face.\n\nMULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He\ntakes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.\n\nNEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,\nand zooms into the night.\n\nA moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust\nthat still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his\njeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his\nface straining to understand.\n\n\n<b>EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT\n</b>\nNedry's red jeep flies down the park road.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.\n\nHis tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a\nsmaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.\n\nNedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric\nfence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!\n\nTwo safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to\nthe first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,\nand another.  It f\nits.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.\n\nNedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the\nground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the\nmuddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.\n\nHe races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his\nface.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.\n\nHe grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.\n\nNedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.\nHe jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates\nmove recklessly in the stormy night.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON GARAGE\n</b>\nEllie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is\nwaiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding\njumps out of the jeep.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Get out, get out!  I need this jeep.\n          There's a problem with the tour.  Ellie,\n          Hammond'll fill you in.\n\nEllie is concerned, the\nn decisive.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          No!  I'm going with you, Muldoon.\n\nThey race out.\n\n\n<b>EXT  DOCK - NIGHT\n</b>\nHeadlights blazing in the darkness, Nedry's jeep skids to a stop by the\ndock where the ANNE B is preparing to leave.  The water is very choppy.\n\nNedry jumps out and pulls his incubator to the ground.  He begins to\ndrag it through the mud, toward the ship.  CAPTAIN FARRELL comes to meet\nhim, along with A COUPLE MEN, who hoist the incubator easily and carry\nit toward the ship.\n\n<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n</b>          Good.  Glad to see you.  Were you seen?\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Nah.

It's worth more\n          than the ship.\n              (to the Captain)\n          When's the copter meeting you?\n\n<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n</b>          It's not.  The storm's coast-to-coast,\n<b>       \n</b>   nobody could land on the water.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>              (totally panicked)\n          Shit!  What's the backup?  I don't like\n          this.  Maybe we should do it another time,\n          I don't like it.  I just don't like -\n\n<b>                            CAPTAIN FARRELL\n</b>          Shhh!  I wired Baker, he'll have a man at\n          the dock in Puntaremas.

I got a lot riding on\n          this too, you know.  No one's going to\n          mess up now.  Baker's not going to mess\n          up.  His people won't let him.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Ok.  Ok.  Here.\n\nNedry pulls an aerosol can out of the baggy crotch of his pants.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Look, this is insulating spray.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry sprays a big mound of white foam into his\n hand,\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          In about eight hours, spray down all the\n          eggs with this stuff.  It'll keep 'em\n          warm but not too warm.  I hope Baker has\n          it together with the dock.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -\n</b>\nRain drums down on the cruiser.  Timmy stares out at the dark.  Lex\nstares nervously out the side window.  Timmy picks up the night goggles\nand snaps them on.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Hey, these thing work great.  I can see\n          in the dark and I can see far.\n\nHe swivels away from the T-Rex paddock and looks out toward the ocean.\nHe reaches up and adjusts the knob.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Hey!  I wonder if that boat's still\n          there?  It is. I think they're getting\n          ready to go.\n\nTIM'S POV - the fluorescent green image of men untying casting lines on\nthe boat.\n\nAnother LIGHTNING FLASH and Lex SCREAMS and covers her face.  She cries.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Timmy, can you\n give her the goggles?\n\nLex clamps her hands over her eyes.  Timmy gently nudges her.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Want to look at the boat, Lex?\n\nTimmy hands her the night goggles. Lex dries her eyes and takes a peek\nwith the goggles toward the ocean.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Hey, that fat guy's down there. Is he\n          gonna come get us and take us to Grandpa?\n\nLEX'S POV - the picture streaks but clearly reveals Nedry shouting at\nthe Captain.  Men heave the incubator onto the ship.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          They have one of those things from the\n          room with all the eggs - you know, where\n          they help the baby eggs grow up.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          You mean an incubator?\n\n<b>                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)\n</b>          What's the commotion?\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Let me see.

He knows he\ngets there too late and reluctantly lets Timmy have it back.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          We saw that computer guy helping 'em load\n          an incubator onto the ship.\n\n<b>                            LEX (TO WALKIE)\n</b>          Yeah, he's stealing them, Dr. Grant!\n          He's stealing my Grandpa's eggs!\n\n<b>                            GRANT (ON WALKIE)\n</b>          Nedry?

No r\nesponse still.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          I wouldn't like to see dinosaurs running\n          around Costa Rica.\n\n<b>                            GENNARO\n</b>          When's the damn power coming on?\n\n\n<b>INT/EXT MULDOON'S JEEP, OTHER BACK ROADS\n</b>\nMuldoon and Ellie drive into the storm.  Suddenly, he slams on his\nbrakes.  In front of him, a tree has fallen, completely blocking the\nroad.  Muldoon curses, swerves around, and skids to a stop.\n\nAs Muldoon gets out and assesses the situation, Ellie lodges herself\nbetween the tree and the jeep.  She pushes the tree with her strong legs\nand moves it a good five feet. Quickly, Muldoon and Ellie drag the tree.\nAs they struggle.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Strong legs.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          Lot of track in college.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON CRUISERS, REST AREA -\n</b>\nIN THE FIRST CAR, Regis drums his fingers on the dashboard.

He can barely make out\nthe car in the dark and rain.  Occasionally, LIGHTNING reveals all.\n\nTIMMY PULLS GUM out of his pocket.  Feels a tiny shake, looks around.\nHe puts it in his mouth, chewing quietly.  SUDDENLY, the whole car\nVIBRATES.  Regis' sunglasses jump off the dashboard and fall to the\nfloor.  The kids look at him.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Must be turning on the electricity.\n\nLex sits up, looks around groggily.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Feels like a vibration.\n\n\n<b>INT  T-REX PADDOCK - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe T-Rex's huge hind feet crash down, one large foot following after\nthe other in long, powerful strides.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON CRUISE\n</b><b>RS, REST AREA - FIRST CRUISER\n</b>\nThere is a thud, and then a THUD, and then a THUD.

Then another SHAKE.\n\nCAMERA PUSHES IN TILL CLOSE - Timmy stares out with his night goggles.\n\nTIM'S NIGHTSCOPE POV IN CLOSE - T-Rex paws rest on the electric fence.\n\nTim takes off his goggles, stares, transfixed.  Regis picks them up.\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP - of muscular forepaws with pebbled, grainy skin and\nthick, curved nails comfortably gripping a thick wire strand.\n\nThe T-Rex moves his body forward of the brush, pushes against the fence.\n\n\n<b>IN THE SECOND CRUISER -\n</b>\nGrant and Gennaro stare out, unseeing in the rain and darkness.\n\n\n<b>CLOSE ON LEX -\n</b>\nTears roll down her cheek.

Gennaro backs up into one of the stalls.\nLOUDER POUNDING, THE WALLS BEGIN TO VIBRATE!  Gennaro assumes a 'tuck'\nposition.\n\nON THE INTERIOR DOOR - The Rex smashes right through the steel-clad\ndoor.

Grant turns to see the Rex return.  He squeezes Lex tight.\nThe animal goes right past them, back to his toy - Tim's land cruiser!\n\nThe Rex BELLOWS a huge cry.  Timmy awakens and sees the Rex above him.\nHe SCREAMS.\n\nLex, squeezed in Grant's arms, sees her imperiled brother.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Timmy!\n\nThe Tyrannosaur looks up, GROWLS across the upside-down cruiser, opens\nits huge jaws menacingly, all the time staring at Grant and Lex.\n\nINSIDE THE CAR - Timmy tries to unwedge himself.  A thin trickle of\nblood runs down his forehead.  He's jammed between the\n crushed roof and\nthe bent bench seat.  He can't free himself.\n\nThe Rex begins to SHOVE the cruiser toward Grant and Lex.  They back up\nbut they have very few feet left - they're almost at the embankment.\nBut if they don't move, they'll by crushed by the oncoming car.\n\nGrant slings Lex onto his back.  She grabs her hands around his neck and\ndigs her feet into his sides.  Grant begins to climb over the downed\nfence and into the embankment - it's a huge drop!\n\nGrant grabs a broken cable and lowers himself and Lex over the side of\nthe embankment.\n\nJust in time as the Rex SHOVES the cruiser further.  Now, the cruiser\nTEETERS right on the edge, turning again on its side.  Tim hangs halfway\nout of the car, unable to get out further.\n\nGrant, with Lex on his back, slides down the cable, rappelling down the\nembankment.  ABOVE, the car looms over them, rocking on the edge.  Lex\nlooks up and grabs Grant so tightly, she chokes him, unknowingly.\n\nGrant, eyes bulging, sees the danger from above.  He pushes off the wall\nand\n swings them toward the next hanging cable.  He reaches out and -\n\n- GRABS THE NEXT CABLE just as -\n\n- the T-Rex BELLOWS and lowers her head, and gives a final shove.  Timmy\nand the cruiser SAIL INTO SPACE.  Timmy SCREAMS!\n\nGrant and Lex swing out of the way as the cruiser sails past them.  Lex\nSCREAMS, squeezing Grant's neck even tighter!   They watch helplessly as\nthe cruiser BOUNCES off the wall and CRASH-LANDS into the top of a tree\nat the base of the wall.\n\nGrant and Lex stare down at the wreck in the tree.  Timmy can't be seen.\nGrant, choking from Lex's grip, grabs her fingers.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Let ... go ... please.\n\nThe Rex ROARS above.  They look up.\n\nTHE REX paws the air, GRUNTS in frustration and STALKS off, LIGHTNING\n<b>FLASHES.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT  NEDRY'S JEEP, BACK ROADS -\n</b>\nNedry speeds along the rain-slick road, fish-tailing as he goes.\n\nCLOSE ON - Nedry at the wheel.\n\nNEDRY'S POV - the dark, wet road running alongside a ten-foot chain-link\nfence.  Suddenly, a beast-like visage blur\ns across the road.\n\nNedry swerves.  The jeep skids.  Nedry tries to over-steer, can't bring\nthe careening jeep under control.\n\nThe jeep crashes though the fence, bounces down a cement culvert, and\ndives into a raging gully.\n\nNedry curses.  He spins the wheel.  The tires spin and spray.  The\njeep's hopelessly stuck in the gully.  From Nedry's seat in the jeep, he\ncranes his head around, examining his situation.\n\nNEDRY'S POV - On the opposite side of the gully, there is an equipment\ngraveyard.  By the titled jeep headlights, steely monsters all around\ncan be seen - discarded earth movers, graders, and tractors.\n\nNedry gets out of the jeep, grabs the winch from the jeep's back end.\nand wades over to an abandoned tractor.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Shit. I'm going to have to change clothes.\n\nHe loops the winch around the tractor's base.  Suddenly, he stops and\nlooks around as he hears a gentle HOOTING.  He squints, looking at the\nstrange steel graveyard lit by the bright beams of the jeep headli\nghts.\n\nHOOT!  HOOT!  A distinctive HOOTING.  Nedry looks up in fear.  SILENCE.\n\nNedry starts moving toward his jeep.  Again, the HOOT!  Nedry stops,\nlooks right, looks left.  A RUSTLE in the trees.  Nedry's head cocks.\n\nLooking through trees, lit by the strong beams, Nedry sees a SPITTER in\nthe eerie mist.  Now it's gone.  Now it's back.  It circles Nedry\nwarily, hunting him.  Nedry stares.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          I hope this is one of them herbivores.\n\nNedry scrambles the other way, full-tilt.  Hop, hop, and the Spitter\ndrops in front of Nedry from the other side.  HOOT!\n\nNedry jumps back, lands on his butt.  The Spitter zips in from the side\n<b>- HOOT!\n</b>\nNedry doubles back, racing through the abandoned equipment, ducking and\nrolling under a cement mixer, spinning past a tree.  He splashes down\nthe embankment, trying to get to his jeep.  He uses the winch line to\nsteady himself again the raging current.  He finally reaches the jeep,\nswings open the door - and, surging out of the water like a\n demonic\napparition, is the SPITTER!  Nedry backs away, directly into the glare\nof the headlights!\n\nCLOSE ON - the Spitter.  It's plume opens, bright orange gills swell out\nlike an umbrella around its neck.  Something squirts beneath its jaws.\n\nA big glob SMACKS Nedry on the arm.  He brushes it off.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          Gross.\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP - the Spitter's head.  The jaws puff, the hood flares\nout, the neck snaps forward.  And - it spits.\n\nThis glob misses Nedry, splashes off the steaming headlight.\n\nVERY EXTREME CLOSEUP - The Spitter's swollen poison sacs are inflated.\nThey fire!\n\nThis glob hits Nedry in the eyes.  He SCREAMS.\n\n<b>                            NEDRY\n</b>          I'm blind, I'm blind.\n\nHe falls against the jeep, rubbing his eyes.  The Spitter calmly hops to\nthe embankment and watches the blinded Nedry weave drunkenly in the\nwater.  Nedry grabs onto the jeep and pulls himself along toward the\ndriver's door.  The Spitter stalks, watching him.\n\nNedry pulls open the jeep door, \nthrusts his head in, slams it against\nthe door frame.  Now Nedry heaves his whole body into the jeep.  The\nSpitter's long ostrich-like legs stretch and bend in an easy gait as it\ncloses it on Nedry.\n\nNedry sits behind the wheel, unseeing as the Spitter watches patiently\nturns his blind eyes that way.\n\nA long beat.  The Spitter leaps forward, the CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDER AND\nWIDER.  Nedry lets out an ear-splitting SCREAM and the car horn BLARES.\n\n\n<b>INT  TIMMY'S CRUISER\n</b>\nTimmy lies against a spidered side window, his head pressed against the\ndoor handle.  He pushes himself up on one elbow, opens his eyes, and\ntries to focus.  Rain has nearly stopped but a light drizzle hits him\n\nTimmy tries to straighten up, but he's too dizzy.  He stops and hears A\nCREAKING and feels the whole car gently swaying back and forth.  With a\nfurther effort, he raises his body so that he's standing with his feet\non the window frame and looks out the broken roof.\n\nTIM'S POV - Dense foliage, moving in the wind, hard to see through.  An\no\npen space and - THE GROUND, FORTY FEET AWAY!\n\n\n<b>INT/EXT  CRUISER - CONTINUING ACTION\n</b>\nTim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a\ntree on the hillside.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Oh shit!\n\nTimmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view.  He\ngrabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand.\n\nCRACK!  The cruiser slips a few inches down the tree.  Timmy grabs the\nwindow frame and freezes.  The car sways in the wind.\n\nCRACK!  The car slips a quick and rocky two feet.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!\n\nTimmy hears something.  He raises his head very carefully.  Climbing up\nthe tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is Dr. Grant.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Timmy.

Let's get you down.\n\nTimmy nods.\n\nGrant peers throug\nh the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing Timmy's\npredicament.  He cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is\nsupported in the tree.  Grant turns back to Timmy.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Try the door you're leaning against.\n          Nice and slow.\n\nTimmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches\nbetween his legs, trying to open the door handle.  Stuck.  CRACK!  The\ncruiser drops another foot.\n\nGrant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser\nagain.  He motions for Timmy to hold still.\n\nGrant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door\nhandle.  This one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door.  Grant\ngingerly holds it half-open in mid-air.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Crawl this way.  Slowly.\n\nCarefully testing his weight with each step, Timmy lowers his body down.\nHe pushes his legs out the door.  They kick in the air and slowly come\nto rest on a lower branch.  He lets himself down.  Now he si\nts on a\nbranch, a few feet below the cruiser.\n\nCRACK!  The cruiser drops.  Grant still hangs onto the door but now his\nfooting on the branch is gone.  His legs hang in space.  The cruiser\nhangs precariously above Timmy.  They're all twenty feet in the air.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          We're going to have to make a jump for\n          it, Timmy.  Okay?\n\nTimmy agrees.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          One, two, three, jump.\n\nTimmy lets go and DROPS.  Grant follows.  So does the cruiser.  It's\nhurtling right at them.\n\nTimmy BANGS against the wet tree-trunk and slides down.  Branches WHIP\nagainst his face, his hands SCRAPE against the trunk.  Grant BOUNCES\nthem.  They scramble down as quick as they can.\n\nTimmy pulls his hands along the sap-sticky surface of the tree.  CRACK!\nGrant is stopped for a terrible instant - doubled over a branch, he\nflips himself over, dropping further.  The cruiser jolts along, just a\nhalf-step behind them.\n\nTimmy dives the last six feet and HITS the wet earth \nwith a THUD!  Grant\nCRASHES next to him.  Before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser\nkeeps coming.  Grant and Timmy look up at it.\n\nGRANT'S POV - The cruiser dropping, dropping toward them.  And finally\nstops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked\nheadlight glaring.\n\nOil drips down on Grant.  He grabs Timmy, who grabs the night goggles.\nThe two roll away.  That second the cruiser SMASHES to the ground.\n\nGrant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to Timmy.  Timmy\nslowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Thanks, Dr. Grant.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          You owe me one.\n\nGrant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Where'd Lex go?\n\nThey hear a faint WHIMPERING.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          There's Lex.\n\nHe runs.  Grant follows.\n\n\n<b>INT  DRAINPIPE -\n</b>\nLex is curled up inside the drainpipe.  Her baseball glove is in her\nmouth and\n she is rocking back and forth, rhythmically banging her head\nagainst the back of the pipe.

We've got to get ourselves back\n          to civilization.\n\n\n<b>EXT  ROADSIDE\n</b>\nRegis slowly crawls out from between a couple large boulders.  He looks\naround carefully.  He peels mud off his face and rubs his neck.\n\nHe touches his cheek.\n\nCLOSE ON Regis' swollen cheek.  He rubs it with his finger.  Suddenly,\nhe swats at his own mouth.  He reaches in and pulls out a leech fat with\nblood.  He hurls it to the ground, spitting.  He grabs another off his\narm and rips if off, leaving a bloody streak.  He digs in his pants and\npulls out another.  He SCREAMS.\n\nAs soon as he has done so, he knows he's made a mistake.  He looks\naround frantically.  Sees the Rex trot down the road toward \nhim.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b>          Noooooo!\n\n\n<b>BACK ON HILLSIDE -\n</b>\nGrant and the kids crest the hill.

Regis'll be ok if he stays still.\n\nAFTER A LONG MOMENT, the tyrannosaur walks away, disappears into the\nshadows.  Regis waits another long moment and releases his tree.\n\nGRANT'S POV - The tyrannosaur leaps out of the shadows and knocks Regis\nto the ground.  Regis jumps up and backs off.  The animal knocks him\nright back down.  Regis jumps up again and screams at the beast.\n\n<b>                            REGIS\n</b><b>    \n</b>      You don't want to hurt Mr. Regis.

Regis SCREAMS and in the middle, the scream cuts off.\n\nGrant lets the goggles fall off his face.  They hit the ground with a\nMETALLIC CLINK.  The Rex turns toward Grant and the kids.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Let's go!\n\nGrant grabs both the kids' hands and they begin to run.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON  TOUR REST AREA -\n</b>\nDrops of water splat on a big fern.

And if\n victims\n          are small, a predator can kill by just\n          shaking the little thing to death, eating\n          it, and leave not so much as a button.\n\nA definite RUSTLING in the brush.\n\nEllie jumps and SCREAMS.  Muldoon puts his hand over her mouth and\npushes her down.  They both squat by the cruiser.  SILENCE.  Ellie\nswallows.  Muldoon slowly gets up.  Ellie follows.\n\nTheir flashlights swing back and forth in the night.  Twigs crack under\ntheir feet.\n\nEllie hears the RUSTLE at the edge of the forest.  She shines her light\ninto the brush.  She catches her breath.  Her hand shakes.\n\nEllie flashes her beam right, left, up, down.  Jumps.  Something is\ncoming at her, rolling at her.  She gasps, steps back.  It's too late.\nIt's Gennaro.  His limp body stops at her feet.  She covers her mouth.\nMuldoon runs to her.\n\nGennaro is face-down.

She smiles.\n\nLEX'S POV - hidden in the brush, a baby triceratops' eye peeks at Lex.\n\nLex pushes the fruit closer.  The BABY TRICERATOPS comes out of the\nbrush, squeaking as it goes.  It nibbles the fruit.  Lex rolls another.\n\nBACK ON GRANT AND TIM - They look around.  Timmy stops, mouth open, YELLS:\n\n<b>                            TIM\n</b>          Dr. Grant, Dr. Grant, look.\n\nGrant turns, looks OFFSCREEN.  He's astonished by when he sees.\n\nHIS POV - a row of shrubs, which Lex seems to soar above.  As a break in\nthe shrubs, it's clear that she's riding the baby triceratops.  Loving it.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Whoa!\n\nWith a whoop, Grant and Timmy chase after Lex on her triceratops.\n\nLex rides through low brush, ducking down as she goes.  Then beneath the\ntall trees as she enters the forest.  She crosses a stream on a log\nb\nridge.  Light showers down through the branches.  The water shimmers.\nLex in is paradise.\n\nBehind her, Grant and Timmy shout for her to stop.  She waves, kicks the\ntriceratops like it's a horse and YELLS:\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Giddyup!\n\nThe trike takes off, in a rush.

He comes up\nsheepish and muddy - and sees Lex standing in a foot of water.\n\nThe baby dinosaur rolls to a stop, mowing down a patch of saplings as\nshe goes.  It stands up, dizzy and out of breath.\n\nTimmy wipes mud off himself.  Grant helps the kids out of the water.\nThe baby triceratops follows them.  Grant yells to the baby trike.\n\n<b>                 \n</b><b>           GRANT\n</b>          Go home now.  Home to Freda!\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Oh, let him stay.

Get out of here!\n\nThe trike whimpers and watches the three of them walk on.  Lex is\nheartbroken.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Will I ever play with him again?\n\nGrant looks across the field, abundantly beautiful in the early morning.\nHe has to keep them going.   He points across the field.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          We gotta get to that motion detector.\n          It's still a ways.\n\nLex looks behind her.  In the distance, more hadrosaurs join the herd\neating from the tall trees.  Some cool off in a shallow lagoon.  They\ndrink, lowering their flat heads, meeting their own reflections in the\nstill water.  When they look up again, their heads swivel.  At the\nwater's \nedge, a baby hadrosaur ventures out, squeaks, and scrambles back\nwhile the adults watch indulgently.\n\n\n<b>EXT  OFF ROAD, PARK - MORNING\n</b>\nMuldoon and his workers now follow the compys on foot.  The compys trail\noff in different directions.  Muldoon and his workers break apart to\ntrack the different groups.\n\nA BEARDED WORKER follows his party of compys.  He looks ahead and sees a\nsmall group stopped ahead.  Their heads are bent to the ground.\n\nA BALD WORKER has reached another cluster of compys.  Kicking, he\nscatters them.\n\nMuldoon's tracking leads him to the equipment graveyard where Nedry was\nlost.  He sees his stolen red jeep.  He rushes to it.  On the passenger\nside still sits the rocket launcher.  He opens the door to retrieve it.\nWhen he leans in, his eye catches the tilted side-view mirror.  The\nimage is of many compys bent over the ground.  He comes around, YELLING.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          I found Nedry!\n\nIn the distance, the call is ECHOED.\n\n<b>                            BEARDED WORKE\n</b><b>R (OFF)\n</b>          I found him!\n\n<b>                            BALD WORKER (OFF)\n</b>          Found him!\n\n\n<b>INT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS - DAY\n</b>\nHammond peeks in the door and sees Gennaro, heavily bandaged, dozing on\nthe couch.

It would be terrible if the\n          finishing funds were in any way held up.\n\nGennaro just grins and shakes his head.  He's very high on morphine.  He\nwants to speak but Hammond keeps talking.  After each sentence, Gennaro\nenthusiastically agrees with a nod.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          You really shouldn't have gotten out of\n          the vehicle.  The park is actually quite\n          safe.  A disenchanted worker sabotaged\n          some equipment.

Behind them the duckbills charge\nwith surprising speed.  Their enormous bodies charge in a tight group,\nkicking up dirt, rocks, whole trees as they thunder along.\n\nCLOSE ON - a charging duckbill as he HONKS, eyes wild with fear.\n\nA horrible ROAR of the T-Rex sends a duckbill infant squealing and\nstruggling to stay out from underfoot.\n\n<b>CLOSE ON\n</b> - A huge adult foot almost tramples the infant.\n\nFrightened and confused the infant scampers even deeper into the\nmaelstrom.  The frenzied herd raises a great cloud of yellow dust.\n\nGRANT AND LEX AND TIMMY run wildly.  The stampede is very close behind\nGrant and the kid's faces are covered with sweat and dust.\n\nAnother deafening ROAR of the T-Rex.\n\nGrant leads them toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers.\nThe animals continue to close.\n\nCLOSE ON - the running feet of the stampeding animals.  The ground\nVIBRATES every time it is struck by the huge feet.\n\nGRANT AND THE KIDS scramble onto the rocks.  They frantically tuck in\nbetween big boulders as the the herd reaches them.  Lex shields her\ndusty face with her hands as she wedges deeper between the rocks.  Grant\npushes her down deeper and looks up from between the rocks.\n\nGRANT'S POV - the immense legs of the first hadrosaur to pass.  Another\nslams its big tail against the rocks, leaving a splash of hot blood.\n\nStampeding legs send clods of dirt fl\nying in the air.  Above, even the\nbirds are running.  Disoriented, they fly frantically along.\n\nGRANT AND THE KIDS are enveloped in dust.  Just shadows of huge bodies\nwith giant limbs.  BELLOWS of pain as animals wheel and circle.\n\nA boulder is dislodged and it rolls toward Timmy.  He dives out of his\nrocky hiding place.  The boulder continues on toward Grant and Lex.\nThey dive after Timmy.  The group buries itself anew in a group of thick\nroots tangled amidst smaller rocks.  The boulder continues on, SMASHING\nthe rocky enclave they have just left.\n\nGrant and the kids huddle and watch the last under-bellies oscillate\nabove them.  The stampede goes past.  They lie there, unable to move.\nThey watch the herd trample on.\n\n\nCLOSE ON - The Rex's foot as it crushes a motion sensor.\n\nLex SCREAMS.  Grant and Timmy cover her mouth.\n\nThe T-Rex hunts down the herd.  He targets his prey.  A young hadrosaur.\n\nAs the hadrosaur gallops into the shadowy treeline, the Rex lunges\nfiercely.  The Rex and its victim are enveloped \nin dust.\n\nGrant holds Lex close.  She watches the terrible cloud with a quiet\nhorror.  Timmy makes the first move to leave.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Let's go.  Now!\n\nThe herd's remainder gallops off into the safety of the deep jungle.\n\nGrant, Lex and Timmy run in the opposite direction.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n</b>\nHammond, Arnold, Wu, and Ellie watch the monitor as the dust slowly\nclears.  Hadrosaurs scatter.\n\nNow the Rex is calm and quiet.  BACK TO CAMERA, he gnaws on something.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          No!  Oh no!  He make a kill.  He killed\n          one of my animals!

Grant and the kids have\nfinally rested enough.  Grant nods to Timmy.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          We'll walk by the river.  That leads back\n          to the Visitor's center.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Not me.

Lex embraces Grant.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          You ready?\n\nShe wipes her tears.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Can we go on the raft?  Then we don't\n          have to walk so close to the animals!\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          What raft?\n\nLex points to a low concrete maintenance building with bars.  It is\ntwenty yards away.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>\n          Where I found Freda's baby.\n\nGrant start to stand.  He's thinking.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          It's still mid-morning.  I bet we have at\n          least ten miles to go.  If we take the\n          raft along the river, we can make much\n          faster progress.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Let's do it.\n\n\n<b>INT  MAINTENANCE BUILDING -\n</b>\nGrant stumbles deep in the gloomy recesses of the building.  He pushes\npast drums of herbicide, tree-pruning equipment, spare tires, coils of\ncyclone fencing, huge fertilizer bags, stacks of ceramic insulators,\nempty motor-oil cans, work-lights and cables.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Lex, I don't see any raft.\n\nTimmy looks at Lex.  Where is it?  Lex doesn't know.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Keep going.\n\nGrant keeps pushing through bags of cement, lengths of copper pipe,\npiles of green mesh.  Two plastic oars hang on the concrete wall.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Bullseye!\n\nTimmy is reliev\ned.  Lex smiles.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Told you!\n\nGrant grabs them.  Looks around, still -\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          No raft. Where did you see it, Lex?\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Actually, I never really saw one. Just\n          assumed.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Assumed?\n\nShe nods.  Grant and Timmy resume looking.\n\nIN THE REAR OF THE BUILDING - Lex walks below a barred window.  Slats of\nlight fall on her back.  She sees a dark closet door ajar.  She brushes\nthe handle.  It swings opens and two bright orange life preservers fall\non her, knocking her to the ground.\n\nLEX SCREAMS, frantically pushing the life preservers off.\n\nGrant's head pops up.  Timmy runs to her side.  She is wrestling\nirrationally with the life preservers.  Timmy drops to the ground.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Lex!  Lex!  You're okay, you're okay!\n\nLex is overcome with fear.  Timmy grabs a preservers and puts it on.\n\n<b>                            TIMM\n</b><b>Y\n</b>          Look, Lex!  Look!\n\nShe looks at him, realizes, and bursts out laughing.  Timmy laughs with\nher.  Grant joins them.  He sits on a box and laughs.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          I'm afraid there's no raft.\n\nGrant gets up.  He reaches for the hands of the kids.  Timmy sees it -\nthe box Grant sat on is labeled: RAFT STORAGE.  Timmy smiles..\n\n\n<b>AT THE RIVER'S EDGE -\n</b>\nGrant pulls a cord.\n\nWith a LOUD HISS, the rubber begins to expand uncontrollably, jerking\nand jumping like a wild marionette.  Then, with a whopping HISS-WHAP! it\npops fully open on the deck: a large bright yellow rubber raft.\n\nTimmy and Lex climb in, wearing the life preservers.  Grant gets in and\npushes off with his oars.\n\nThe small disturbance causes the cicadas to ROAR.  The raft drifts out\ninto the lagoon.  Grant fixes his oars into the oarlocks.\n\nGrant surveys the river.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Looks pretty calm.\n\nTHUMP.  The raft stops moving.  They are aground.  Lex looks overboard.\nShe reaches in\n about elbow deep.\n\nGrant stands and puts the oars in the water.  He pushes with all his\nmight.  There is a long scraping sound of the raft against the mud\nfloor.  But it moves.  And the raft goes into deep enough water.\n\nA general sigh of relief as they gently float downstream.\n\n\n<b>A WIDE AREA OF THE RIVER -\n</b>\nGrant energetically works the oars.\n\nCLOSE ON - Lex lets her hand trail in the water.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          I'll row, Dr. Grant.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          No.\n\nBut he's sweating and takes a moment to rest.  Lex looks down at her\nhand in the water.  It still trails.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Hey, we're still moving.\n\nGrant looks into the water.  She's right.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          There's a current.\n\nGrant lays back against the rubber gunwales, closes his eyes.  The two\nkids look at him.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          You can't sleep.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>              (eyes closed)\n          I'm not sl\neeping... yet.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          I'll do it!\n\nLex picks up the oars and begins.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          We gotta warn them about the boat.\n\nGrant opens one eye and looks up at the sun in the sky.  He sighs and\ntakes up the oars again.  He rows powerfully with the current.\n\n\n<b>A BEND IN THE RIVER -\n</b>\nCurrent picks up speed.  The water begins to rush and ROAR.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Cool!\n\nWhite foam crashes on the raft and sprays the kids.  They burst out\nlaughing.  Grant smiles at them, but there is concern in his eyes.\n\n\n<b>ANOTHER BEND -\n</b>\nNow the raft is really racing.  The kids hold on tightly as the raft is\nrocked.  White water crashed over, drenching the kids.  When Grant takes\na moment to look, he is soaked by a huge wave.\n\nThe raft tosses right and left.  Timmy holds the rubber grips.  He's\nyanked to one side.  He's knocked to the raft floor.  Quickly gets his\ngrip again.  SHOUTS to Grant.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Thought\n is looked calm?\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Guess I was wrong.\n\nGrant looks ahead.  The river widens.  The raft really starts to fly.\n\nLex, gripping very tightly, looks out.  Water sprays her again and\nagain.  Her face is serious.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          I can't swim!\n\nGrant grabs the raft's tie line and pulls it out of its rubber rings.\nHe lashes it around Lex and Timmy.  Then he ties it around one of the\nrubber grips.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Hold on real tight.\n\nThey go flying down the river.  The ROAR deafens.\n\nThe raft lifts out of the water.  And crashes down, rocking every way.\n\nJagged rocks appear.  Grant uses his paddle as a club to push off the\nrocks and the rushing shoreline.  The kids duck from sudden overhanging\ntrees.\n\nGrant looks ahead.  He blanches.\n\nHIS POV - the surging edge of a tumultuous waterfall.\n\nThey're almost there.  At the huge waterfall, water rushes violently,\nheaving over the magnificent precipice.\n\nTimmy tries to tighten L\nex's vest but is thrown back down .  He YELLS:\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Hold my hand.  Hold my hand when we go.\n\nThe raft spins in the rushing water.  Everyone is thrown around.\n\nThe rope holding the kids to the raft tautens. The oars are wrestled out\nof Grant's hands and go flying through the air, spilling over the edge.\n\nAt the last moment, Grant spots a tree branch arching over the cascade.\nWith all his might, he stands and holds his balance long enough. to let\nhis hands smash into the overhanging branch.\n\nThey stop right at the waterfall's edge.\n\nGrant struggles mightily to hold onto the branch.  But the water keeps\nrushing.  His strength ebbs.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Don't let go!\n\nGrant's veins pop out in his arms.  His hands start to slip off the wet\ntree bark.  Lex watches his hands slowly lose their grip.\n\nThe rubber raft jumps and leaps below him.  Water pours into the raft.\nLex tries fruitlessly to let it out.  Timmy holds down Grant's feet.\n\n<b>               \n</b><b>             TIMMY\n</b>          You can do it!\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          I'm trying.  I'm trying ... Ooooo!!! ....\n\nHis hands slipping, slipping ...\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          No!!!!!\n\n<b>                                                      CUT TO:\n</b>\nCLOSE ON - The T-Rex, face down in the mud.\n\n\n<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nArnold, Wu, Muldoon, and Ellie stare raptly at the monitor.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Son-of-a-bitch.  He's taking a nap.\n          Hasn't been this well fed ... ever.\n\nHammond is above, in his throne.  He calls down:\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          Could he drown in that position?  That's\n          a very valuable animal.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          I know it's a valuable animal.\n\nMuldoon takes a step up toward Hammond's throne and the two argue\nquietly back and forth.  In the foreground, Wu calls Arnold over.\n\n<b>                            WU\n</b>          What's that, John?\n\nWu points to the screen behind \nArnold's head.  In the upper right-hand\ncorner, it blinks a yellow warning:  AUX PWR LOW!  Ellie regards it.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          You running on auxiliary power?\n\n<b>                            ARNOLD\n</b>          I'm not.\n\n<b>                            WU\n</b>          Looks like you are.\n\n<b>                            ARNOLD\n</b>          Can't be.\n\n<b>                            WU\n</b>          Print the system status log.\n\nArnold nods and rapidly strikes keys.  In the corner, a printer whirs to\nlife.  Moments later, it spins out a single page.  Arnold tears it off.\n\nEllie continues to stare at the screen.  It now flashes red:  AUX PWR\nFAIL!  An alarm klaxon BLARES.\n\nHammond holds his ears against the noise.  He stands up.\n\nThe room lights begin to FLASH.  They're reflected in Hammond's eyes.\nHammond ROARS above the chaos.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          What the hell is going on?\n\nOnscreen, numbers begin to count backward from ten.  Hammond lurches.\nAt zero, the lights go off, the monitors,\n even the computer.  Just the\nalarms keep screaming.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          You're ruining my ordered, precise park!\n\nArnold ignores him, keeps pressing buttons.  Hammond rushes toward\nArnold.  Arnold looks over his shoulder in surprise.  Hammond SCREAMS.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          Fix my park, Arnold!  Fix it!\n\nArnold crosses his hands in front of his face, blocking Hammond's\nattack.  Hammond grabs Arnold's wrists and the two twirl to the ground.\nBreathing heavily, Hammond clutches his hand to his own chest.\n\nArnold stands up, brushes off.  He puts himself together, looks at\nHammond.  He SHOUTS over the siren:\n\n<b>                            ARNOLD\n</b>          I know it's hard, I know it's hard, but\n          I'm going to put it all back together for\n          you - I promise.  I will\n\n\n<b>BACK ON RAFT AT WATERFALL -\n</b>\nGrant still clings to the overhanging branch, holding the raft from\ntoppling over the crashing waterfall.  Lex and Timmy hold onto his legs.\n\nThe ROAR of the\n water diminishes.  And the flow subsides from a raging\ncurrent to a rolling river.  And then to a gentle stream.  A trickle.\nNothing.\n\nGrant slowly relaxes, lets go.  So do the children.  Around the raft,\nthe water level begins to drain.  Gradually, Grant and the kids are left\nin the raft sitting in just a few puddles of water.  Around them,\nvarious pumps and other equipment is exposed where it was once covered\nby rushing white water.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          The waterfall stopped.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Waterfalls aren't supposed to stop.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          I think they cut the power.  Hey -\n\nHe points and the three of them look over the edge where the waterfall\nonce poured.  There's a shimmering rainbow and beyond that, in the mist\nis the visitor's center.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Well, there's our pot of gold.  Let's go,\n          kids.\n\nThey grab his hands and clamber out of the raft, running toward shore.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON CON\n</b><b>TROL ROOM -\n</b>\nMuldoon pulls open the blinds and the hot sun filters in, so the room is\nalternate patches of bright and dark.\n\nIn a hot corner, Ellie squats over a prostate Hammond, mopping his brow\nwith a cool cloth.  He murmurs, only barely intelligible.\n\n<b>                            HAMMOND\n</b>          Told him, fix my park, fix my park.\n\nWu brings the printout to Arnold.  The printout is a chronological\nrendering of control room events since the restart.  It is clear they\nhave been running on auxiliary power.

In the distance, the alarm still SOUNDS,\nlights FLASH a continued warning.\n\nThey reach the maintenance building where the generator is housed.  Its\nfamiliar him has been replaced by its own alarms.  The closer they\napproach, the louder and brighter these alarms are.

It's empty.\n\nMuldoon looks up.\n\nMULDOON'S POV - the dense forest surrounding the Visitor's Center.\n\nMuldoon examines the ground.  He locates the raptor prints leading away\n\nMuldoon breaks into a run.\n\n\n<b>INT/EXT  GENERATOR ROOM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nMuldoon comes back to the generator room still runnin\ng full-tilt.

He steps in the doorway and\nshines his flashlight around.\n\nMULDOON'S POV - Only the dark abstract shapes of rakes and coiled ropes\nand small machinery can be seen in the steam.\n\nMuldoon yells again.  No answer at all.  Muldoon curses and leaves.\n\nAs soon as Muldoon is gone, there is movement.  Even above the sirens,\nan animalistic breathing, grunting can be heard.  Obscured by steam and\nflashing lights, a reptilian claw clutches a shadow.  A pack of\ncigarettes falls to the ground, spilling out on the floor.\n\n\n<b>INT  CONTROL ROOM - AFTERNOON\n</b>\nMuldoon enters and confronts Hammond, Ellie, and Wu,\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Raptors chewed their way out.

Next to him is Ellie.  Behind both of them,\nlauncher at the ready, is Muldoon.  Watching from the window above,\nHammond waves.  Ellie and Wu wear radio headsets.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Okay Wu, I'll have you covered at every\n          moment.

If another ones come at you,\n          let her know.  Then Ellie - you start\n          jumping and yelling.  The buggers are\n          easily distracted.  They'll come running\n          and let Wu get that power on.  Then both\n          of you, get behind this fence as quick as\n          possible.\n\nWu and Ellie nod seriously and test radio contact.  We starts his way\nacross the lawn, Muldoon limps behind with his launcher.  Ellie stands\nready at the open \ngate.\n\nWu takes slow steps.  Muldoon follows.  Wu is just five feet away from\nthe door to the generator building.\n\nCLOSE ON - Wu's tense face.\n\nTHE ATTACK is sudden and fierce.  It comes from the brush.  The raptor\nleaps onto Wu in an instant.  Wu and the raptor roll on the ground.  Wu\nstruggles for his life.  Muldoon can't get a safe shot.  He SCREAM:\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Wu, get away.  Give me room to shoot.\n\nEllie comes running away from the safety of the gate.

Hey, come and get me, you\n          flat-snouted Mongolian beast.  Hey!\n\nThe Raptor is distracted by this.  He lets Wu go for a moment, shaking\nhim loose from his bloody jaws.  Instantly, Wu rolls away.  Muldoon\nfires the rocket launcher.  With a SIZZLE, the missile fires.  BOOM!\nDirect hit!  The raptor is blown to tiny pieces.\n\nMuldoon grabs Wu and pulls the inju\nred man to safety.\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          You ok?\n\nIn reply Wu gets to his feet, looks where the Raptor was.\n\n<b>                            WU\n</b>          Now, there's four.\n\nMuldoon helps Wu back inside the fence.

Muldoon, cover the door\n          after I go in.  Wu, guide me!\n\nMuldoon yells for her to wait but stops when he realizes that this may\nbe their best plan.\n\nEllie races like a gazelle across the open lawn.  She's very fast and\ngraceful.  She ducks into the generator building.\n\nAbove it all, Hammond watches at the small viewing window.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON - GRANT AND KIDS AT FENCE\n</b>\nThe three are at the top of the fence now.  Grant carefully lifts Lex\nabove the barbed wire and she grabs onto the other side of the fence to\nbegin the climb down.  Grant grabs Tim and lifts him next.  Tim's tense\nface is a river of sweat.\n\n\n<b>INT  GE\n</b><b>NERATOR BUILDING -\n</b>\nEllie finishes the stairs and feels her way along the basement wall.\nHer face is lit by a flashing yellow light.

She counts:\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          One -\n\n\n<b>BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -\n</b>\nJust a few feet from the bottom of the fence.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON ELLIE -\n</b>\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          Two -\n\n\n<b>BACK ON GRANT AND KIDS -\n</b>\nGrant and Timmy jump down. \n Lex is just behind.

Grant smiles, high-fives Timmy.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON ELLIE -\n</b>\nThe siren and the flashing lights stop.  The room lights go on.  Ellie\nturns to go back upstairs.  Her foot slips, she falls to the ground.\nShe has slipped on a pool of blood.  She jumps up, recoils.\n\nIt's Arnold.  She squelches a SCREAM, covering her own mouth.\n\nSMASH!  Ellie SCREAMS as a raptor lunges at her.   He jumps down\n from\nabove the water pipe Ellie banged her head on.\n\nEllie turns and races toward a ventilation shaft.  She dives into it.\nThe raptor gets there a second late and smashes against the shaft wall.\n\nEllie pushes herself against the shaft wall and, using her legs to push\nagainst the wall, begins to climb up.\n\nThe raptor smashes against the shaft again and gets inside.  Ellie\nscrambles up.  The raptor snarls and spits but it is momentarily pinned.\n\nEllie continues her scramble up the shaft.  At ground level, she slams\nher feet hard against a vent, popping it open.  Scraping the wall and\nbanging against pipes, she races toward the door.\n\n\n<b>EXT  GENERATOR BUILDING - CONTINUING ACTION\n</b>\nEllie runs full-tilt toward the fence surrounding Hammond's quarters.\nWu, injured, lies within the safety of the fenced area.  Muldoon stands\nwith his rocket launcher just outside the fence waiting for Ellie.\nEllie screams to him as she speeds across the lawn.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          Raptor!\n\nThe raptor EXPLODES th\nrough the door of the generator building after\nEllie.\n\nMuldoon fires at the raptor. Misses.  No time to reload.\n\nThe raptor gains on Ellie.  Muldoon ducks inside the fence's heavy gate.\nHe slides the gate half-shut, waving Ellie on.\n\nEllie dives inside the safety of the fence, losing her headset as she\ngoes.  The gate is almost closed.  The raptor lunges.\n\nMuldoon slides shut the heavy gate, bashing the raptor's head with all\nhis might.  The raptor shudders, caught in the gate.  Stunned, for a\nsecond, it doesn't move.\n\nEllie and Muldoon run to the building.  They push open the steel-clad\nsecurity door and dive inside.  Wu limping, chases after them.  With a\ncurse, Muldoon pushes the door back open, waves for Wu.\n\nELLIE AND MULDOON'S POV - Wu runs frantically.  The raptor jerks out of\nthe gate, inside of the fence.  He races after Wu.\n\n<b>                            WU\n</b>          Keep it open!  I'm coming!\n\nWu runs faster.  The raptor gains on him.

The children huddle together in a\ncorner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.\n\nIt's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it\nstudies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes\nflick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.\n\nTimmy grabs the box of toy dinosaurs.  He winds one up and sends it off\nacross the hall.  The raptor glances over at the moving toy.  Timmy\ngrabs another, whispers as he winds it.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Start winding now!\n\nLex and Timmy wind toy after toy, send th\nem across the hall.  The raptor\nleaps, crushing one in its jaws.  Others waddle by.  The raptor dodges\nand darts, grabbing this one, smashing that one.\n\nThe kids go running out into the hall.  They race down the Visitor\nCenter corridor.  Timmy pulls Lex behind him toward the restaurant.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          Where are we going?\n\n<b>                            TIM\n</b>          The kitchen!\n\n\n<b>INT/EXT  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n</b>\nWith a huge leap, the raptor finally makes it to the roof of Hammond's\nquarters.  He jumps lightly onto the skylight.  Glass shatters over the\nassembled guests and workers below.  Total commotion and SCREAMS.\n\nThe raptor immediately begins to gnaw at the iron bars that block the\nskylight.  Below, they shake off shards of glass and huddle in the\ncorners.  Ellie turns to Muldoon.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          How long?\n\n<b>                            MULDOON\n</b>          Well, they seem to be getting faster all\n          the time. I would say - fifteen minutes.\n\nEllie no\ntices something out the window.  It's Grant approaching the\ngate.  She hammers on the glass.\n\nGrant's hand reaches for the knob.\n\nThe raptor stops gnawing, its ears perked up.\n\nEllie screams and screams.\n\nGrant notices some of Wu's remains inside the gate.  He stops and looks\nup.  At the window, Ellie waves her arms, warning him not to enter.\nGrant stops.  He sees Wu's headset on the grass, reaches through the\nfence, grabs it, puts it on.\n\nEllie jumps up and gets her headset.  She barks into it.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          There's a raptor on the roof of this\n          building.  Open that gate and you're a\n          dead man.\n\nGrant stares up at Ellie in the window.  He waves.  She presses her hand\nto the glass.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Ellie, I'm go glad -\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          Shut up and listen.

Besides the r\naptor\n          stuck in here with us, there are four\n          more ...\n\nGrant races back to the Visitor's Center as she continues to fill him in.\n\n\n<b>INT  KITCHEN, VISITOR'S CENTER - CONTINUING ACTION\n</b>\nThe kids hurtle through this huge, industrial kitchen.  The kitchen is a\nmaze of turns, from the hot lamp pickup area to the rows of stainless\nsteel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids\ndart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,\ncrawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.\n\nRelentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids\ntheir obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their\nshortcuts, it just continues around.\n\nTimmy pulls open the large silvered door of the freezer.  Lex starts to\nhurry inside.  Timmy grabs her.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          We'll freeze to death in there.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          He's going to eat us!\n\nTimmy reaches into the freezer and grabs a pile \nof steaks.  He tosses one\ntoward the raptor.  The raptor gobbles it in one bite.  Timmy shoves Lex\nout of the way and begins to toss the steaks on the floor.  One after the\nother, he tosses them, in a row, closer and closer to the open freezer.\n\nThe raptor mechanically gobbles the steaks, following their path.  He\ncontinues right into the freezer to grab the last of Tim's bait.\n\nTim leaps and slams the heavy freezer door shut.  Lex comes running and\nthrows her small weight alongside of Timmy's.\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b><b>          PUSH!\n</b>\nThe heave and the lock catches on the door.  From inside, there is a\nstrangled CRY and the door is slammed repeatedly.  The metal panels of\nthe door buckle but they do not break.  The door hinges bend and curve\nbut they do not give.\n\nThe kids collapse in relief on the kitchen floor.  In just a moment,\nTimmy is back on his feet.\n\n<b>                            LEX\n</b>          What is it, Timmy?\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          I just remembered something.

He sniffs the air and examines the crushed windup\ntoys.  He sees some animal scales on the floor.  He hears a NOISE above\nand begins to run.\n\n\n<b>INT  UPPER FLOOR HALLWAY, VISITOR'S CENTER -\n</b>\nThe kids hear this NOISE too and it's closer to them.  They bust into -\n\n\n<b>INT  AMBER ROOM, LABORATORY -\n</b>\nThe kids knock over trays of stones as they rush through this room.\n\n\n<b>INT  EXTRACTION ROOM, LABORATORY -\n</b>\nAutomated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment\nto the ground.  The drills still whir on the ground.\n\n\n<b>INT  GENETICS ROOM -\n</b>\nThe Hamachi-Hood sequencers explode in a heap of punch cards and\nmagnetic tape as the kids race by.\n\n\n<b>INT  INCUBATION ROOM, LABORATORY -\n</b>\nThe kids slide int\no this room.  They race to its far corner, past\nincubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -\n\nKID'S POV - A raptor happily gorging itself on a table of eggs.  He's\nbeen in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.\n\nCLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.\n\nHe begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.\n\nThe raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his\nyounger sister.\n\nCLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.\n\nAt the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the\nsituation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one\nof the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He\ncomes out with a syringe and a vial.\n\nThe raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The\nraptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.\n\nGrant speaks into the headset.\n\n<b>                            GRANT (TO RADIO)\n</b>          Talk, Ellie, just keep talking.\n\nHe tosses the headset on the ground.  Ellie's voice crackles out.  The\nraptor studies it, transfixed.\n\nGrant injects the egg, then gently rolls it on the ground.  The raptor\nforgets the headset.  He comes forward and sniffs the egg, then sucks it\nup, swallowing it whole.\n\nThe raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,\ntenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.\n\nThe kids race around the dead raptor to Grant.  Grant grabs his headset\nas the three run out of the room.  Grant addresses Timmy as they run.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>          Timmy, you know anything about computers?\n\n<b>                            TIMMY\n</b>          Well, I just got an XT at home.

He reaches out and touches a part\nof the screen.  There is a beep and a warning sign - INVALID ARGUMENT.\n<b>PLEASE TRY AGAIN.\n</b>\n\n<b>BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n</b>\nThe raptor has chewed almost all the way through the bars.

He punches the ESCAPE button.\n\nThe screen lights up a new message - SYSTEM RESET COMPLETED.  ALL\n<b>SYSTEMS NORMAL.\n</b>\n\n<b>BACK ON  HAMMOND'S QUARTERS -\n</b>\nThe raptor has just chewed through.  He squeezes his body into the space\nas the bars ELECTRIFY.  Spastically, the raptor jerks back and forth as\nthe current flows through him.  He can't get out.\n\nFinally, with a WHIMPER, he stops struggling and slides through the\nspace he created.  With a THUMP, he drops to the floor below.\n\nEllie, Muldoon, Hammond and the workers look on in shock.\n\n\n<b>BACK ON  CONTROL ROOM -\n</b>\nGrant cheers and hugs Timmy.

Glass goes flying.  Grant and kids go running into the hallway.\n\n\n<b>INT ROTUNDA -\n</b>\nWith the raptor in hot pursuit, the kids and Grant come flying.  Tim and\nLex jump over the railing, leaping onto the skeletal display.  Grant\ngoes for the stairs, jumping down them three at a time.\n\nThe raptor goes after the kids, scrambling over the balcony onto the\ndisplay.  The kids scamper down the display, knocking paint cans and\ntools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat\nbehind, and his snar\nling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.\n\nThe kids burrow into the rib cage of the Rex.  They break off floating\nrubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,\nclosing the gap on the kids.\n\nThe kids are stuck at the end of the rib cage - it's closed off by the\nskeleton and they can't break through.  They're imprisoned.  The raptor\nis pushing through the rib cage, bones crackling as it goes.\n\nGrant leaps up the scaffolding, grabs a beam, swings his weight onto it,\nand slams it into the T-Rex's neck.  The neck shatters and the massive\nhead of the T-Rex drops free.\n\nIt falls directly onto the last raptor, squashing him flat.  Dead.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b>              (grimly)\n          And then there were none.\n\n\n<b>EXT  HELICOPTER PAD - DUSK\n</b>\nMuldoon leads his workers onto an army helicopter.

She give him a big smile.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          You have a theory?\n\nGrant smiles back at her.\n\n<b>                            GRANT\n</b><b>   \n</b>       I think that they could never completely          \n          isolate the dinosaur DNA.  There was\n          always some microscopic mosquito\n          contamination.  But at the molecular\n          level, that was enough.  Every dinosaur\n          received the same genetic massage, the\n          encoding that every mosquito gets to\n          terminate life after a season.\n\n<b>                            ELLIE\n</b>          So the very process itself was flawed.\n\nShe's sad.  Grant hugs her.  Over her shoulder he gives a parting glance\nto the island.  A green jewel in a blue sea.  Suddenly it is obliterated\nby clouds.\n\nCAMERA PANS AWAY AND SWOOPS DOWN from the copter.  IT CROSSES the sky.\nTHE CAMERA DESCENDS to Isla Nublar, slowly reveling in its natural\nbeauty and finally coming to earth in the midst of the verdant jungle.\n\n\n<b>IN THE JUNGLE - MAGIC HOUR\n</b>\nHammond slowly climbs a steep hill covered with creeping growth.  He\nalmost reaches the top when he slips.  He falls to the soft ground and\nrolls. He tumbles he\nlplessly, rolling and spinning down the sharp drop,\nfinally coming to a complete stop in a shallow pool of water.  Face\ndown, his head splashes into the puddle.  No movement. Just the sound of\nlabored breath.\n\nCAMERA PANS to Hammond's hand, half-submerged in water.  CAMERA MOVES\nINTO EXTREME CLOSEUP as a mosquito lands on his hand.\n\n<b>                                         RACK OUT AND DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT  OCEAN - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe army copter circles lower and lower as it finds the Queen Anne B,\nslowly drifting across the moonlit water.\n\n<b>                                                      FADE OUT.\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Jurassic Park</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=David Koepp\" title=\"Scripts by David Koepp\">David Koepp</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Adventure\" title=\"Adventure Scripts\">Adventure</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Sci-Fi\" title=\"Sci-Fi Scripts\">Sci-Fi</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Jurassic Park Script.html#comments\" title=\"Jurassic Park comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:08:57.011647"}
