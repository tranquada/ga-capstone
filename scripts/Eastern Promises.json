A STREET NEAR BRICK LANE - EVENING                       1\r\n</b>\r\n    It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The\r\n    scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.\r\n    A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish\r\n    newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional\r\n    barber's shop called Ozim's.\r\n\r\n<b>2   INT. OZIM'S BARBER SHOP - EVENING                             2\r\n</b>\r\n    The shutters are drawn. OZIM (a plump middle-aged Turk)\r\n    is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (SOYKA).\r\n    Soyka is a Chechen, well-groomed, wearing a sharp suit\r\n    beneath the barber's gown.\r\n\r\n    During the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle- and\r\n    star-shaped tattoos on Soyka's arms and hands.\r\n\r\n    Ozim and Soyka are chatting as Ekrem enters.   Soyka speaks\r\n    with a Russian accent.\r\n\r\n<b>                           OZIM\r\n</b>              Guvenilmez... daginik... bloody\r\n              kids, you know... he says - `but\r\n              Amca it's Christmas?...

We\r\n    pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are\r\n    hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)\r\n    hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown\r\n    with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair\r\n    is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.\r\n    She is barefoot.\r\n\r\n<b>4   INT.
