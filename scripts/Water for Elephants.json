She trots ahead of August and\r\n          then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt\r\n          awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:\r\n          The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.\r\n          August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,\r\n          starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting\r\n          comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..\r\n          But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real\r\n          anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.\r\n          After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook\r\n          sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a\r\n          faster speed, curling her trunk in the air.

Jacob wants to run to help her...\r\n          But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the\r\n          pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is\r\n          facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.\r\n          Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band\r\n          Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a\r\n          drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.\r\n          Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll\r\n          mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,\r\n          she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air\r\n          tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for\r\n          one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her\r\n          feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.\r\n          The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are\r\n          thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.\r\n          August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if\r\n          it were all his creation.\r\n          But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she\r\n          turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top.

Tuxedoed\r\n          bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of\r\n          bottles in front of a smoky mirror.\r\n          August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on\r\n          their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a\r\n          beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his\r\n          eyes off of her.\r\n          Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this\r\n          wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she\r\n          keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.\r\n          However, she is acting distant to August.\r\n          August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides\r\n          next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;\r\n\r\n<b>                         AUGUST\r\n</b>          Would you like to dance, darling?\r\n\r\n<b>                         MARLENA\r\n</b>          No, thank you.\r\n          Awkward beat.

He exits O.S.\r\n\r\n<b>                         JACOB\r\n</b>          You ever going to let him off the\r\n          hook?\r\n\r\n<b>                         MARLENA\r\n</b>          Hook?

Marlena dances light\r\n          as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so\r\n          that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone\r\n          - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her\r\n          hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she\r\n          unwinds away from, like a ribbon.\r\n          When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -\r\n          including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:\r\n          August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The\r\n          dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.\r\n          Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;\r\n\r\n<b>          OFF CAMERA SHOUT\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          RAID!! RAAAAID!!!

Marlena is shoved\r\n          along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.\r\n          Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By\r\n          Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob\r\n          scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are\r\n          strangers running in every direction, people screaming..\r\n          Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          81.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>          EXT.
