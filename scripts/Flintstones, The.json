SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1\n\n    FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his\n    faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch\n    that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry\n    wall.\n\n2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2\n    looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a\n    wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time...\n    Millerock time!\n    Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle\n    bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of\n    the workday --\n\n3   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              3\n                             FRED\n               YABBA DABBA DO -- !\n    Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the\n    canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the\n    tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and\n    timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only\n    motor (his feet), slows to allow a \"time clock\" dinosaur\n    to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back\n    up to speed and out of the gate!

A\n    moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking\n    just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat\n    behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the\n    saber-toothed cat.\n    Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN...

He takes a giant sea shell\n    \"speaker\" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his\n    car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma.\n    (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through\n    the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and\n    puts them on his head for a better view.

Giant\n    DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from\n    a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land.\n    (The third one out carries a little suitcase.)\n\n    CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a\n    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,\n    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then\n    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-\n    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.\n    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a\n    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)\n\n    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs\n    over the Xenosaurus.\n\n7   NEW ANGLE                                                  7\n\n    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize\n    that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the\n    shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads\n    BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE\n    EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and\n    we see -- Bedrock!\n                                              (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                           3.\n\n7    CONTINUED:                                                 7\n     Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming\n     protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light.\n\n     The Xenosaurus grabs its sack and some silverware spills\n     out. Then it runs off into the bushes and out of sight.\n\n8    WITH THAT GARBAGE TRUCK                                    8\n\n     It reaches the crest of a hill where there's a \"WELCOME\n     TO BEDROCK\" billboard which bears greetings from the\n     Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce, and (of course)\n     The Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes. The garbage truck\n     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and\n     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.\n     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and\n     the rear guys hop off. One of them waves to --\n\n9    A MILKMAN                                                  9\n     who returns the wave, then takes a four-pack of stone\n     bottles out of his milk truck, heads towards a doorway.\n     As the milkman drops off the milk, he passes a big\n     TORTOISE with trash cans on its back. The Tortoise\n     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the\n     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The garbage men take the cans\n     off the Tortoise's back, dump them into the truck.\n10   REAR OF TRUCK                                              10\n     -- revealing   that the back of the truck is actually a\n     giant-jawed   CREATURE strapped onto the chassis. The\n     garbage men   dump the cans into its maw... it happily\n     swallows the   works, licks its lips, BELCHES.\n11   BACK TO SCENE                                              11\n\n     The garbagemen slam the cans back on the Tortoise, who\n     winces as they drive off.\n                                TORTOISE\n                         (under his breath)\n                  You can forget about a tip for\n                  Christmas...\n\n     It waddles back up the lawn... passing by a wooden \"lawn\n     timer\" box which now pops open.\n     Inside the box is a \"ROOSTERSAURUS\" which CROWS and flaps\n     its wings. The motion of the wings knocks loose two\n     round stones which roll down two long troughs a la Rube\n     Goldberg...\n\n                                                          4.\n\n12   FOLLOWING THE ROUND STONES                                12\n     They reach the ends of their respective paths, dislodging\n     a stick... that releases a coiled rope which in turn\n     spins a turntable which holds a little wooly mammoth. As\n     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its\n     snout.\n\n     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat\n     this performance. After a moment, they gradually slow\n     their revolutions. The one closest to the house\n     scrunches its trunk with a GROAN.\n\n                             LITTLE MAMMOTH\n                      (sotto)\n               Oh, my aching sinuses...\n\n13   INT. FLINTSTONES' BEDROOM - DAY                           13\n\n     WIDEN FROM the windowsill, where a little sea shell\n     hearing aid trumpet AMPLIFIES another ROOSTERSAURUS\n     \"COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO\" into the ear of a \"CLOCK RADIO\n     WOODPECKER.\" The Woodpecker yawns, gets out of bed,\n     puts a timecard in a little clock. Then it turns\n     and begins pecking on a BELL, which RINGS PIERCINGLY.\n\n14   INT. BEDROOM - NEW ANGLE                                  14\n     Two shapes are visible under the bedclothes: One is a\n     great SNORING bulge, the other is a svelte and lithe\n     shape. As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge\n     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then\n     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper\n     is thrown without aiming --\n15   THE WOODPECKER                                            15\n     ducks just in time.

Then some\n      rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour-\n      aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some\n      stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite\n      begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while\n      Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams\n      which he flings below.\n145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145\n\n      Winds up for another   baseball-type swing -- but as he\n      follows through, the   ball-shaped light fixture jerks up\n      on its cable.

Dino\n      runs in first, followed by Wilma with Pebbles already\n      asleep on her shoulder. Fred follows, the saber-tooth\n      cat on his heels. Fred stops in the doorway to put a\n      milk bottle on the doorstep, and then puts the cat down\n      beside it. He shuts the door.\n      Quick as a flash, the cat leaps through the side window.\n      Pause. The door opens and the cat puts Fred out, then\n      slams the door! Fred recovers from his shock, tries the\n      door... it's locked!\n\n                                 MUSIC (V.O.)\n                   We'll have a yabba\n                   dabba-do time\n                   A dabba-do time\n                   We'll have a gay old time!\n                                 FRED\n                          (knocking)\n                   Wilma...?\n                          (another knock)\n                   ...
