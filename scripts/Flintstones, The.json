With a\n    DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange,\n    hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then\n    WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven-\n    foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus.\n    It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a\n    canvas sack, but we don't stress this.)\n\n    Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs\n    over the Xenosaurus.\n\n<b>7   NEW ANGLE                                                  7\n</b>\n    Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up.

The garbage truck\n     guys drop their feet down through the floorboard and\n     trot over the rise, coast down to the street below.\n     The driver yanks a wooden brake and the truck stops, and\n     the rear guys hop off.

The Tortoise\n     nods familiarly to the milkman, then it waddles down the\n     curb, CAMERA FOLLOWING.

As\n     it begins to spin around, it squirts water out of its\n     snout.\n\n     Elsewhere on the lawn, other spinning MAMMOTHS repeat\n     this performance.

As the BELL continues RINGING, the larger bulge\n     GRUNTS, MOANS, pulls a pillow over its head, and then\n     finally gropes under the bed for a slipper. The slipper\n     is thrown without aiming --\n<b>15   THE WOODPECKER                                            15\n</b>     ducks just in time.
