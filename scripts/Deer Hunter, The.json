PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY\n</b>\nThe plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley\nunder five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon\nacross the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through\nthe windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of\nguyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and\nchimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the\nclanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted\nby the falling snow.\n\nIn the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which\ninhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly\ndown the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad\nlooking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by\nthe skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow\nsidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched\nbetween the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the\nhillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run\nto three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of\ntoppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are\nall connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility\nlines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional\naid from a leaning pole.\n\nMUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as\nwe watch a car come charging up through the slush on\nColumbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the\nslippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,\nhuddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS\n<b>CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY\n</b><b>STREET.\n</b>\n<b>MAIN TITLE COMES UP:\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t  THE DEER HUNTER\n</b>\n<b>INT. STEEL MILL - DAY\n</b>\nA white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and\ncomes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and\nanother and another and another. The ingots are huge,\ntrembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying\nrumble.\n\n<b>CREDITS ROLL\n</b>\nUNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with\ntongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS\nwear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in\nheat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures\nin some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is\nhard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who\nare young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are\nNICK, SAL and MERLE.\n\nCREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise\nis deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on\nwith murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause\nMERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.\nSAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK\nmake the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,\ngives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE\nand NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts\nlaughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track\nagain and they all grab their tongs.\n\n<b>INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY\n</b>\nA very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding\nceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a\ncabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which\nwill be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing\nslowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of\nnerves.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tIt's all ready? Everything's ready?\n\n<b>\t\t\tPRIEST \n</b>\tYes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tAre you sure everything's ready?\n\tAre you positive?\n\n<b>\t\t\tPRIEST \n</b>\tEverything. Yes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tIt would snow... Everything's going\n\tto slip. Everything's going to\n\tslide... All the cars are going to\n\tcrash!\n\nSAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into\ntears.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI can't believe this... My own\n\tlittle boy... with a stranger!\n\nThe PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and\ncomforts her.\n\n<b>EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY\n</b>\nAnother car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides\nback. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses\nbursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin\nscampering across the street. They have all been working on\ntheir dresses, which are not completely finished, and they\nall carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As\nthey make their way to the other side of the street they all\nwave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One\nof the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone\nlaughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the\ngarment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS\ndisappear inside.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the\nlittle stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little\nhouses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides\nback. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group\nof OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a\nminiature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are\nall in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.\nThey begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,\nwith the great white cake held firmly between them.\n\n<b>INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY\n</b>\nThe time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle\nscreams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin\nchecking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front\nranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather\ntogether along the wall.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\tWhere's Vince?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL\n</b>\tThere's Albert! \n\t\t(calls)\n\tHey, Albert!!!\n\nALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --\nchanges course and plows across the river of homeward-bound\n<b>STEELWORKERS.\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT\n</b>\tHow you feelin', Sal?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL\n</b>\tI feel okay.\n\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT\n</b>\tFeeling hot?\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t(arm around SAL)\n\tHumper's ready.

Get Vince!\n\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT \n</b>\tI'll get him.\n\nALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs\nVINCE and they all push out together.\n\n<b>EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY\n</b>\nThe snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers\nthe acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As\nthe five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all\nstop dead in their tracks.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tSnow... Holy shit, snow!\n\nSAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE\nis so excited he begins hopping around.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t ... Do you know what this means?\n\tDo you guys realize exactly what\n\tthis means?\n\nThey all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK\nexchange looks. ALBERT chortles.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tWhat are you guys...? Are you guys\n\tgoing hunting?\n\nThe others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a\nlittle embarrassed.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tNot tonight?... You're not driving\n\tup tonight?\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tAs soon as you're hitched, Sal.\n\tFirst we get you hitched.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\t\t(envious)\n\tYou guys are crazy.

He makes a gesture with his hand.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\t\t(with a laugh)\n\tC'mon. C'mon you guys!\n\nThey all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm\naround SAL.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tAnd we want you to know, Sal, that\n\tany help you might need--\n\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT \n</b>\tYeah, Sal--\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tWilling fingers--\n\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT \n</b>\tExtra feet!\n\n<b>INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY\n</b>\nThe place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American\nflag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are\nlaying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side\na half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper\nribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,\ntwo more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under\nthe direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by\nside. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind\ncorrective lenses.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVET 1 \n</b>\tUp I would say... What would you\n\tsay?\n\n<b>\t\t\tVET 2 \n</b>\tUp.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVET 1 \n</b>\t\t(signals)\n\tUp ribbon!\n\nOne end of the ribbon is moved up.

What would you\n\tsay?\n\n<b>\t\t\tVET 1 \n</b>\tDown.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVET 2 \n</b>\t\t(signals)\n\tDown ribbon!\n\nSuddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up\nthe tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in\nwith the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and\nas they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus\nof Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN\ncollapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and\ngive her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in\none swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.\n\n<b>EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY\n</b>\nA big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,\ncoming fast.\n\n<b>INT. CADILLAC - DAY\n</b>\nNICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is\nat the wheel.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE\n</b>\tHit it, Nick!\n\n<b>\t\t\tOTHERS\n</b>\tGo Nick! Hit it, baby!!!\n\n<b>EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY\n</b>\nThe car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We\nwatch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three\nquarter mark...\n\n<b>INT. CADILLAC - DAY\n</b>\nNICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the\nslapping wipers.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGUYS IN THE CAR\n</b>\t\t(chanting)\n\tDo it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do\n\tit! Do it, Nick! Go!\n\nThe car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tBack! All hands to the rear!\n\nALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw\nthemselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGUYS IN BACK SEAT \n</b>\tEasy... 'At's it, easy! Easy,\n\tNick... Easy!\n\n<b>EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY\n</b>\nThe Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground\nand skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.\n\n<b>INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is\nplump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.\nANGELA leans forward into a mirror.\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA\n</b>\t\t(sincerely)\n\tI do.\n\nA pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(heartfelt)\n\tI do.\n\nANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI do, I do, I do!!!\n\nANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and\nunrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself\non the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the\npillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it\nout she sees that something is written on the back:\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(reading, slow)\n\t\"This is it -- more or less...\n\tLove, Mom.\"\n\nANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of\nMichaelangelo's \"David\". ANGELA stares at the figure for a\nlong, long moment...\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n</b>\tOh, wow.\n\n<b>INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n</b>\nThe place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking\nboilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the\nbar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals\ndepict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once\ncomical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret\nfrom the hunters, some power beyond their own.\n\nJOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At\nthe same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and\nVINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his\ntray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around\nthe floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert\ntheir places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting\ncongratulations.\n\n<b>INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\nLINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly\nlovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone\nin the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are\ncoming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.\nThere is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were\nbeing thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there\nis more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...\nand then silence.\n\nLINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew\ninto a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it\nall on a tray.\n\n<b>INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned\nover, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the\nwall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is\nLINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he\nholds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through\nthe open window, snow is blowing in.\n\nLINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment\nexpressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the\ntray on the bureau and kneels beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tDaddy?\n\n<b>\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\t(mumbles)\n\tGo... fucking hell!\n\nLINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and\nrolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes\nup is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles\nfrom his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it\nseaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins\ncursing again.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFATHER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tFucking shit... all around, like a\n\tsea! Like an ocean!\n\nLINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets\ndown on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the\nbed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by\nthe shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The\neffort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her\neyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father\ngroans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him\non the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in\nthe face and pushes her violently across the room.\n\nLINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into\nthe wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFATHER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tFucking bitch... All bitches!\n\nHe swings, catches her in the face again, hard.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA\n</b>\tDaddy...! Daddy, it's me!\n\n<b>\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\tHate 'em. Fucking bitches!\n\nLINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and\nfalls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her\njaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. \n\n<b>EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY\n</b>\nSeven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently\nthrough the falling snow.\n\n<b>EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n</b>\nThe WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging\nfrom grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield\nrolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive\n-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter\ncomes from inside.\n\n<b>INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n</b>\nNICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The\nMUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut\nwith a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF\nSCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley\nbursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The\nSTEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their\nheads in their hands and rush for the front door.\n\n<b>EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n</b>\nThe STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close\nbehind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of\ncomplaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get\ndressed for Sal's wedding.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The\nsnow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tBoy, this is it. This is really\n\tit... I mean... here I go.\n\nSAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tMy beautiful boy! My angel... who\n\tis leaving his own mother.\n\nShe throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tMomma...\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tSo cold is your heart to leave your\n\town mother?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tMomma, I'll be right upstairs.\n\nSAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with\nsympathy and study the snow flakes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tSo cruel is your heart?

NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n</b>\nThe trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which\nlooks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a\nconstruction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot\nwhich has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked\nschool bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare\nbranched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a\nlight shows from inside the trailer.\n\nCAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer\nwhistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and\ncarries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder\nblock steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the\ndoor and waves him in.\n\n<b>INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n</b>\nThe place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A\ndeer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half\ninto his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy\nboots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE\n</b>\t\t(indicates the\n\t\twaterproofing)\n\tYou should have put that on last\n\tnight.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tI know.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tThat way it sets.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tYeah.\n\nPause.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tI just wait.

It swirls over\neverything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.\n\nCAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping\nbags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken\ndoor. The wind gusts and moans.

RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY\n</b>\nAs the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot\nupward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the\nhillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two\nmiles wide.\n\n<b>EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n</b>\nA platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The\nbodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts\nspilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute\nsilence except for the low buzz of flies.\n\nA V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque\ncommand and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The\nLIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --\nidly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he\nrubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS\nlaugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.\n\nThere is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives\na low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.\nHe signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts\ntoward them.\n\n<b>INT. GRASS HUT - DAY\n</b>\nSouth Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old\nmen -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their\nhands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a\nlook of stark terror in their faces.\n\n<b>EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n</b>\nOne of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE\nSOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a\ngash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly\ngaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.\n\nA WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot\nrings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and\nstands there, on all fours, like a dog.\n\n<b>EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY\n</b>\nThe V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them\nin the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges\nfrom a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their\nfeet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a\nkick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The\nBABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY\ncomes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the\nend of his bayonet.\n\n<b>EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n</b>\nMERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams\na fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts\nfor the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,\nand his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the\ndead.\n\n<b>EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY\n</b>\nThe VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in\na line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up\nand down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies\nin the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to\nplay with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air\nsquats nearby and yawns.\n\n<b>EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY\n</b>\nMERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look\naround the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat\npackage and draws back.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming\nthings, glittering blankly.\n\n<b>EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY\n</b>\nMERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic.

And\nthen they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.\n\n<b>EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY\n</b>\nMERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of\nbillowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of\nheated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes\nare burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a\nblob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.\n\nIn front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two\ncharred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are\nmotionless now, like two roasted stones.\n\nAn AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the\nburning huts.

Hey, Merle!\n\nA shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the\nwhole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.\nGrenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for\ncover.\n\nOut of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more\nof them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.\n\n<b>EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n</b>\nWe are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug\nand fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by\nstones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits\nare filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo\ngratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings\nand their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan\nthere is only the sound of the falling rain.\n\nA V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the\npits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and\ndown on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as\none comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with\nlaughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls\ndown his pants and squats above the center grating.\n\nCAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its\ntotality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and\ncontains only two structures. One is a large bamboo \"tiger\ncage\" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small\nhut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and\nwe can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.\n\nA cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt\non flesh and the cry abruptly stops.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY\n</b>\nIn the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a\nrose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are\ntwo chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the\nchairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the\nhalf-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the\nmiddle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,\nis a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American\neagle carved on its ivory grip.\n\nMERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking\nin every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a\ndramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.\nImmediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS\nare a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,\nand it takes some time to straighten things out.\n\nMERLE looks off to his right:\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY\n</b>\nWe see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing\nagainst the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all\nhave their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,\nstanding beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks\ngrey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing\nquietly.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY\n</b>\nThe betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the\n.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder\ncontaining the single bullet, he points the revolver at the\nceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the\nrevolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down\nfrom the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and\ngrin.\n\nMERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table\nfrom him begins shaking uncontrollably.\n\nThe V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one\ncartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table\nbetween MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good\nspin.\n\nThe revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at\nMERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it\nup, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and\npulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with\na loud CLICK.\n\nMERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it\ntoward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to\ntremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get\nthe gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer\nand puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.\nThere is a loud CLICK.\n\nMERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all\nin one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the\ntrigger. There is another CLICK.\n\nMERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins\nthe cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on\nthe trigger.\n\n<b>THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE\n</b><b>MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN\n</b><b>TABLE.\n</b>\nMERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and\nlaughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and\nMERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...\nlike a cat.\n\n<b>EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY\n</b>\nA pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The\nbodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads\nare all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are\nalready feeding on them.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY\n</b>\nNICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He\nholds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is\ntwitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are\nholding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for\na long time.\n\nNICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS\nmurmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY\n</b>\nThere are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing\nhas stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes\nwander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.\nMERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to\nSAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the\nroom and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting\nchoice survives another round.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tYou can do it, Sal.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tNo. No, no.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tSal... listen to me, Sal!

Sal, do you\n\tunderstand?\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\t\t(nods)\n\tMerle, I wanna go home!\n\nThere is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S\neyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS\nopen a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and\nthe GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tListen to me, Sal. Do it! You have\n\tto do it!\n\nThe GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags\nhim of f to the table.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY\n</b>\nSAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed\nopposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger\nthan SAL, and he is trembling with terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tHey, listen, you can do it. \n\t\t(Sal nods, smiles)\n\tBelieve me, you can do it. We can\n\tboth do it. Then we go home, see?\n\tThen we go home!\n\nSAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle\ncomes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his\neyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then\nSAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,\ncocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS\n<b>TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES\n</b><b>HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.\n</b>\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN\n<b>EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.\n</b>\nSAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed\nin an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins\nto move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to\ndiscover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at\nthe place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.\n\n<b>INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY\n</b>\nA half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the\nmuck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,\nDEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the\nroof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the\nfloor.\n\nOn the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a\nfetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back\nand forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an\nexpression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at\nthe table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits\nslumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is\npicking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn\nat the knee.\n\n<b>MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND\n</b><b>LOOKING OUT AT THE \"PITS\".\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches\nhe sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.\n\n<b>SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY.

When they get to\ntheir feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the\ndirection of the \"pits\". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and\nclubs him down.\n\nSAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs\nhim down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins\ncomplaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to\nhelp the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on\none of the \"pits\".\n\nMERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tIt's up to you, Nick.

His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had\nmentally transported himself to some distant place. There are\ngreat gashes in his head from the blows he has received and\nas he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly\nlike a very small child who has experienced some terrible\nconfusion.\n\nSuddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.\n\nWe see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES\nfloating in the muck.\n\nWe SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn\naway.\n\nWe see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH\nas SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the\nbloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and\ntrying to find something solid to hod him up.\n\n<b>EXT.

NICK\nstruggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as\nthe GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE\nbegins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the\nrevolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE\n</b>\tHim and me!!!

The\nOTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are\nyelling and shouting.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE \n</b>\tYou guys think I'm in trouble,\n\tright?\n\nMERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tNo way!

Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the\nhammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty\nchamber.\n\nThe GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on\nNICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.\n\nMERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,\nhis brow furrowed in a mighty frown.\n\nNICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is\ntwitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if\nthrowing back a challenge.\n\nMERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an\nexpression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the\nrevolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no\nlonger possessed the strength to pick it up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(gloom)\n\tWho's for Merle?\n\t\t(he thumps his fist on the\n\t\ttable)\n\tIs anyone for Merle???\n\nMERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if\nsuddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he\npushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,\nstill in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body\nsag over it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWho here is for Merle...?\n\nThere is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the\nrain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The\nGUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by\nMERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little\nchildren.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWho... here... is for Merle...?\n\nMERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very\ndramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(with GUARDS)\n<b>\tMERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!\n</b><b>\tMERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!\n</b><b>\tMERLE IS MAGIC -- HA!\n</b>\nMERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the\nGUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same\ntime NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing\nbehind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.\nTWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO\nGUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with\nAK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,\nthey GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.\n\nIt is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled\nmess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --\nuninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...\n\n<b>EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n</b>\nBarely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow \nis a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step\nforward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.\n\n<b>INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY\n</b>\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK\nspins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and\nlets go with the AK 47.\n\n<b>EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n</b>\nMERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious\nand the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far\ncan be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.\nAs MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the\nside of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along\nbehind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.\n\nMERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the\nground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,\nSAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo\nwith an expression of pure terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tWhere are we going, Merle? Are we\n\tgoing home?\n\nThere is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.\nMERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his\nmouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.\n\nFor a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on\nand we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow\nrasps.\n\nThe sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS\nappear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is\nalmost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving\ndown the hill.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding\nand his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in\nhis skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he\nlooks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.\n\n<b>EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and\nshakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.\n\nMERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and\nslides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,\ntoo tired to move.\n\nSAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The\nrope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud\nand his eyes are huge with terror.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tMerle?\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE\n</b>\t\t(a whisper)\n\tRight here.\n\nSAL crouches down in the mud.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tWhere are we going, Merle?

In\nthe flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the\nmiddle of the road. There is another explosion and another\nflash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it\nappears miraculously unharmed.\n\nNICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside\nNICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only\none who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long\ntime, trying it out with one eye and then the other.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL \n</b>\tMerle?\n\nNo answer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMerle?\n\nStill no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.\nGetting no response he crosses fearfully toward the\nautomobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches\nout and touches it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tMerle. Merle, a car!\n\nAs the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the\ntires and begins kicking them.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHey! Hey, gee!\n\nSAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage\nwhatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL\npulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,\nhits the starter...\n\n<b>THERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR\n</b><b>GOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

God damn it!!!\n\nMERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh\nbut his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.\n\n<b>\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tSal!\n\t\t(more gently)\n\tSal...

CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY\n</b>\nREFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,\nfrightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of\nconveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the\nvast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing\non foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the\nroad and the great human tide streams around it, as if it\nwere an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine\ngun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters\nclatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the\nskids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting\nthe REFUGEES into the ditch.\n\nMERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.\nNICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh\nbandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a\njeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGENERAL\n</b>\tWhere's your unit, soldier?\n\nMERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without\ncomprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a\nslight shrug.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGENERAL \n</b>\t\t(to his DRIVER)\n\tC'mon. We'll take him along.\n\nThe GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the\nembankment toward MERLE.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGENERAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\tLittle R and R and you'll be\n\tstanding tall again, son... Damn,\n\tthis is steep!\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER \n</b>\tUh-oh. Sir.\n\nThe GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl\nhandled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible\nclick.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGENERAL \n</b>\tUh-oh.\n\nThe GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the\nembankment and pile in the jeep.\n\n<b>\t\t\tGENERAL (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(as they take off)\n\tY'know, there's more fucking\n\tmaniacs coming out of this\n\tconflict...\n\nMERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below\nthe REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the\nthousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE\nwatches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.\n\n<b>EXT.

The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek\nand whine...\n\nNICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers\ndown at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him\nof something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a\nPHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,\nthen closes his wallet and puts it away.\n\n<b>INT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY\n</b>\nBanks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the\ntelephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to\ncall home.

It is\nnot SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n</b>\tSorry... Thought you were someone\n\telse.\n\nThe SOLDIER continues on his way.

The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching\nwith another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building\nand there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated\nat a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it\ntight.

NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN\n</b>\nThe banner stretching to the house across the street has been\nwhipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside\nNICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same\nvintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are\nentirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a\nmoment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the\ntrailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,\nand then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS\nshe has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start\noff, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.\nThe STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up\ncar, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing\nout is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses\nare rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the\nSECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back\ninside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.\nThe GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her\nmissing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.\nShe returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe\nand they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave\nthere is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and\nJOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half\nundressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with\ncoffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes\noff. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at\nJOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in\nthe car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes\nto the street.

SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by\nthe window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie\nglow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny\none, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to\nanother.\n\nThere is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in\nwith NICK.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tI know I know you.

NICK\ncomes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and\nstands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the\npiece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tAngela...?\n\nANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding\nNICK's eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA \n</b>\tDid you ever think life would turn\n\tout like this?\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK \n</b>\tNo.\n\n<b>\t\t\tANGELA \n</b>\tYou know what Sal's got now?...\n\tSal's got... one arm, Nick, and...\n\tthat's it.\n\nThe door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in\nwith an electric toaster and a screwdriver.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n</b>\tHere.

It is snowing and from inside the church\nwe hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and\ndark, like a great river rolling through the night.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears\nglistening in his eyes.\n\n<b>EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n</b>\nWe see a lone telephone booth at the curb.

Some kind of\n\trendezvous.\n\nLINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at\nherself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She\nstrikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and\npoking a finger in her mouth.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n</b>\tDo you know what I mean?... Nick?\n\nNICK doesn't answer.

LINDA lets out a little moan and sits\ndown on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,\nshe stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off\nhis shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his\nshirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a\nfresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she\nslowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.\n\n<b>NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH\n</b><b>SCARS.

When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they\nsignal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.\n\nCAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace\nwhich is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze\nof cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.\n\nALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises\nthe door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,\nstanding like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances\ntoward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of\nhis asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have\nstuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace\nnow, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it\nthrough the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is\na white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a\ngeyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the\ndoorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and\nshowering him in a great cascade of white sparks.\n\n<b>INT.

I mean,\n\tif I'd'a been where you guys were --\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN \n</b>\tPsst. Vince!\n\nJOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has\ncome out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and\npeers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,\nwhich immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the\nchamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is\nhooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot\nricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.\nAs they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and\nthen VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.\n\n<b>EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY\n</b>\nThe wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK\nappears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,\nlistening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.\nThe BUCK is behind him, bounding away.\n\n<b>EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY\n</b>\nThe BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching\na deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns\nsharp left and disappears.\n\nNICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going\nhard.\n\n<b>EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY\n</b>\nNICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs\nover. As he touches down on the other side there is a\ngrowling sound.\n\nNICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that\nhe has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the\ntop of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder\nbegins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and\nboulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...\nand then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to\nunknown depths below.\n\n<b>EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY\n</b>\nALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log\nbeside the shack.

Just... just like a\n\thot shit... except cold.\n\nJOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,\nthen cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are\nscattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT\nand JOHN stand up.\n\n<b>EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY\n</b>\nThe DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of\nthe woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE\ncomes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.\nVINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one\nshoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and\nperceptibly bent.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tI got this one!!! This one's\n\tmine!!!\n\nVINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head\nover heels.\n\n<b>EXT. DITCH - DAY\n</b>\nVINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises\nhis rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin\ncoming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The\nDEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the\nDEER, draws his pistol...\n\n<b>EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n</b>\nCars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are\nsitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming\nthemselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the\nembankment.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tI got this one!!! This one's\n\tmine!!!\n\nThe panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked\ncars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN\nTHE CARS dive for cover.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tHold your fire! I got this one!!!\n\nVINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.\nHUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes\nout, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets\nup. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The\nDEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.\nVINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI got it!

BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY\n</b>\nALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the\nwoods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.\n\nThe DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.\nVINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is\na DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tGun! Gimme gun!!!\n\nALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a\ncartridge in the chamber.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(looks around, bewildered)\n\tWhere's it gone?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOHN \n</b>\tInside, Vince.\n\nVINCE staggers to the cabin door.

MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY\n</b>\nThe wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way\nand then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black\nspeck in the endless expanse of shifting white.\n\nAs NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His\nclothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow\ngasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK\nAPPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are\nno tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in\nthe driving snow.\n\nThe wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in\nagain from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the\nsilence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.\n\nNICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty\nfeet away, looking down at him.\n\nNICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights\ndown the barrel.\n\n<b>WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.\n</b><b>NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.\n</b>\n<b>NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE.

Go on, say it!!!\n\nNICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at\nthe pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun\nwith one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.\nNICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and\nbegins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches\nover, pulls NICK away.\n\n<b>\t\t\tALBERT \n</b>\tNick!

NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK\n</b>\nThe trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls\ninto the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK\ngets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK\ngoes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and\npounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb\nwith his load of THREE DEAD DEER.\n\nNICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.\n\n<b>INT. V.A.

Beyond the NURSE\nwe see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down\nthe polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize\nit is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the\nbottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and\ntrails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been\namputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly\nscarred and what expression he displays is centered in his\neyes.\n\nSAL takes the telephone.

NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n</b>\nNICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then\nputs the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks\naround in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye\nfalls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,\nhurries out the door.\n\n<b>EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping\ncarts which a CLERK is banging together.\n\nNICK gets out of his car and goes in.\n\n<b>INT.

STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the\nfrozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN\nappears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly\ndressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,\npolished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the\nlight of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.\n\n<b>THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY\n</b><b>SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.\n</b>\n<b>THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,\n</b><b>THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.\n</b>\n<b>INT.

A\nCHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.\nThe PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the\nMAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face\nis not visible.\n\nAs NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed.

The corners are tattered\nand it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket\nfor a long time.\n\nNICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and\nunfolds it.\n\n<b>THE CARD READS \"EXHIBITIONS\".

Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred\nyards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns\nwhich bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --\nwandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and\nstrolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are\nAMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are\nOFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed\namong them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from\nsports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to\nnationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,\nBELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and\nMISTRESSES abound.

Between them, lying on\nthe table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in\ntuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.\n\nAlthough the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam\nthe first three rows.

The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and\ntremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.\n\n<b>INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY\n</b>\nThe meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are\nsmoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter\nand conversation.\n\nNICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA\nand SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are\ntears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLINDA \n</b>\tEat something, Nick. Eat a piece of\n\ttoast.\n\nNICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all\nabout it, lays it absently on his plate.\n\nVINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a\nnew blue suit.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE \n</b>\tYou want to say a few words, Nick?\n\tI think you should. Like that would\n\twind things up.\n\nNICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tQuiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,\n\teverybody, Nick has a few words.\n\n<b>\t\t\tNICK\n</b>\t\t(very shaky)\n\tI just... would like to say a few\n\twords... about Merle. I guess Merle\n\talways wanted something... I don't\n\tknow... better. That fucking guy,\n\the saved my Life. He saved Sal's...\n\tWhat Merle liked, he liked things\n\tright... But then there wasn't any\n\tplace for that... that he could\n\tfind.\n\nTears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,\nlooking miserable.\n\n<b>\t\t\tVINCE\n</b>\t\t(hisses)\n\tJohn! Play something!\n\nJOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,\ncasts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing\n\"America The Beautiful\".\n\nA FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.\nThen EVERYONE stands up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t THE END\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Deer Hunter, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Deric Washburn\" title=\"Scripts by Deric Washburn\">Deric Washburn</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/War\" title=\"War Scripts\">War</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Deer Hunter, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Deer Hunter, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:03:33.471585"}
