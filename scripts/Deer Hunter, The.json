PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY\n\nThe plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley\nunder five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon\nacross the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through\nthe windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of\nguyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and\nchimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the\nclanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted\nby the falling snow.\n\nIn the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which\ninhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly\ndown the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad\nlooking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by\nthe skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow\nsidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched\nbetween the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the\nhillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run\nto three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of\ntoppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are\nall connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility\nlines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional\naid from a leaning pole.\n\nMUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as\nwe watch a car come charging up through the slush on\nColumbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the\nslippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,\nhuddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS\nCAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY\nSTREET.\n\nMAIN TITLE COMES UP:\n\n\t\t\t  THE DEER HUNTER\n\nINT. STEEL MILL - DAY\n\nA white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and\ncomes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and\nanother and another and another. The ingots are huge,\ntrembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying\nrumble.\n\nCREDITS ROLL\n\nUNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with\ntongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS\nwear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in\nheat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures\nin some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is\nhard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who\nare young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are\nNICK, SAL and MERLE.\n\nCREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise\nis deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on\nwith murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause\nMERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.\nSAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK\nmake the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,\ngives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE\nand NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts\nlaughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track\nagain and they all grab their tongs.\n\nINT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY\n\nA very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding\nceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a\ncabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which\nwill be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing\nslowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of\nnerves.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tIt's all ready? Everything's ready?\n\n\t\t\tPRIEST \n\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tAre you sure everything's ready?\n\tAre you positive?\n\n\t\t\tPRIEST \n\tEverything. Yes.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tIt would snow... Everything's going\n\tto slip. Everything's going to\n\tslide... All the cars are going to\n\tcrash!\n\nSAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into\ntears.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)\n\tI can't believe this... My own\n\tlittle boy... with a stranger!\n\nThe PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and\ncomforts her.\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY\n\nAnother car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides\nback. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses\nbursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin\nscampering across the street. They have all been working on\ntheir dresses, which are not completely finished, and they\nall carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As\nthey make their way to the other side of the street they all\nwave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One\nof the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone\nlaughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the\ngarment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS\ndisappear inside.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the\nlittle stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little\nhouses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides\nback. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group\nof OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a\nminiature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are\nall in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.\nThey begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,\nwith the great white cake held firmly between them.\n\nINT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY\n\nThe time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle\nscreams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin\nchecking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front\nranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather\ntogether along the wall.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tWhere's Vince?\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tThere's Albert! \n\t\t(calls)\n\tHey, Albert!!!\n\nALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --\nchanges course and plows across the river of homeward-bound\nSTEELWORKERS.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tHow you feelin', Sal?\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tI feel okay.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tFeeling hot?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(arm around SAL)\n\tHumper's ready. Old humper's\n\thotter'n damn hell!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tThere's Vince!\n\n\t\t\tOTHERS\n\t\t(calling)\n\tVince!... Over here! Vince!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tGet him, Albert. Get Vince!\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tI'll get him.\n\nALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs\nVINCE and they all push out together.\n\nEXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nThe snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers\nthe acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As\nthe five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all\nstop dead in their tracks.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tSnow... Holy shit, snow!\n\nSAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE\nis so excited he begins hopping around.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\t ... Do you know what this means?\n\tDo you guys realize exactly what\n\tthis means?\n\nThey all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK\nexchange looks. ALBERT chortles.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tWhat are you guys...? Are you guys\n\tgoing hunting?\n\nThe others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a\nlittle embarrassed.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n\tNot tonight?... You're not driving\n\tup tonight?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tAs soon as you're hitched, Sal.\n\tFirst we get you hitched.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\t\t(envious)\n\tYou guys are crazy. You know that?\n\tI mean you guys are really nuts.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tHe's getting married... and we're\n\tnuts!\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(puts his arm around SAL)\n\tIt's all right. Hey, it's all\n\tright. We'll be right here, right\n\twith you.\n\nA look at the others...\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tWon't we? Right? Am I right?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tRight.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tDamn right!\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tWhat do you think, Sal? Jesus, you\n\tthink we'd miss this?\n\nNow SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(with a laugh)\n\tC'mon. C'mon you guys!\n\nThey all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm\naround SAL.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tAnd we want you to know, Sal, that\n\tany help you might need--\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tYeah, Sal--\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tWilling fingers--\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tExtra feet!\n\nINT. V.F.W. POST - DAY\n\nThe place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American\nflag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are\nlaying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side\na half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper\nribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,\ntwo more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under\nthe direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by\nside. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind\ncorrective lenses.\n\n\t\t\tVET 1 \n\tUp I would say... What would you\n\tsay?\n\n\t\t\tVET 2 \n\tUp.\n\n\t\t\tVET 1 \n\t\t(signals)\n\tUp ribbon!\n\nOne end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it.\n\n\t\t\tVET 2 \n\tDown I would say... What would you\n\tsay?\n\n\t\t\tVET 1 \n\tDown.\n\n\t\t\tVET 2 \n\t\t(signals)\n\tDown ribbon!\n\nSuddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up\nthe tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in\nwith the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and\nas they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus\nof Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN\ncollapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and\ngive her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in\none swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY\n\nA big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,\ncoming fast.\n\nINT. CADILLAC - DAY\n\nNICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is\nat the wheel.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\tHit it, Nick!\n\n\t\t\tOTHERS\n\tGo Nick! Hit it, baby!!!\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY\n\nThe car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We\nwatch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three\nquarter mark...\n\nINT. CADILLAC - DAY\n\nNICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the\nslapping wipers.\n\n\t\t\tGUYS IN THE CAR\n\t\t(chanting)\n\tDo it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do\n\tit! Do it, Nick! Go!\n\nThe car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tBack! All hands to the rear!\n\nALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw\nthemselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.\n\n\t\t\tGUYS IN BACK SEAT \n\tEasy... 'At's it, easy! Easy,\n\tNick... Easy!\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY\n\nThe Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground\nand skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.\n\nINT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY\n\nANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is\nplump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.\nANGELA leans forward into a mirror.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA\n\t\t(sincerely)\n\tI do.\n\nA pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n\t\t(heartfelt)\n\tI do.\n\nANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n\tI do, I do, I do!!!\n\nANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and\nunrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself\non the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the\npillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it\nout she sees that something is written on the back:\n\n\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n\t\t(reading, slow)\n\t\"This is it -- more or less...\n\tLove, Mom.\"\n\nANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of\nMichaelangelo's \"David\". ANGELA stares at the figure for a\nlong, long moment...\n\n\t\t\tANGELA (CONT'D)\n\tOh, wow.\n\nINT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n\nThe place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking\nboilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the\nbar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals\ndepict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once\ncomical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret\nfrom the hunters, some power beyond their own.\n\nJOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At\nthe same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and\nVINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his\ntray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around\nthe floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert\ntheir places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting\ncongratulations.\n\nINT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY\n\nLINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly\nlovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone\nin the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are\ncoming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.\nThere is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were\nbeing thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there\nis more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...\nand then silence.\n\nLINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew\ninto a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it\nall on a tray.\n\nINT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\nThe room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned\nover, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the\nwall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is\nLINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he\nholds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through\nthe open window, snow is blowing in.\n\nLINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment\nexpressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the\ntray on the bureau and kneels beside him.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tDaddy?\n\n\t\t\tFATHER\n\t\t(mumbles)\n\tGo... fucking hell!\n\nLINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and\nrolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes\nup is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles\nfrom his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it\nseaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins\ncursing again.\n\n\t\t\tFATHER (CONT'D)\n\tFucking shit... all around, like a\n\tsea! Like an ocean!\n\nLINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets\ndown on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the\nbed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by\nthe shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The\neffort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her\neyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father\ngroans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him\non the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in\nthe face and pushes her violently across the room.\n\nLINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into\nthe wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.\n\n\t\t\tFATHER (CONT'D)\n\tFucking bitch... All bitches!\n\nHe swings, catches her in the face again, hard.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tDaddy...! Daddy, it's me!\n\n\t\t\tFATHER\n\tHate 'em. Fucking bitches!\n\nLINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and\nfalls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her\njaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. \n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY\n\nSeven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently\nthrough the falling snow.\n\nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n\nThe WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging\nfrom grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield\nrolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive\n-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter\ncomes from inside.\n\nINT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY\n\nNICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The\nMUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut\nwith a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF\nSCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley\nbursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The\nSTEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their\nheads in their hands and rush for the front door.\n\nEXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nThe STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close\nbehind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of\ncomplaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get\ndressed for Sal's wedding.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The\nsnow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tBoy, this is it. This is really\n\tit... I mean... here I go.\n\nSAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tMy beautiful boy! My angel... who\n\tis leaving his own mother.\n\nShe throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMomma...\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tSo cold is your heart to leave your\n\town mother?\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMomma, I'll be right upstairs.\n\nSAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with\nsympathy and study the snow flakes.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tSo cruel is your heart? Is your\n\theart so uncaring?\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\t\t(a litany now)\n\tOne flight, Momma. It's one flight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n\nThe trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which\nlooks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a\nconstruction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot\nwhich has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked\nschool bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare\nbranched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a\nlight shows from inside the trailer.\n\nCAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer\nwhistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and\ncarries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder\nblock steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the\ndoor and waves him in.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n\nThe place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A\ndeer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half\ninto his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy\nboots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(indicates the\n\t\twaterproofing)\n\tYou should have put that on last\n\tnight.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI know.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tThat way it sets.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah.\n\nPause.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI just wait. You know?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI just wait. For this... It's what\n\tI wait for... I wait all year.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tSo do I.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(sharp)\n\tYou do?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(nods)\n\tYeah.\n\nNICK grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil\noff it.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYou think about it?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tSo do I.\n\t\t(watches Nick for a\n\t\tminute)\n\tI want to be ready... You have to\n\tbe ready... It has to be there, in\n\tyour mind.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tThe shot?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tFucking A.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tI don't think about the shot that\n\tmuch.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(firmly)\n\tYou have to think about the shot.\n\tIt's the shot. The shot's it.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(uncertain)\n\tYeah... I guess.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(studies him)\n\tWhat do you think about?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI don't know... I guess I think\n\tabout the deer... Being out, maybe.\n\tI don't know. I think about it all.\n\tHell, I like the trees, you know? I\n\tlike the ways the trees are, all\n\tthe different ways the trees are\n\ttoo.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(with a glance to the\n\t\twindow)\n\tI'll tell you something, Nick. I\n\twouldn't hunt with anyone but you.\n\tI won't hunt with a yo-yo.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(laughs)\n\tYo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tWho's a yo-yo...? Who do you\n\tthink's a yo-yo! They're all yo\n\tyo's. I mean they're all great\n\tguys, for Christ's sake, but... The\n\tpoint is, Nick, without you I'd\n\thunt alone. Seriously. I would.\n\tThat's what I'd do.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(laughs)\n\tYou're a fucking nut. You know\n\tthat, Merle? You're a fucking\n\tmaniac!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYeah.\n\t\t(he grins)\n\tWhen it comes to hunting, that's\n\ttrue.\n\nCursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN\nand ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are\npounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open.\nNICK and MERLE go out. \n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tAlbert! For Christ's sake... John!\n\tWait a minute, you guys!\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tIt won't open.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYou gotta hit it here.

Hit it here.\n\nALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps\nopen.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tHey, that's neat.\n\nNICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT (CONT'D)\n\tThat's new, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tCouple of weeks... Listen --\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tI love this car. Some cars sit, you\n\tknow? This car, a car like this...\n\tgrows. I mean you never know, with\n\ta car like this, where this car has\n\tbeen.\n\nVINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally\ndisorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tHey, guys...\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tShhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup\n\tde Ville.\n\nALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end\nof the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest,\nthumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,\nmile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the\nchurch bell begins ringing down the street and a group of\nexcited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 1\n\tAlbert, what are you doing!\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 2\n\tHurry up, you guys!\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 3\n\tWho's got their carnations?\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 4\n\tHere.

You're all a mess!\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 3\n\tPut on their carnations!\n\n\t\t\tBRIDESMAID 1 \n\tWho's got a pin?\n\nAs the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on\ncarnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to\nfind LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be\nseen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a\nsmall suitcase in her hand.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(crosses)\n\tLinda...\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tHi.\n\t\t(forces a smile)\n\tNick, your shoes are soaking.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tLinda, what's the matter?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t(tries to toss it off)\n\tOh... You know...\n\nShe fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks\naround, pulls her inside the trailer.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY\n\nNICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her\nsuitcase in her lap.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t(with great effort)\n\tI was just wondering... Nick...\n\tYou're going hunting...

MERLE's knapsack\nlies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it\ncontains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tSure I got boots. I got boots right\n\there.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tThen lemme have 'em.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\t\t(both hands in the air)\n\tNo!!!?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tWhat do you mean, no???\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tThat's it. No. No way.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tSome fuckin' friend... You're some\n\tfuckin' friend, Merle!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYou gotta learn, Vince! You come\n\tout here... You got no jacket, you\n\tgot no pants, you got no knife and\n\tyou got no boots. You think\n\teveryone's gonna take care of you!\n\tThat's what you always think, but\n\tthis time you're wrong. This time\n\tyou're on your own!\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tMerle, give him the boots.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tNo. No boots. No nothin'.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tYou're one fuckin' bastard, Merle.\n\tYou know that? You're one fucking\n\tbastard!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(snapping it out, jabbing\n\t\this finger at the ground)\n\tThis is this, Vince. This isn't\n\tsomething else. This is this!\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tYou know what I think? There's\n\ttimes I think you're a goddamn\n\tfaggot!... I fixed you up a million\n\ttimes, Merle!\n\t\t(to the others)\n\tI fixed him up a million times! I\n\tdon't know how many times I fixed\n\thim up... and nothin' ever\n\thappens... Zilch! Zero!... The\n\ttrouble with you, Merle, no one\n\tknows what you're talking about!\n\t\"This is this\"? What does that\n\tmean, \"this is this\"? I mean is\n\tthat some faggot bullshit, or is\n\tthat some faggot bullshit!!! And if\n\tit isn't, what the hell is it???\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tVince. Hey, you guys --\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t(hopping now)\n\tTake last night...! Last night he\n\tcoulda had twenty fuckin' deer!\n\tMore! He coulda had more! And look\n\twhat he does! I mean look what he\n\tfuckin' does!!!\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tVince!!!\n\nJOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN (CONT'D)\n\tI'll get the boots.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t(in agreement)\n\tGet the boots.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\t\t(crossing to Merle's\n\t\tknapsack)\n\tI mean let's get going before --\n\nMERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's\ntirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN\nfreezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tI said no.\n\nJOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both\nback away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,\nbegins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes\nopen again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his\npants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.\nHe looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the\nboots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(gently, to Merle)\n\tLet's hunt.\n\nINT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT\n\nThe place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,\nboards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is\ncanted to the right. Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing\nColeman lantern which sways in the wind.\n\nVINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are sacked out, sound asleep. Beer\ncans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. Wet clothes,\nmost of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strung\nup on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a\nknife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.\nSnow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls over\neverything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.\n\nCAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping\nbags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken\ndoor. The wind gusts and moans. The cabin shudders and then\nthere is a sudden lull.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tHey, Nick?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tTomorrow I go with Vince.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tHunt with Vince?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tYeah... I mean so he knows... He\n\tdoesn't even know.\n\nEXT. THRUWAY PITTSBURGH OFF-RAMP - TWILIGHT\n\nTraffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of\nheadlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems\nto float in thin air. Behind is the mill, belching steam and\nablaze with fire.\n\nNICK's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the\ntraffic. The car sits low. Trussed to the hood, to the roof,\nto the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. Rope-ends\nflutter and bang in the wind. The car shudders and thuds.\nInside, grinning maniacally, NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and\nJOHN are all shouting and guzzling beer.\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TWILIGHT\n\nThe Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires\nscreaming and NICK still leaning on the horn. The guys are\nall hanging out the windows, shouting to FRIENDS, whistling\nat GIRLS and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tMaxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tHey Geraldine, let's eat!\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\tNothin' to it, asshole! Piece o'\n\tfuckin' cake!\n\nAs the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,\nseeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze\nwhite, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer\non the fenders glitter gold and green and red.\n\nALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call... IT\nSEEMS TO ECHO, AS IF COMING FROM FAR AWAY,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFREEZE FRAME...\n\nEXT. CLOSE-UP OF JUNGLE LEAF - DAY\n\nThe leaf is being eaten by an exotic-looking insect. After\neach bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly\nthoughtful expression, and chews.\n\nWE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL,\nFLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER...\n\nEXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY\n\nThere are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the\ntops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and\nmurderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat\nclusters, like eggs.\n\nSuddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets.\n\nEXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY\n\nAs the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot\nupward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the\nhillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two\nmiles wide.\n\nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n\nA platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The\nbodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts\nspilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute\nsilence except for the low buzz of flies.\n\nA V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque\ncommand and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The\nLIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --\nidly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he\nrubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS\nlaugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.\n\nThere is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives\na low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.\nHe signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts\ntoward them.\n\nINT. GRASS HUT - DAY\n\nSouth Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old\nmen -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their\nhands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a\nlook of stark terror in their faces.\n\nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n\nOne of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE\nSOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a\ngash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly\ngaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.\n\nA WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot\nrings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and\nstands there, on all fours, like a dog.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY\n\nThe V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them\nin the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges\nfrom a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their\nfeet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a\nkick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The\nBABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY\ncomes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the\nend of his bayonet.\n\nEXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY\n\nMERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams\na fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts\nfor the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,\nand his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the\ndead.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS DAY\n\nThe VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in\na line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up\nand down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies\nin the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to\nplay with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air\nsquats nearby and yawns.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY\n\nMERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look\naround the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat\npackage and draws back.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming\nthings, glittering blankly.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY\n\nMERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.\nSOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a\nthin mist of spraying blood.\n\nABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.\n\nEXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY\n\nThere are five of them, coming in low under the tops of\nnearby trees.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY\n\nThe VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters\nand frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And\nthen they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.\n\nEXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY\n\nMERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of\nbillowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of\nheated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes\nare burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a\nblob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.\n\nIn front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two\ncharred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are\nmotionless now, like two roasted stones.\n\nAn AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the\nburning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and\nthen the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.\n\n\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\tWhat the hell are you doing here?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(numb)\n\tSaving lives.\n\nMORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the\ntrees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.\n\n\t\t\tLIEUTENANT\n\tMove it out, girls! Move it out!\n\nThe LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tMerle?... Jesus, Merle!\n\nMERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He\nseems to be looking right through him.\n\nSAL comes up behind NICK.\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tHey...! Hey, Merle!\n\nA shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the\nwhole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.\nGrenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for\ncover.\n\nOut of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more\nof them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nWe are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug\nand fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by\nstones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits\nare filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo\ngratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings\nand their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan\nthere is only the sound of the falling rain.\n\nA V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the\npits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and\ndown on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as\none comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with\nlaughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls\ndown his pants and squats above the center grating.\n\nCAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its\ntotality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and\ncontains only two structures. One is a large bamboo \"tiger\ncage\" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small\nhut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and\nwe can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.\n\nA cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt\non flesh and the cry abruptly stops.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - DAY\n\nIn the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a\nrose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are\ntwo chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the\nchairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the\nhalf-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the\nmiddle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,\nis a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American\neagle carved on its ivory grip.\n\nMERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking\nin every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a\ndramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.\nImmediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS\nare a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,\nand it takes some time to straighten things out.\n\nMERLE looks off to his right:\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY\n\nWe see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing\nagainst the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all\nhave their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,\nstanding beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks\ngrey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing\nquietly.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY\n\nThe betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the\n.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder\ncontaining the single bullet, he points the revolver at the\nceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the\nrevolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down\nfrom the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and\ngrin.\n\nMERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table\nfrom him begins shaking uncontrollably.\n\nThe V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one\ncartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table\nbetween MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good\nspin.\n\nThe revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at\nMERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it\nup, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and\npulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with\na loud CLICK.\n\nMERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it\ntoward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to\ntremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get\nthe gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer\nand puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.\nThere is a loud CLICK.\n\nMERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all\nin one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the\ntrigger. There is another CLICK.\n\nMERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins\nthe cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on\nthe trigger.\n\nTHERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE\nMAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN\nTABLE.\n\nMERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and\nlaughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and\nMERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...\nlike a cat.\n\nEXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY\n\nA pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The\nbodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads\nare all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are\nalready feeding on them.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY\n\nNICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He\nholds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is\ntwitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are\nholding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for\na long time.\n\nNICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS\nmurmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY\n\nThere are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing\nhas stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes\nwander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.\nMERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to\nSAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the\nroom and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting\nchoice survives another round.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYou can do it, Sal.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tNo. No, no.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tSal... listen to me, Sal! You have\n\tto do it.\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tI want to go home, Merle.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYou have to think about this, Sal.\n\tListen to me, Sal! You have to\n\tthink about this.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\t\t(tears again)\n\tThis is horrible!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tListen to me, Sal. If you don't do\n\tit they'll put you in the pit. If\n\tthey put you in the pit, Sal,\n\tyou're gonna die... Sal, do you\n\tunderstand?\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\t\t(nods)\n\tMerle, I wanna go home!\n\nThere is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S\neyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS\nopen a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and\nthe GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tListen to me, Sal. Do it! You have\n\tto do it!\n\nThe GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags\nhim of f to the table.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY\n\nSAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed\nopposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger\nthan SAL, and he is trembling with terror.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tHey, listen, you can do it. \n\t\t(Sal nods, smiles)\n\tBelieve me, you can do it. We can\n\tboth do it. Then we go home, see?\n\tThen we go home!\n\nSAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle\ncomes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his\neyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then\nSAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,\ncocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the\nSOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS\nTAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES\nHIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.\n\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN\nEXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.\n\nSAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed\nin an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins\nto move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to\ndiscover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at\nthe place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.\n\nINT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY\n\nA half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the\nmuck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,\nDEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the\nroof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the\nfloor.\n\nOn the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a\nfetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back\nand forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an\nexpression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at\nthe table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits\nslumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is\npicking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn\nat the knee.\n\nMERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND\nLOOKING OUT AT THE \"PITS\".\n\nEXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nThe pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water\ngurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the\ndownhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far\nfewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches\nhe sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.\n\nSUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR\nA MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.\n\nINT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nMERLE turns away from the \"pits\". He looks down at SAL, then\nhe looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as\nif he had been having a long argument.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI'm telling you, Nick, no one's\n\tgoing to come.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhat are you, God?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tListen, asshole, it's up to us!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tThey bombed last night, right?\n\tDidn't they bomb? If they bombed\n\tlast night, they could bomb\n\ttonight. They could be up there\n\tright now!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tWhat are you, hoping?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhat else?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI thought you might be praying.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI'm doing that too.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI suppose you wish you were\n\tsomewhere else?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tNick, you're wasting your time...\n\tListen to me! You're wasting your\n\ttime! This is no fucking time for\n\thoping or praying or wishing or any\n\tother shit! This is it. Here we\n\tare... And we gotta get out!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYou're right... Okay, you're right.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(grabs him)\n\tGet off your ass, Nick. Get off\n\tyour fucking ass and stand up!!!\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(stands)\n\tOkay, okay!\n\t\t(he straightens his\n\t\tshoulders)\n\tOkay. Okay, you're right... What\n\tabout Sal?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tForget Sal.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tI mean forget Sal... Sal can't take\n\tit, Nick.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tForget Sal?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tForget Sal... Listen to me --\n\tforget Sal! I've been working on\n\tSal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a\n\tdream and he won't come out.\n\tLISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go\n\tfor you. You hear me? For you!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tMerle...\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tLISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR\n\tHEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD\n\tTOO!\n\nA shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE\nwhip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.\n\nThrough the bars of the \"tiger cage\" we see the V.C. GUARDS\ncoming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all\ndrinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the\npearl-handled revolver.\n\nNICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(calm)\n\tWe gotta play with more bullets.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWe what?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tWe gotta play with more bullets,\n\tNick. It's the only way.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tMore bullets in the gun?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(even)\n\tMore bullets in the gun... The\n\ttrouble is that still leaves one of\n\tus with his hands tied up, so that\n\tmeans we gotta play each other.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(numb)\n\tWith more bullets?... Against each\n\tother?... Are you crazy!!! Are you\n\tfucking nuts!!!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tNick... NICK!!! It's the only\n\tchance we've got!\n\nNICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets\nand the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHow many bullets?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(watching him)\n\tThree bullets -- minimum.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(panic)\n\tNo way. No fucking way!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(evenly, holding him with\n\t\this eyes)\n\tI'll pick the moment, Nick. The\n\tgame goes on until I move. When I\n\tstart shooting, go for the nearest\n\tguard and get his gun.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo. No way!\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tWhen you get the AK, open up. You\n\tgot me? Open up.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(screaming)\n\tYOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW\n\tYOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY\n\tCRAZY!!!\n\nThe GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and\nONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which\nshreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK\nand MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nAs the PRISONERS emerge from the \"tiger cage\" the GUARDS\nsmash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the\nmelee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are\nknocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to\ntheir feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the\ndirection of the \"pits\". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and\nclubs him down.\n\nSAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs\nhim down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins\ncomplaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to\nhelp the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on\none of the \"pits\".\n\nMERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tIt's up to you, Nick. Now it's up\n\tto you.\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - THE \"PITS\" - DAY\n\nSAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to\nhappen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had\nmentally transported himself to some distant place. There are\ngreat gashes in his head from the blows he has received and\nas he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly\nlike a very small child who has experienced some terrible\nconfusion.\n\nSuddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.\n\nWe see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES\nfloating in the muck.\n\nWe SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn\naway.\n\nWe see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH\nas SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the\nbloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and\ntrying to find something solid to hod him up.\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - WAITING PRISONERS - DAY\n\nNICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS.\nMERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and\nwhen he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the\nstomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK\nstruggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as\nthe GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE\nbegins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the\nrevolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tHim and me!!! Him and me!!!\n\nThe GUARDS look at each other, interested.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tHim and me, goddamn it! Him and me!\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nMERLE and NICK sit facing one another across the rose\npatterned kitchen table. The GUARDS are all grinning and even\nthe SOUTH VIETNAMESE are watching with grim fascination. NICK\nhas the revolver. He is trembling visibly. Already MERLE has\nmanaged to draw the GUARDS in closer and as NICK spins the\ncylinder and cocks the hammer MERLE jumps up and begins\npounding on the table.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tThis is it, motherfuckers! Now he's\n\tgoing to do it! Watch! You watch!\n\nNICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand\nbegins shaking violently.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tLook at him! See! This is it and he\n\tknows it!\n\nSide bets begin changing hands.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tLast chance to lose your money\n\tthere, guys. Goodbye money! Hurry,\n\thurry. Here he goes!\n\nNICK puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the\ntrigger. There is a dull CLICK.\n\nNICK puts the revolver back on the table. His hand is shaking\nso badly it falls with a clunk. MERLE grabs it, spins it,\nsticks it to his temple and CLICKS OUT, talking all the time:\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tThis is stupid! You understand\n\tstupid? On and on! At this rate\n\twe'll still be here tomorrow!\n\t\t(throws the revolver on\n\t\tthe table)\n\tWait a minute. I know! Hey, I got\n\tit. More! Put in more! You\n\tunderstand more? More! More\n\tbullets!\n\t\t(he mimes with his\n\t\tfingers)\n\tThree bullets! You understand\n\tthree? That way BLAM! BOOM!\n\nMERLE hops up and down, laughing maniacally.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tKA-POWIE!!! BA-ROOM!!!... 'Cause I\n\twant that bastard! Him I want boom!\n\tHim or me!!!\n\nThe GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin\nshouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his\nlips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and\nthen nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right\nin.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tHe's terrific! Great fucking guy!\n\nThe GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder\nand begins sticking in two more cartridges.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tKA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!!\n\nMERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing\nhis finger at him, as if in fury.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tBoth of us may have to pull on\n\tthis, so get your shit in fuckin'\n\tshape!!!\n\t\t(to the GUARDS)\n\tHim or me!!! Now we got it, him or\n\tme!!!\n\t\t(he rubs his hands and\n\t\tsits back down)\n\tPlace your bets, motherfuckers! Now\n\twe're going! Now we got a game!\n\nThe GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins\nit.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tWatch! Now watch! He's going to get\n\tit. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!!\n\nThe muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over\nat the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the\nbarrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The\nOTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are\nyelling and shouting.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tYou guys think I'm in trouble,\n\tright?\n\nMERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tNo way! Never!!!\n\t\t(he begins to chant)\n\tMERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!\n\tMERLE LIVES LONG!\n\tLemme hear it. Come on,\n\tmotherfuckers, lemme hear it!\n\nMERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him\nJOIN IN:\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(with GUARDS)\n\tMERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!\n\tMERLE LIVES LONG!\n\nMERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD\nIN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution.\n\nMERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an\nempty chamber.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tSee! Nothing to it.\n\nHe pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at\nhim, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tYou got an empty chamber and it's\n\tin your mind! Just put that empty\n\tchamber in the gun!\n\nNICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at\nMERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the\nhammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty\nchamber.\n\nThe GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on\nNICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.\n\nMERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,\nhis brow furrowed in a mighty frown.\n\nNICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is\ntwitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if\nthrowing back a challenge.\n\nMERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an\nexpression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the\nrevolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no\nlonger possessed the strength to pick it up.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(gloom)\n\tWho's for Merle?\n\t\t(he thumps his fist on the\n\t\ttable)\n\tIs anyone for Merle???\n\nMERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if\nsuddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he\npushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,\nstill in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body\nsag over it.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tWho here is for Merle...?\n\nThere is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the\nrain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The\nGUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by\nMERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little\nchildren.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tWho... here... is for Merle...?\n\nMERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very\ndramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(with GUARDS)\n\tMERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!\n\tMERLE IS MAGIC -- HA!\n\nMERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the\nGUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same\ntime NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing\nbehind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.\nTWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO\nGUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with\nAK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,\nthey GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.\n\nIt is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled\nmess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --\nuninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...\n\nEXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nBarely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow \nis a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step\nforward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.\n\nINT. THATCHED HUT - DAY\n\nThe SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK\nspins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and\nlets go with the AK 47.\n\nEXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY\n\nMERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious\nand the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far\ncan be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.\nAs MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the\nside of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along\nbehind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.\n\nMERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the\nground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,\nSAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo\nwith an expression of pure terror.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tWhere are we going, Merle? Are we\n\tgoing home?\n\nThere is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.\nMERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his\nmouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.\n\nFor a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on\nand we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow\nrasps.\n\nThe sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS\nappear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is\nalmost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving\ndown the hill.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding\nand his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in\nhis skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he\nlooks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.\n\nEXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT\n\nA huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and\nshakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.\n\nMERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and\nslides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,\ntoo tired to move.\n\nSAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The\nrope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud\nand his eyes are huge with terror.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMerle?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(a whisper)\n\tRight here.\n\nSAL crouches down in the mud.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tWhere are we going, Merle? Are we\n\tgoing home?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\t\t(barely moving his lips)\n\tRight here.\n\nAnother explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In\nthe flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the\nmiddle of the road. There is another explosion and another\nflash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it\nappears miraculously unharmed.\n\nNICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside\nNICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only\none who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long\ntime, trying it out with one eye and then the other.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMerle?\n\nNo answer.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n\tMerle?\n\nStill no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.\nGetting no response he crosses fearfully toward the\nautomobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches\nout and touches it.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n\tMerle. Merle, a car!\n\nAs the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the\ntires and begins kicking them.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n\tHey! Hey, gee!\n\nSAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage\nwhatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL\npulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,\nhits the starter...\n\nTHERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR\nGOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.\n\nEXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - BURNING CAR - NIGHT\n\nMERLE has dragged SAL from the car and thrown him in the\nditch below NICK. SAL is horribly burned and MERLE kneels\nover him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous\neyes -- howling with helpless rage.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tDamn it!!! God damn it!!!\n\nMERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh\nbut his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\tSal!\n\t\t(more gently)\n\tSal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you\n\tknow anything?\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tWhere are we going, Merle? Are we\n\tgoing home?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(nods)\n\tSure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.\n\nEXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY\n\nREFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,\nfrightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of\nconveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the\nvast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing\non foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the\nroad and the great human tide streams around it, as if it\nwere an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine\ngun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters\nclatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the\nskids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting\nthe REFUGEES into the ditch.\n\nMERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.\nNICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh\nbandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a\njeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.\n\n\t\t\tGENERAL\n\tWhere's your unit, soldier?\n\nMERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without\ncomprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a\nslight shrug.\n\n\t\t\tGENERAL \n\t\t(to his DRIVER)\n\tC'mon. We'll take him along.\n\nThe GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the\nembankment toward MERLE.\n\n\t\t\tGENERAL (CONT'D)\n\tLittle R and R and you'll be\n\tstanding tall again, son... Damn,\n\tthis is steep!\n\n\t\t\tDRIVER \n\tUh-oh. Sir.\n\nThe GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl\nhandled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible\nclick.\n\n\t\t\tGENERAL \n\tUh-oh.\n\nThe GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the\nembankment and pile in the jeep.\n\n\t\t\tGENERAL (CONT'D)\n\t\t(as they take off)\n\tY'know, there's more fucking\n\tmaniacs coming out of this\n\tconflict...\n\nMERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below\nthe REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the\nthousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE\nwatches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.\n\nEXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY\n\nMERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS,\nHOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a\nspeck in the vast human torrent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY\n\nThe room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is\nalone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill\nfitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the\npallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on\nwhich is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft\nthunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby\nhydraulic mechanism.\n\nEXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nBlack BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot\nconcrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE\nPFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets\ninto the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT.\n\nINT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY\n\nNICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.\nSuddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR\n\tIs your name Solomon?\n\nNICK shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tAre you sure?\n\nNICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tLemme see this.\n\nThe DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tIs this yours?\n\nNICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tThis isn't yours. This can't be\n\tyours! I'm going to take this one\n\toff and cut it up...\n\t\t(he extracts a pair of\n\t\tscissors and does so)\n\tShred it... so no one gets a hold\n\tof it. What I'm going to do now,\n\tI'm going to give you this one.\n\t\t(he staples a new marker\n\t\taround NICK's neck)\n\tThere. How's that? Does that feel\n\tbetter?\n\nNICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him.\n\n\t\t\tDOCTOR (CONT'D)\n\tThat one's yours.\n\nThe DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders\noverhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek\nand whine...\n\nNICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers\ndown at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him\nof something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a\nPHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,\nthen closes his wallet and puts it away.\n\nINT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY\n\nBanks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the\ntelephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to\ncall home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment\nposters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is\nplaying.\n\nNICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front\nof him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again,\npeers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back.\nNICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --\nand then he stops, frozen with fear.\n\n\t\t\tGUM CHEWER BEHIND \n\tGo on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours!\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(mumbles)\n\tYou go ahead.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads\nfor the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.\n\nEXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY\n\nNICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He\nis drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting\nalong for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH\nVIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket\nfor a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the\ngutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his\neye.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(calling)\n\tSal...! Sal!!!\n\nNICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even\nlooking.\n\nVehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between\nthem, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand\non the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is\nnot SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tSorry... Thought you were someone\n\telse.\n\nThe SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea\nof bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and\nproduces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a\nlong swallow.\n\nINT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT\n\nThe place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad\nBAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a\nkind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene\ncontortions.\n\nNICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a\nBAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI love Linda, see. I love Linda\n\tmore than I can even say.\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL \n\tEverybody love Linda.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tThat's right. That's exactly what I\n\tmean!\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL \n\tI love Linda.

You come. \n\t\t(pulls him to his feet)\n\tLinda have special, crazy fuck.\n\tThat right?\n\nNICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL (CONT'D)\n\tI give you special, crazy fuck,\n\tjust like Linda. Come. You come.\n\tLinda cry, make crazy moan?\n\nNICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL (CONT'D)\n\tI give you cry, crazy moan. Come.\n\tYou come.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT\n\nThe BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him\nto a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his\nwaist and the other down the front of his pants.\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL\n\tYou like to call me Linda now?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tLinda, yeah.\n\n\t\t\tBAR GIRL \n\tYou call me Linda, just like home.\n\nSuddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at\nthe end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR\nGIRL and pushes up against the glass.\n\nEXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n\nSeated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite\nbuilding is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white\nceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.\nMotorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both\ndirections. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of\nsome timeless, silent kingdom.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT\n\nNICK spins away from the window.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHey... Hey, elephants! Look at\n\tthose elephants!\n\nThe BAR GIRL stares at him.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tLinda loves elephants!

I mean let's talk\n\telephant.\n\t\t(notices a GROUP OF STREET\n\t\tURCHINS)\n\tHey you guys...! Over here! Come\n\tover here and carry elephants!\n\nThe STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged,\nmalnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are\ncovered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another\nhas lost a hand.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tEveryone take an elephant!\n\t\t(to the YOUNGEST URCHIN)\n\tYou know how to carry an elephant?\n\t\t(the URCHIN nods)\n\tThat's what I thought.

That's better. I mean...\n\tGod damn, I mean that's elephants\n\tnow! Wait. Now you wait while I get\n\tchange.\n\nNICK dives into a nearby bar.\n\nINT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT\n\nThe place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a\njukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK\ncrosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM\nand then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A\nROAR OF NOISE.\n\nNICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute\nsilence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over\nthe city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar.\n\nEXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT\n\nA nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted\nexcept for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which\nlie this way and that, like broken dolls.\n\nNICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with\nfragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like\nchunks of snow.\n\nEXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT\n\nThe sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS\nrock the night and SIRENS wail.\n\nA lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street.\nAs the figure approaches we see that it is NICK.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(toneless, over and over)\n\tHey, hey, the wind does blow. \n\tHey, hey, the snow does snow. \n\tHey, hey, the rain does rain...\n\nNICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion.\nThen, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tHey, hey, the wind does blow.\n\tHey, hey, the snow does snow...\n\nNICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the\nPHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious\ndetermination, as if this link were the last, as if by\nstaring at it hard he could make it hold.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\t\t(his voice thin, cracking)\n\tHey, hey, the wind does blow.\n\tHey, hey, the snow does snow --\n\nThere is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK\nspins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the\nunmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.\n\nNICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he\ncrosses toward it.\n\nEXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT\n\nA tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the\naround are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them\nexpensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown\noff. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the\nback of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another\ncorpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians\nhe is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the\nright temple.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (V.O.)\n\tIf you are brave and lucky I can\n\tmake you rich.\n\nNICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape\narbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S\naccent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a\nbottle of champagne and several glasses.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (CONT'D)\n\tYou have played?\n\nNICK stares at the MAN, nods.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (CONT'D)\n\tOnce you have played it is not so\n\thard. Cigarette?\n\nNICK shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (CONT'D)\n\tYou seem... disturbed.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tI... No. You do this for money?\n\n\t\t\tMAN \n\tMais certainment... A great deal of\n\tmoney. Naturally I do not do it\n\tmyself. I myself do not possess the\n\tnerve.\n\t\t(smiles)\n\tBut I am always... how do you\n\tsay... looking out for those who\n\tdo... It is a thing quite rare.\n\tChampagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't\n\tsay no. When a man says no to\n\tchampagne, he says no to life and\n\tthat no man must ever do.\n\t\t(gives NICK a glass)\n\tWhere did you play?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tUp north.\n\n\t\t\tMAN \n\tAh yes. Of course... So few\n\tsurvive.\n\t\t(smiles)\n\tLa creme de la creme... How did you\n\tobtain release?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tPlaying.\n\n\t\t\tMAN\n\t\t(raises his eyebrows)\n\tPlaying?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tWe... Three bullets.\n\n\t\t\tMAN \n\tAnd then you...\n\nThe MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a\npistol. NICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tMAN (CONT'D)\n\tHow extremely clever. That is\n\treally most extraordinaire... Allow\n\tme please to introduce myself. I am\n\tArmand... And you are?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNick.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tNick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you\n\tknow that I have a cousin who is\n\tcalled Nicholas and a nephew\n\tNickolai. So you are, comme on dit,\n\ten famille. In the family.\n\nThere is another SHOT from inside and another round of\nAPPLAUSE.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI have to go.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tBut you must come in.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo, I --\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tBut I insist.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI have to go.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tYou are frightened, no?\n\nNICK nods.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND (CONT'D)\n\tOf what is there to be afraid? The\n\twar? The war is no problem. It is a\n\tjoke, a silly thing. I make one\n\tcall and get you out.\n\nARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is\nas thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss.\nNICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tSee, I'm going home.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tAh yes. Of course.\n\t\t(smiles)\n\tTo the girl who waits.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(gives him a look and\n\t\tsits)\n\tYeah... Do you mind if I sit?\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tBut of course! Please make yourself\n\tcomfortable. Perhaps you would\n\tenjoy some fresh caviar, or une\n\tpetite glace, or --?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(weary, shaking his head)\n\tNo. None of that.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tUnfortunately I must now go in, but\n\tI leave you my card. Naturellement\n\tI pay my players cash American.\n\tJust so you know.\n\nARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes\nagain.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n\tHowever, should you prefer German\n\tmarks, or perhaps Swiss francs,\n\tthis of course can be arranged.\n\tEverything can be arranged.\n\nARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of\nhis FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching\nwith another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building\nand there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated\nat a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it\ntight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of\nfire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the\ncity like a great dead wind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK\n\nThe trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a\nplum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the\ntrailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,\nhand-lettered banner which says \"WELCOME HOME NICK!\" and it\nwhips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.\n\nNICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard.\nAlongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming\nfrom all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and\ncongregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.\n\nEXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - COLUMBINE AREA - DUSK\n\nWe see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the\nOLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and\ncookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a\nbunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two\ncases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the\ntrailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who\nis unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of\nevery car and screaming, \"This is it! This is Nick!\" and\nthen, when it isn't, saying, \"Not yet! Just hold your water,\nI'll tell you when!\"\n\nAnd we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW\nPost come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms.\nWhile three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a\nFIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.\n\n\t\t\tVETS \n\tThree cheers for the red, white and\n\tblue...!\n\n\t\t\tVET #1 \n\tThis is hard.\n\n\t\t\tVET # 2 \n\tChrist Almighty, it's fifty years!\n\n\t\t\tVETS \n\tThree cheers for the red, white and\n\tblue...\n\nINT. TAXICAB - DUSK\n\nNICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by\nunwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has\nbought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS.\n\nSuddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the\ntrailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping\nup and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time\nunder the flapping banner.\n\n\t\t\tCAB DRIVER \n\tWhadda welcome! Will you lookit...\n\tWhadda welcome!\n\nNICK stares at the approaching trailer.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tThat's not it.\n\n\t\t\tCAB DRIVER \n\tWhat're you, crazy? That's not\n\tit??? You said a trailer. You said--\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tThat's not it. Keep going. Go\n\tstraight.\n\n\t\t\tCAB DRIVER \n\tHey, now listen. Now you said --\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI'm telling you that's not it! Now\n\tkeep going!\n\nNICK throws himself down on the floor.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tJust keep going! Just keep going\n\tstraight!\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK\n\nLINDA is outside, standing with VINCE and ALBERT.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tThis is him. I'm telling you, this\n\tis Nick!\n\nThe TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all\nwatch as it disappears over a rise.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t(to VINCE)\n\tI thought that was it.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tSo he's in the next one, Albert. I\n\tmean take it easy.

MOTEL - DUSK\n\nA huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing\nangrily, as if it were full of bees.\n\nThe TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in\nhis cab and pulls away.\n\nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK\n\nNICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His\nduffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled\nalong the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is\ndraining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw\nswallows. .\n\nNICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it\nagain. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is\ngone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like\nthat of an animal run to the ground.\n\nNICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands\nand looks out.\n\nEXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK\n\nThe five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the\npale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged\nclouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire.\n\nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK\n\nNICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly --\nstares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair,\nthen he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins\ngulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and\nfast as he can.\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN\n\nThe banner stretching to the house across the street has been\nwhipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside\nNICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same\nvintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are\nentirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a\nmoment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the\ntrailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,\nand then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS\nshe has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start\noff, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.\nThe STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up\ncar, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing\nout is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses\nare rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the\nSECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back\ninside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.\nThe GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her\nmissing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.\nShe returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe\nand they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave\nthere is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and\nJOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half\nundressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with\ncoffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes\noff. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at\nJOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in\nthe car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes\nto the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave\nthem in the back seat and take off again.\n\nJOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.\n\nLINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of\ncoffee.\n\nEXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN\n\nNICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway,\nwatching.\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN\n\nLINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer.\n\nEXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN\n\nNICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the\ntrailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket,\ndrains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs.\nStraightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it\nwith his fingers. Then he starts down again.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN\n\nCakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover\nalmost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the\nlittle settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and\nhunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with\npainful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is\ntrying her God-damnedest.\n\nThere is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to\nbe totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses\nto the door and opens it.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tGuess who.\n\nLINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t(throws herself in his\n\t\tarms)\n\tNick! Oh, Nick, you're back!\n\nShe hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull\napart.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tI thought... Oh, Nick, I thought\n\tyou were hurt, some accident. Maybe\n\tyou fell or maybe some car...\n\t\t(back in his arms)\n\tI thought someone stole you away!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tOh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!\n\nThey pull apart.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tHow are you?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tFine. I'm fine. How are you?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tFine. I just go along, you know.\n\tDown at the market. Back here. I\n\tmean it just seems there's a\n\tmillion things to do!... Are you\n\tsure you're all right? I mean, what\n\tabout the wound?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(anger)\n\tThat was nothing. That wasn't\n\tanything.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tBut --\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tIt was just the complications. I\n\tmean, you take a little thing over\n\tthere and then you get\n\tcomplications. I mean all the guys\n\thad it.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI made you a sweater. \n\t\t(she gets it)\n\tHere... You have to take that off.\n\nNICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tI couldn't remember your exact\n\tsize.\n\nThe sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to\nNICK's knees.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\t\t(smoothly)\n\tOh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a\n\tlittle too big... \n\t\t(she pulls the sweater\n\t\tback off)\n\t... but I can easily fix that.\n\tEasily. One thing about wool\n\tsweaters, they are such a cinch to\n\tfix.\n\nShe crosses to a garbage pail out of NICK's line of sight and\nstuffs the sweater in it.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHow's the trailer?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tGreat. Fine... Once or twice it did\n\tfall off the blocks. I don't know\n\twhat that's from.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tFrost.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIs that what it is? I couldn't\n\tfigure out.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tDid you get hurt? You didn't get\n\thurt?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tOh, no. It just kind of goes thump.\n\tWould you like a Coke? You don't\n\tdrink Coke. Or maybe you do. What\n\tabout champagne? Let's have\n\tchampagne! I don't think we have\n\tchampagne. Let's have this. See?\n\tSparkling. I'll get you an opener.\n\tOh, that's right. No opener. Let's\n\tjust have beer. Do you want some\n\tcheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we\n\tshould have coffee.\n\nShe begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tNick? I'm so glad you're alive! I'm\n\tso happy! I... I just don't know\n\twhat to do!\n\nEXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY\n\nNICK and LINDA are some distance away. NICK is shaking hands\nwith an ENTHUSIASTIC MAN while LINDA stands to one side,\nwatching his face, and so full of love that she seems about\nto burst. ANOTHER MAN comes over. LINDA takes the MAN's arm\nand presents him to NICK.\n\nWE CANNOT HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID. THE ONLY SOUND COMES FROM\nTHE MILL WHICH LOOMS UP BEHIND THEM OUT THE FROZEN VALLEY\nBELOW.\n\nINT. PIZZA PARLOR - TABLE BY WINDOW - DAY\n\nNICK and LINDA sit opposite one another. Across the street a\ncoal train is rumbling slowly by and NICK is watching it. The\ncars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.\nSuddenly the last car appears. The car passes and there is\nsilence.\n\nLINDA gives NICK a smile.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tIt was all for nothing. Do you know\n\tthat? It was all for nothing.\n\nLINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to\nrespond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and\nshrugs. He picks up the check, stands.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNick?... I just want to say how\n\tsorry I am about Sal and about\n\tMerle. How... I know you loved them\n\tand I know it's not the same. I\n\tmean now.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tNaw, it's...

SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY\n\nThe place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading\na tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking.\nNICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER\nwho is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and\nshouting orders all at the same time.\n\n\t\t\tMANAGER \n\tYou did a good job, kid. Pettrucio,\n\there! You did a good job. Gimme a\n\tcount on these pears! I think we\n\tgot 'em now, know what I mean? The\n\tpears, the pears!

STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nNICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he\nlooks as if he had been waiting for some time.

He did... what hadda be\n\tdone... and so he did it... and\n\there he is!!!\n\nINT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT - LATER\n\nNICK sits at the bar flanked by VINCE and ALBERT. Both VINCE\nand ALBERT are completely glassed out. Behind, in the booths,\nthree or four STEELWORKERS are sleeping. JOHN moves around\nbehind the counter wiping things off.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tRough, huh?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tRough.\n\t\t(he nods)\n\tWe didn't have to do it, John.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tNo?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tNo. How's Angela? How's she taking\n\tit?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tNot so good.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tNo?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tWorse since she talked to him.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t(with a dull beery blink)\n\tFucking A.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tWorse since she talked to who?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tSal.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tTalked to Sal?\n\t\t(stares at him)\n\tSal's alive?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tKind of. You didn't know?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(pushes off the counter)\n\tSal's alive???\n\nJOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tHe's real bad, Nick.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(stares at them)\n\tWell, where the hell is he!!! I\n\tmean what are we all sitting here\n\tfor!!!\n\t\t(tears begin streaming\n\t\tdown his face)\n\tWHAT THE HELL IS THIS???\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tNick...\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tHey, Nick...\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tNick, we don't know where Sal is...\n\tNick, Angela won't tell us.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhy?... What do you mean?... Why???\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tNick, she won't say why.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tBut Sal's mother! What about Sal's\n\tmother!\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tShe's out of her tree, Nick. She is\n\tstraight out of her tree.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(stares at them)\n\tOh, Jesus.\n\nHe walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tOh, Jesus!!!\n\nNICK turns and goes out.\n\nINT. SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT\n\nThe room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by\nthe window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie\nglow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny\none, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to\nanother.\n\nThere is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in\nwith NICK.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tI know I know you. So familiar.\n\tSuch a familiar face. Oh, I know\n\tnow! The toaster man! I'll go and\n\tget it for you.\n\nSAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tYou're back.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tI'm glad. Seriously... I'm very\n\tglad.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tAngela, I just heard Sal was alive.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tSure. Why not.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhere? Where is he?\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tNick, he's fine. He's in a hospital\n\tand they're fixing him up.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYou talk to him?\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tOh, sure... Twice a day.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhat hospital is he in? Where?\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tNick... Sal is very weak. He\n\tsuffered a severe wound... and\n\tright now he doesn't want a whole\n\tlot of people to get involved in a\n\twhole thing.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHey, Angela, Sal and I go back a\n\tlong way.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tHe doesn't want people bugging him,\n\tNick!\n\nANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands\nup.\n\nShe stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and\nwrites down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK\ncomes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and\nstands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the\npiece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tAngela...?\n\nANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding\nNICK's eyes.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tDid you ever think life would turn\n\tout like this?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tANGELA \n\tYou know what Sal's got now?...\n\tSal's got... one arm, Nick, and...\n\tthat's it.\n\nThe door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in\nwith an electric toaster and a screwdriver.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER \n\tHere. This is it. What you do, you\n\tstick this in here.\n\nPushes the toaster in NICK's arms.\n\n\t\t\tSAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)\n\tThen you jab it, see. Jab it good.\n\tSomething's in it. Hear? Listen.\n\tSomething's in it. What? What's\n\tthere?\n\nEXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT\n\nNICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother\ngave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church\nwe hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and\ndark, like a great river rolling through the night.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears\nglistening in his eyes.\n\nEXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n\nWe see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half\nopen and snow is blowing in.\n\nEXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT\n\nNICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in\nhis hands.\n\nINT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nLINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tIt just seems sort of strange\n\tcoming to a motel... Like a\n\thoneymoon. Or some kind of parlez\n\tvous ... Not parlez-vous!\n\t\t(she giggles)\n\tWhat am I saying? That's those\n\tcocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I\n\tmean is rendezvous. Some kind of\n\trendezvous.\n\nLINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at\nherself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She\nstrikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and\npoking a finger in her mouth.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tDo you know what I mean?... Nick?\n\nNICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes\none last look at herself and goes out.\n\nINT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nAs LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she\nstops dead in her tracks.\n\nNICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe\noff and sound asleep.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tNick?\n\nNICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at\nhim -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a\nwistful shake.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tNick...? Nick, it's me!\n\nBut NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits\ndown on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,\nshe stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off\nhis shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his\nshirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a\nfresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she\nslowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.\n\nNICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH\nSCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND\nSTUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF\nSOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.\n\nCAMERA HOLDS ON LINDA'S FACE.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT. STEEL MILL - CASTING ROOM - DAY\n\nNICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other\nend of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic\nstrips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they\nsignal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.\n\nCAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace\nwhich is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze\nof cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.\n\nALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises\nthe door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,\nstanding like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances\ntoward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of\nhis asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have\nstuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace\nnow, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it\nthrough the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is\na white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a\ngeyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the\ndoorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and\nshowering him in a great cascade of white sparks.\n\nINT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT\n\nNICK sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in\nthought. All around him STEELWORKERS are shouting, yelling,\ncracking jokes. After a moment VINCE pushes in, claps him on\nthe back.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tHow's it feel, huh? How's it feel\n\tto be back?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(forced enthusiasm)\n\tGreat. Feels great... Fuckin' A!\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tI mean, I guess you still think\n\tabout Nam. Right? I mean --\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNaw.\n\t\t(shakes his head)\n\tUh-huh.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tHey, Nick, you ever do it with one\n\tof those slants?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tNo!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNever one.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tOh, Jesus!\n\t\t(looks around)\n\tYou're kiddin'!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tOne, Vince... you have to\n\tunderstand, doing it with one...\n\twould be... like nothing. They're\n\tsmall, see, so if you're smart you\n\tget about six or eight. I mean, if\n\tyou want to have any fun.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tSix or eight.\n\t\t(nods) \n\tAnd they go wild?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(lowers his voice)\n\tThey have these little sticks,\n\tVince. They call them \"chomp\n\tchomps\", and when you get these\n\tgirls going, you have to stick 'em\n\tin their mouths.\n\nVINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is\nbone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his\nbelief is total, then a frown crosses his face.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tYou're full of shit!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(nods)\n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t(pounding him on the head)\n\tAnd I believed you! I oughta punch\n\tyou out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey,\n\tlet's go huntin'! Albert! Hey,\n\tAlbert! Let's go huntin'. What do\n\tyou say? Nick? What do you say?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tSure.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tHey! Fuckin' A! Hey!\n\nHe spots JOHN passing with a tray of beer.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT (CONT'D)\n\tHey, John!\n\nALBERT scoops JOHN into his arms where he holds him from\nbehind.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tYes, Albert?\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\t\t(into his ear)\n\tJohn,we're going huntin'.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tWho's going?\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tWe're all going.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tNick's going?\n\n\t\t\tALBERT\n\tNick, Vince, Albert and John.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tNo women?\n\n\t\t\tOTHERS \n\tNo!

Fuckin' A!!!\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His\nhunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he\nis staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the\nwindow by a street light on the corner. There is a sound\noutside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with\ngroceries.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tNick?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tRight here.\n\nLINDA crosses to the doorway.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tOh. Nothing... Sitting.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tYou're going hunting?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(blankly)\n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tI see you're going hunting.\n\nNICK looks at the equipment on the floor.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tYeah... All the guys, we're all\n\tgoing huntin'. Like we did. You\n\tknow? Like we always used to.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tThat's wonderful. I think you\n\tshould... fresh air.\n\nNICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with\npain and his voice is cracked with emotion.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYou know how sometimes you're going\n\talong... You're going along... And\n\tthat's all...! One thing is right\n\tafter another, like steps... And\n\tyou step along.\n\nNICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tI don't know where that is... It's\n\tgone! That's gone!\n\nA car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE\nand ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (V.O.) \n\tLet's go!!!\n\n\t\t\tALBERT (V.O.) \n\tHey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI gotta go.\n\nNICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and\nheads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her\ngroceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tI'll be... I don't know... Couple\n\tof days.\n\nNICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER\nGROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.\nSNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT\nHISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY\n\nSnow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice\ncovered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound\nin a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the\nwhispering, fitful, spinning flakes.\n\nNICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting\nsnow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,\nfollowing the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see\nthat he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY\n\nA magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks,\nlooking down the slope.\n\nNICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.\n\nThe BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly\nand vanishes into the trees.\n\nEXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY\n\nVINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on\nall fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area\nabove VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in\nevery direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that\nit sounds like a full scale war.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tWhat are you, kiddin'? Are you\n\tkiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I\n\tcoulda had her! She...! One time\n\tshe begged me, practically begged\n\tme. Listen, I had her tit, which\n\twas out, in one hand, and my other\n\thand... You know that mole on the\n\tinside of her right leg? Well, I\n\twas past that mole, way past that\n\tmole, and I was --\n\nJOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope,\nsingle file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO\nOF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is\njust getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls\ndown. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush\nover to the TWO DEAD DEER.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(coming after them)\n\tNice shootin', you guys. Not bad.\n\tNot half bad.\n\nLeans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen DEER.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\t'Course how could you miss, right?\n\tTwenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean,\n\tif I'd'a been where you guys were --\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tPsst. Vince!\n\nJOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has\ncome out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and\npeers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,\nwhich immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the\nchamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is\nhooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot\nricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.\nAs they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and\nthen VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY\n\nThe wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK\nappears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,\nlistening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.\nThe BUCK is behind him, bounding away.\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY\n\nThe BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching\na deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns\nsharp left and disappears.\n\nNICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going\nhard.\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY\n\nNICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs\nover. As he touches down on the other side there is a\ngrowling sound.\n\nNICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that\nhe has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the\ntop of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder\nbegins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and\nboulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...\nand then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to\nunknown depths below.\n\nEXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY\n\nALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log\nbeside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat,\nguzzling beer out of both hands.\n\n\t\t\tJOHN\n\tSweet! Oh, that is sweet!\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tHey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a\n\thot shit... except cold.\n\nJOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,\nthen cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are\nscattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT\nand JOHN stand up.\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY\n\nThe DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of\nthe woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE\ncomes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.\nVINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one\nshoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and\nperceptibly bent.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tI got this one!!! This one's\n\tmine!!!\n\nVINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head\nover heels.\n\nEXT. DITCH - DAY\n\nVINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises\nhis rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin\ncoming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The\nDEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the\nDEER, draws his pistol...\n\nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nCars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are\nsitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming\nthemselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the\nembankment.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tI got this one!!! This one's\n\tmine!!!\n\nThe panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked\ncars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN\nTHE CARS dive for cover.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\tHold your fire! I got this one!!!\n\nVINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.\nHUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes\nout, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets\nup. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The\nDEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.\nVINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\tI got it! I got this one!\n\nEXT. WOODS - DAY\n\nThe DEER staggers through the trees, blood pouring from its\nwounds. VINCE comes stumbling after it. HE FIRES, FIRES\nAGAIN.\n\nEXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY\n\nALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the\nwoods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.\n\nThe DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.\nVINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is\na DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tGun! Gimme gun!!!\n\nALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a\ncartridge in the chamber.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(looks around, bewildered)\n\tWhere's it gone?\n\n\t\t\tJOHN \n\tInside, Vince.\n\nVINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the\nfloor, motionless, DEAD.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tI got it! Hey, you guys, I got\n\tit!!!\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY\n\nThe wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way\nand then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black\nspeck in the endless expanse of shifting white.\n\nAs NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His\nclothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow\ngasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK\nAPPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are\nno tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in\nthe driving snow.\n\nThe wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in\nagain from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the\nsilence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.\n\nNICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty\nfeet away, looking down at him.\n\nNICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights\ndown the barrel.\n\nWE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.\nNICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.\n\nNICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND\nDISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.\n\nNICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE\nHAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(grins)\n\tDamn... God damn...\n\nEXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY\n\nNICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock\nface. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a\nsnow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it\nmight be something from a dream.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(shouts)\n\tHey! Hey... okay!\n\nINT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT\n\nThe Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the\nwind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out\ncold.

He grabs up the pistol and\ncocks it.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t(shrieking)\n\tSay that one more time!... Say\n\tit!!! Go on, say it!!!\n\nNICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at\nthe pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun\nwith one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.\nNICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and\nbegins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches\nover, pulls NICK away.\n\n\t\t\tALBERT \n\tNick! Nick, you'll kill him!...\n\tEasy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince\n\tgoes back a long way.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(grimly)\n\tYeah.\n\nVINCE gets to his feet.

You think I\n\tdon't know!!!\n\nNICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR.\n\nFor a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the\ntrees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is\nstill soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.\n\nNICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI'm going to throw this fuckin'\n\tthing away.\n\nNICK goes out.\n\nEXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT\n\nFor a moment NICK stands in the light from the door,\nlistening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again,\nthen he heaves it into the trees.\n\nThe wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through\nthe woods in great streaming wraiths.\n\nNICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK\n\nThe trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls\ninto the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK\ngets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK\ngoes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and\npounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb\nwith his load of THREE DEAD DEER.\n\nNICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\nTWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western.\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\nIn the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE\nwe see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down\nthe polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize\nit is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the\nbottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and\ntrails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been\namputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly\nscarred and what expression he displays is centered in his\neyes.\n\nSAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE\nRECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD.\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tHello?\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his\nhunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tSal?

One great\n\tplace... Basketball, bowling. You\n\tname it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of\n\tguys are making salad bowls. What\n\tI'll do is make a salad bowl for\n\tyou, unless you'd rather have a\n\tpencil holder. The pencil holder's\n\tneat, I mean --\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John\n\tWayne's making so much noise I can\n\thardly --\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tI gotta get back, Nick.\n\nSAL looks around in desperation.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (CONT'D)\n\tThey're passing out popcorn now, so\n\tI'll be talking to you... maybe\n\tnext year.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND\nOF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES...\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tSal?... Sal?\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT\n\nSAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor.\nAt the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back\nat the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into\nthe flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry\ncharge.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then\nputs the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks\naround in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye\nfalls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,\nhurries out the door.\n\nEXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nThe lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping\ncarts which a CLERK is banging together.\n\nNICK gets out of his car and goes in.\n\nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\nTwo or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front.\n\n\t\t\tCHECKER \n\tShe's in back.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tThanks.\n\n\t\t\tCHECKER \n\tHow was huntin'?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tOh. Fine.\n\n\t\t\tCHECKER \n\tGet anything?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tCHECKER \n\tToo bad.\n\nNICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at\nthe back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair,\ncrying.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tLinda... Honey, what's wrong?\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\t\t(helpless shrug)\n\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHey. Look. There must be something.\n\nLINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tI'm just so lonely.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tC'mon. I've got the car.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\t\t(shakes her head)\n\tI'll be out... Just leave me. I'll\n\tbe out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.\n\nNICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.\n\nINT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\nThe CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The\ncarts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.\n\nNICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands\nbegin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.\n\nEXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nNICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out\nof the door and crosses towards him.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tYou okay?\n\nLINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA\n\tLet's make love, Nick.\n\nLINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA (CONT'D)\n\tLet's make love forever!\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nLINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across\nthe pillows, like a dancer leaping.\n\nNICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking\ndown at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her,\nfusses with her slippers until they are straight and then\ngoes to the window.\n\nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n\nThe wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the\nfrozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN\nappears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly\ndressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,\npolished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the\nlight of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.\n\nTHE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY\nSIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.\n\nTHE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,\nTHEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands\nmotionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at\nLINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to\nthe window again.\n\nEXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT\n\nThe street is empty. The MAN is gone.\n\nINT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants,\nshirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of\nslices.\n\nEXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\nNICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.\n\nNICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.\n\nEXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT\n\nNo one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.\n\nNICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is\nirked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a\ncar door close and en engine start up. A black limousine\npulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A\nCHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.\nThe PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the\nMAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face\nis not visible.\n\nAs NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The\ntail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and\ndisappears.\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY\n\nSunlight streams through a window. The television is going.\nIn a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side\nand his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed\nin his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray\nin front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,\nmilk and a little box of Wheaties.\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY\n\nSomeone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet\nappear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive,\ntailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six\nshooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.\n\nMERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.\n\nEXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY\n\nNICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts\ntoward the building.\n\nINT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY\n\nMERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without\nexpression, then MERLE continues down the stairs.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY\n\nNICK is pushing SAL down a walkway.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tSal, we need you. We need you.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tHey, Nick. How can you need me?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWe do, Sal. We do... You're the\n\theart.\n\nTurns SAL and sits on a bench.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tSal, you're gonna die! You're gonna\n\tsit in that corner watching soaps\n\tand you're gonna die!... I'm not\n\tsaying it's gonna be the same. It's\n\tnot gonna be the same, but whatever\n\tit's gonna be we're all gonna do\n\tit, Sal. God damn it we are! We are\n\tgonna do it!\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tNick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin'\n\tscared to go home.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\t\t(nods)\n\tI know. It's like coming from the\n\tmoon. Or Mars.\n\nSAL laughs.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tDid you go hunting.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tDid you get one?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tYou didn't get a deer?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI tracked this one, a big buck.\n\tGod, he was such a beauty--! What's\n\tthis suitcase here?\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tWhere?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tHere. Behind you.\n\nNICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tI don't know.\n\nNICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the\nclasps.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tMaybe Angela brought you stuff. I\n\tknow she said --\n\nThe suitcase slips over the back of the wall.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tShit!\n\nNICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of\nthe suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are\nscattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I\n\tmean, if it's socks or something\n\tjust let 'em go.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY\n\nNICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The\nbundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.\n\n\t\t\tSAL (V.O.)\n\tMaybe you could use socks, Nick.\n\tJesus, I mean, come to think of it\n\tsocks are pretty expensive now.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tIt's not socks, Sal.\n\nNICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking\nfor identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he\nnotices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the\nbundles of bills.\n\nThe paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered\nand it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket\nfor a long time.\n\nNICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and\nunfolds it.\n\nTHE CARD READS \"EXHIBITIONS\". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER\nON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND\nGAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS\nROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.\n\nEXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY\n\nNICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable\ncars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the\nsuitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tWho is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't\n\tunderstand.\n\nNICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself\nback with effort.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tIt's Merle, Sal.\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\tMerle? ... Merle's alive?\n\t\t(NICK nods)\n\tHow do you know?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI saw him last night. I thought I\n\twas dreaming. I thought I was out\n\tof my mind.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tMerle gave me this?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tBut, Nick... Hey, I mean, where\n\twould a guy like Merle get money\n\tlike this?\n\nNICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the\nmoney. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly\noverwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he\nmaintains a casual tone.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tOh cards, maybe. Poker... It's\n\tgetting cold, Sal. I'm going to\n\ttake you in.\n\t\t(starts off)\n\tWe'll call Angela. The guys can\n\thelp her bring you home... Did I\n\ttell you I was going on a trip?\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\t\t(panicked)\n\tTrip? What do you mean, Nick? You\n\tsaid you'd be --\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tIt's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a\n\tweek. Just to see Phantom Mary.\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\tPhantom Mary?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tDidn't I ever tell you about\n\tPhantom Mary?\n\n\t\t\tSAL \n\t\t(laughs)\n\tNo. \n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(starts off again)\n\tWell... Phantom Mary's on my\n\tmother's side. Naturally no one\n\tthere admits it because Phantom\n\tMary's pretty weird... You want to\n\thear the whole story?\n\n\t\t\tSAL\n\t\t(enthusiastically)\n\tYeah!\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tLike I say, Phantom Mary's pretty\n\tweird... Lives alone, lives way out\n\tin the middle of nowhere with a cat\n\tcalled Pajamas and a cow called\n\tFred. Well, last week I got a call\n\tfrom Phantom Mary, which in itself\n\twas very strange...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n\nINT.

The chair splinters into pieces and\nthe MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud.\n\nNICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels,\nremoves his pistol and jams it in his belt.\n\nEXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT\n\nThree MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open\niron gate.\nAs NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to\nattention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by\noutside.\n\nEXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT\n\nNICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card\nthat he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets\nit ring a long time but there is no answer.\n\nEXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nNICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing\nthe yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND.\n\nEXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nThe yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low\nbuzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a\ncandle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses\nand lights it.\n\nThe yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet\ncushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the\nCORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe\nwith maggots.\n\nNICK straightens, looks around.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tMerle!!!\n\nThe back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol\nand goes in.\n\nINT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT\n\nNICK finds his way blocked by a door. He steps back, hurls\nhimself against it. The door gives way with a crash and he\nstaggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red\nvelvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.\n\nOut beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of\nbroken cafe tables, a FAMILY OF REFUGEES stare at him in\nterror from the other side of a small fire.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(waves pistol)\n\tIt's okay.\n\nThe REFUGEES cower back even further.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\t\t(screaming)\n\tIt's okay, God damn it! It's all\n\tright!\n\nPOUNDING and BANGING come from the direction of the front\ndoor. NICK crosses...\n\nINT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT\n\nNICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and\njerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and\nfalls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the\nheadlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN\nOFFICERS and WHORES.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL\n\t\t(no attempt to get up)\n\tHey, good buddy, how you doin'?\n\t\t(gestures)\n\tThis is Biederman, you guys.\n\tBiederman, this is Son Loc, Tu Fon,\n\tHuckerbelly and Potts. What's the\n\tstory here, Biederman? We're\n\tlooking for... Wait a minute.\n\nHe fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL (CONT'D)\n\tHere it is. Chez Armand.\n\n\t\t\tWHORE \n\tChez Armand not here! Chez Armand\n\thas gone to other spot!\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL \n\t\t(gets up)\n\tHoney, c'mere. Come right here.\n\nThe COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and\npresents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL (CONT'D)\n\tThis is for bein' so smart.\n\nThe WHORE shrieks with pleasure. EVERYONE laughs.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL (CONT'D)\n\t\t(arm around WHORE)\n\tLet's go! Mount up! C'mon\n\tBiederman!\n\nThe COLONEL throws an arm around NICK and they all start for\nthe cars.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL (CONT'D)\n\t\t(to NICK)\n\tBoy, do I love this conflict.\n\tHuh?... What the hell were you\n\tdoin' in there?\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tYou know a guy named Merle?\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL \n\tMerle? That's who we're looking\n\tfor. Merle.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL \n\tSure! I got eight hundred potatoes\n\tsays he goes one more... He\n\tretired, you know.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL \n\tNow he's back.\n\nPulls NICK close so he can whisper in his ear.\n\n\t\t\tCOLONEL (CONT'D)\n\tHe eats 'em... Sure... He eats 'em\n\traw!\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT\n\nAn elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The\nhouse is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have\nbeen set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred\nyards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns\nwhich bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --\nwandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and\nstrolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are\nAMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are\nOFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed\namong them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from\nsports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to\nnationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,\nBELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and\nMISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except\nto dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander\nabout, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT\n\nJeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked\nside by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars\nfrom various government agencies and a blitz of civilian\nvehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.\n\nMore vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like\nplumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT\n\nA dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One\nhas crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.\n\nThere is a mounting clatter in the distance and another\nhelicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly\nhandsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his\nWIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back\ncompartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their\nBABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off\ntoward the house.\n\nINT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nGambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is\nheavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one\nof reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an\nhour.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT\n\nLow bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle\nfacing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single,\nblindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and\ntwo velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them\nVIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on\nthe table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in\ntuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.\n\nAlthough the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam\nthe first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the\nbets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the\nshifting odds on a large board.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in\ndisbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.\n\nNow a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet\ncloth.\n\n\t\t\tREFEREE\n\t\t(amplified)\n\tGame number seven. Gentlemen will\n\tplease wrap.\n\nThe CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.\n\n\t\t\tREFEREE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(as he loads revolver)\n\tOne cartridge. Game to be played to\n\tcompletion. Forfeit automatic after\n\tdelay of one minute.\n\nThe REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table\nand spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L\nand R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.\n\n\t\t\tREFEREE \n\tGentleman on the left will now\n\tcommence play.\n\nThe REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The\nCONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the\ncylinder, cocks it and\n\nplaces it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger...\nand clicks out.\n\nNICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the\nback of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR\nTHE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A.\nSYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...\n\nNICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his\ntemple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A\nDEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.\n\nThe FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS\nTO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS\nHEAD AND DANCES AROUND.\n\nNICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory.\nHe looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in\nfive languages.\n\nNICK starts off again, hurrying.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT\n\nNICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads\nblown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing,\nsquatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS.\nSome of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE,\nseveral of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of\nthe contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF\nTHE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.\n\nSuddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins.\nTWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND\nCONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and\nscreaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the\nSECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily\nremoved, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS\nin it.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND (V.O.) \n\tIf you are brave and lucky I can\n\tmake you rich.\n\nNICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him\nfor a fraction of a second and then smiles.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND (CONT'D)\n\tC'est tres amusant... You have been\n\tpromoted. And to a Jew... I am\n\tjoking of course. Naturellement.\n\tSeriously, Nick, may I hope that\n\tyou have come to play?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI came to see Merle.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\tAh. Merle. And you know Merle?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\t\t(studies him)\n\tYou are his friend.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tWhere is he???\n\n\t\t\tARMAND \n\t\t(faint smile)\n\tMerle is under his tree... Beside\n\tthe terrace. You can't miss him.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT\n\nGUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down\nthrough the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering\nlike birds.\n\nLaughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny\nlanterns bob and sway.\n\nNICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.\n\nMERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone,\ndressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an\nexpression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,\nor snow flakes, or falling stones.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(shouts)\n\tMerle!\n\nMERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When\nNICK reaches the table, he stands.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tMerle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tNick!... I thought you went home.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tI did. I... This is stolen. I came\n\tback.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE \n\tSit down.\n\nNICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't\nknow where to start.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(breaking the silence)\n\tHow's Linda?\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tFine. She's fine... Merle, what the\n\thell are you doing?\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\t\t(eyes him)\n\tI like it, Nick.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tMerle... Hey, Merle, listen... \n\t\t(stares at him)\n\tWhy?\n\nFor a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like\nfaded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if\nto some landscape far beyond.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE\n\tI like it because it's simple.\n\nA BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something\nin MERLE's ear.\n\n\t\t\tMERLE (CONT'D)\n\t\t(stands)\n\tI have to go, Nick. We'll have a\n\tdrink.\n\nMERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\tMerle...! Merle, wait!\n\nNICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly\nthrough a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.\n\n\t\t\tNICK (CONT'D)\n\tMerle!!!\n\nNICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around\nto the terrace.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT\n\nNICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.\n\n\t\t\tNICK \n\tExcuse me... Sorry... Sorry...\n\tPardon.\n\nNICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL\nVIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT\n\nNICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.\n\n\t\t\tREFEREE (V.O.)\n\tGentleman on the right will now\n\tcommence play.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nThe gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS\nTHROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER\nTHE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE\nSOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK\nINTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.\n\nSuddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts\ntoward the entrance to the bleachers.\n\nA SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he\nruns.\n\nEXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT\n\nNICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.\nThe CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes\nthrough a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned\nrelief spreads over his features.\n\nOn the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,\nhead bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.\n\nNICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with\neveryone else.\n\nOn the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists\nin the air and begins hooting maniacally.\n\n... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE\nSPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.\n\nINT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY\n\nPipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of\nleaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their\nuniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE\nOTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient\nattention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with\na bugle, trying to play TAPS.\n\n\t\t\tVET 1 \n\tUp a little there... What would you\n\tsay?\n\n\t\t\tVET 2 \n\tUp.\n\nThe VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts\nover...\n\nINT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY\n\nThree tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The\ntables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN\nare setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a\nfuneral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the\nplacement of each knife and fork.\n\nAS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS\nTHE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS\nBARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET\nWITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.\nBUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS\nWATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.\n\nGradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the\ntable. They stand motionless, listening.\n\nEXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY\n\nA HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and\ngrey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a\nghostly cloud of white exhaust.\n\nTHE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK\nTRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.\n\nIn the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the\nchurch swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with\nMERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear\nthe COFFIN slowly down the steps.\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\nSnow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand\ntogether on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn\nheadstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling\nclouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and\ngroans.\n\nEXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY\n\nThe PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The\nMOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.\n\nCAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help\nSAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets\nstuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful\nof dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.\n\nNICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS\ncome to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and\ntremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.\n\nINT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY\n\nThe meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are\nsmoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter\nand conversation.\n\nNICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA\nand SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are\ntears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.\n\n\t\t\tLINDA \n\tEat something, Nick. Eat a piece of\n\ttoast.\n\nNICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all\nabout it, lays it absently on his plate.\n\nVINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a\nnew blue suit.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE \n\tYou want to say a few words, Nick?\n\tI think you should. Like that would\n\twind things up.\n\nNICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE (CONT'D)\n\tQuiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,\n\teverybody, Nick has a few words.\n\n\t\t\tNICK\n\t\t(very shaky)\n\tI just... would like to say a few\n\twords... about Merle. I guess Merle\n\talways wanted something... I don't\n\tknow... better. That fucking guy,\n\the saved my Life. He saved Sal's...\n\tWhat Merle liked, he liked things\n\tright... But then there wasn't any\n\tplace for that... that he could\n\tfind.\n\nTears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,\nlooking miserable.\n\n\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t(hisses)\n\tJohn! Play something!\n\nJOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,\ncasts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing\n\"America The Beautiful\".\n\nA FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.\nThen EVERYONE stands up.\n\n\t\t\t\t THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeer Hunter, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Deric Washburn\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0War\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:50.908455"}
