We \n               see a long straight stretch of white beach. Behind the low \n               dunes are the dark shapes of large expensive houses. Hear a \n               number of voices singing. It sounds like an eastern \n               university's alma mater, no longer distorted.\n\n<b>               EXT. BEACH \u0096 NIGHT \u0096 ANOTHER ANGLE\n</b>\n               Around a blazing bonfire, a group of young men and women, \n               beer cans (or maybe a keg) in evidence, as well as the bota \n               Spanish leather wine-bag much in favor by beach and ski-bum \n               types.\n\n               The group is swapping sentimental alma maters, weepily singing \n               eastern Ivy League anthems -\u0096 Dartmouth, Cornell, Harvard, \n               Penn, etc. Two young people break away from the others. They\n\n               are Tom Cassidy and Chrissie. Behind them, there is \n               considerable necking activity; Tom and Chrissie are more \n               serious.\n\n<b>               TOM\n</b>\n               Makes a clumsy attempt at snaring Chrissie, cups her from \n               behind. She squirms playfully out of his grasp. We discover \n               he's not especially sober.\n\n<b>                                     TOM\n</b>                         Hey! Hey hey!

ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH \u0096 NIGHT\n</b>\n               Tom and Chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted \n               against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is \n               plodding along in the sand, winded.\n\n               Chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, \n               leaving Tom reeling atop the dune. As she runs, she is \n               shedding her clothes. Tom is trying to trail her by her \n               clothes, like Hansel following bread crumbs through the woods.\n\n               But Chrissie is way ahead of him.\n\n<b>                                     CHRISSIE\n</b>                         C'mon!\n\n               She runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly \n               into the water with a light \"Whoops!\" as the cold water sweeps \n               over her.\n\n               Behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery \n               chorus of alma maters.\n\n               Then we see it -- a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that \n               passes her a dozen feet away. A pressure wave lifts her up, \n               then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.\n\n<b>                                     CHRISSIE\n</b>                         Tommy? Don't dunk me...\n\n               She looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his \n               feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his \n               ankles. She starts to swim back in to him.\n\n<b>               EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER\n</b>\n               Her expression freezes. The water-bulge is racing towards \n               her. The first bump jolts her upright, out of the water to \n               her hips. She reaches under water to touch her leg. Whatever \n               she feels makes her open her mouth to scream, but she is \n               slammed again, hard, whipped into an arc of about eight feet, \n               up and down, submerging her down to her open mouth, choking \n               off any scream she might try to make. Another jolt to her \n               body, driving her under so that only her hair swirls on the \n               surface. Then it too is sucked below in a final and terrible \n               jerking motion. HOLD on the eddies and swirls until we're \n               sure it's all over.\n\n<b>               EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH\n</b>\n               In his shorts, laughing to himself, turning in slow stoned \n               circles, held prisoner by his windbreaker which seems to \n               have him in an armlock, as he struggles to free his arm from \n               a tight sleeve. As he turns, we hear the alma maters in the \n               background, from the fire.\n\n<b>               INT.

It catches Martin \n               Brody right across the eyes, bringing him up from sleep.  \n               The job is completed by the clock radio, which clicks on \n               with local fisherman's report and weather.\n\n<b>                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)\n</b>                         Hayes Landing reports conditions \n                         good, with stripers and jacks.

Hendricks stops him with a wave-off, saying \n               something at the same time. Brody nods understanding and \n               steps up cautiously and looks down.

He falls \n               backward in a sitting position as though shot. Nods yes -- \n               it's her. Brody turns and slides off the dune, stumbling \n               close.

The \n               armada is spread out and moving in a ragged circle, fifteen \n               boats in all. One man heaves cherry bombs into the water. A \n               smaller boat going in the opposite direction offers us \n               Barwood, forking spaghetti leftovers into the ocean while \n               his friend pours out a bottle of ketchup.\n\n               A speedboat chugs by, one of the occupants reading \n               instructions aloud from a book entitled \"Sharks - East Coast, \n               Vol. I.\"\n\n               boatload of impoverished scallop fishermen throw a net \n               overboard, full of gaps and split ends. The professionals \n               look professional, but the landlubbers out for the $3000 \n               make it impossible for everybody.

Shouts of I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! Then a tangle \n               of tackle springs from the water. They have hooked each other.\n\n               Joy turns to swearing.  Arnold Felix stands up to applaud \n               the mishap, while his buddy Pratt takes careful aim with his \n               Remington 1100 12-gauge and blasts at the tackle as if it \n               were a clay pigeon.  The tangle explodes --\n\n               Both the Out-of-Towners and the Scallop Fisherman falls over \n               backward --\n\n<b>               ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT\n</b>\n               Three men are aboard, one holding a rod which holds a fast \n               arc. A few yards off stern we see a triangular dorsal fin \n               crossing back and forth, struggling, jerking, the mighty \n               tail threshing. One man is screaming success, the other two \n               slapping the angler on the back.\n\n<b>               CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX\n</b>\n               They spot it and sour.\n\n<b>                                     PRATT\n</b>                         Well, get over there! He ain't caught \n                         it yet!\n\n               The owner of Pratt's boat throws it forward and Pratt removes \n               a .45 automatic from the holster of his belt. He tests it, \n               firing once in the air. As they near the scene of the \n               struggle, eleven other boats begin converging, until --\n\n<b>               HARRY'S BOAT\n</b>\n               Everyone wants to get into the act. They are attacking the\n\n               threshing beast with all they've got. Pratt uses his \n               automatic, another blasts point blank with a shotgun. There \n               are occasional water ricochets and the bounty hunters duck \n               from time to time as bullets skip by. Finally, the shark \n               stops threshing.\n\n<b>               FELIX AND PRATT\n</b>\n               Their boat has moved close to the shark, closer than Harry's.\n\n<b>                                     PRATT\n</b>                              (exultant)\n                         Hand me that pole!

The man swings, lodges the gaff and \n               hauls the shark up onto the gunwale. A paroxysm of cheers \n               from the surrounding boats. Smoke flares are fired into the \n               air.\n\n<b>                                     HARRY\n</b>                              (a tug-of-war)\n                         Let go my shark!\n\n               It is a ten-foot tiger, and what a mess -- splattered with \n               bullet punctures, gashes, bleeding from several orifices. \n               But it is not dead -- it kicks back to life and threatens to \n               capsize the boat. Pratt panics and fires six times with his \n               .45. The bullets pierce the shark's head, pass through, and \n               split the fiberglass hull through which a flood of water \n               rises.

Damn \n                         near eleven hundred men went over \n                         the side. The life boats was lashed \n                         down so tight to make the bomb run \n                         we couldn't cut a single one adrift. \n                         Not one.

We formed tight groups -- \n                         somewhat like squares in an old battle -- \n                         You know what I mean -- so that when \n                         one come close, the man nearest would \n                         yell and shout and pound the water \n                         and sometimes it worked and the fish \n                         turned away, but other times that \n                         shark would seem to look right at a \n                         man -- right into his eyes -- and in \n                         spite of all shoutin' and poundin' \n                         you'd hear that terrible high \n                         screamin' and the ocean would go \n                         red, then churn up as they ripped \n                         him.  Then we'd reform our little \n                         squares. By the first dawn the sharks \n                         had taken more than a hundred. Hard \n                         for me to count but more than a \n                         hundred. I don't know how many sharks. \n                         Maybe a thousand. I do know they \n                         averaged six men an hour. All kinds -- \n                         blues, makos, tigers.

It was mainly \n                         the young fellas that did that -- \n                         the older ones stayed where they \n                         was.

The Great White passes the transom, \n               the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed-\n               off cable.

He removes the rubber guard from the needle and \n               waits.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Delicately, they change \n               course and meander toward the lowered cage.\n\n<b>               UNDERWATER - HOOPER\n</b>\n               His back is to us. He is just now completing a visual sweep \n               and turns, eyes front into closeup and: fixes wildly on \n               something monstrous... and fascinating.\n\n<b>               HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW\n</b>\n               The water is clear and shafts of sunlight streak downward in \n               the blue. From the deep gloom -- diving slowly, smoothly -- \n               comes the shark. It moves with no apparent effort, sinuous \n               beyond comparison. As it nears the cage, it turns, and its \n               ghastly length passes right in front of him: first the snout, \n               then the jaw, slack and smiling, then the black eye.\n\n               Hooper tentatively reaches out. It is too far for the \n               strychnine pole. The vinyl flesh is pocked with bullet holes, \n               iron scars, gaffing hooks and strange open wounds that tinge \n               the passing currents with pink.\n\n<b>               SURFACE\n</b>\n               The trailing barrels gong and scratch the keel of the Orca \n               above. Brody and Quint leap back.\n\n<b>               HOOPER - CLOSE\n</b>\n               The shark has vanished into a cloud of rising silt. Hooper, \n               expecting the shark to attack out of that same general \n               direction, braces himself, pole extended through the bars, \n               breathing faster, straining his eyes into the gloom and... \n               we see that the shark attacking from behind him.\n\n               The cage is sent careening. Hooper grabs the bars for dear \n               life. The shark has grabbed the steel struts in its brutal \n               jaws, shaking the cage relentlessly from side to side, bending \n               the bars like clothes hangers. Hooper can't turn the pointed \n               end of the pole around, his body jammed as far away from the \n               non-rational attacker as possible.\n\n               Hooper is trapped.\n\n               The shark withdraws to get some running room then charges \n               again. The bleeding snout thrust deeper into the yawing bars, \n               the jaws snapping and twisting, two feet from Hooper's torso, \n               the tail thrusting it forward. Hooper drops the strychnine \n               pole between the bars and it tumbles slowly toward rapture \n               depth.\n\n               All the shark needs is one more good thrust before separating \n               Hooper at the waistline. Through frantic bubbles Hooper \n               fumbles with the overhead hatch cover, kicking up and out of \n               the cage. The shark backpedals with its tail, but the broad \n               head won't shake loose.\n\n               Hooper rushes downwards, after the strychnine pole.\n\n<b>               ANGLE - SHARK\n</b>\n               The shark twists free of the cage and arrows downward after \n               Hooper.\n\n               Hooper nearly recovers the pole. Again it slips from his \n               frightened grasp and this time disappears into a narrow abyss.  \n               Hooper turns and looks up.\n\n               The Great White is lunging at him, twenty feet above.\n\n<b>               SURFACE\n</b>\n               One of the barrel ropes snakes around the cage rope and pulls \n               taut.\n\n<b>               HOOPER - DEEP\n</b>\n               Turning to meet the monster which -- though held back for a \n               moment by the snarled rope -- now surges forward.\n\n<b>               SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT\n</b>\n               The Orca is listing dangerously aft, the ginpole bent almost \n               to the breaking point. Brody is in a frenzy trying to haul \n               up the cage. Quint attaches the end of Brody's rope to a \n               hand-winch. The ginpole is splitting.\n\n<b>                                     QUINT\n</b>                         Let go of it!\n\n               The pole gives way, the rope whipping down on the gunwale... \n               the pulling of the tonnage below is tipping the Orca, dragging \n               it, but Quint won't give up the winch.

The crushed cage bangs against the hull then breaks \n               water.\n\n               Brody is horrified.

It rises vertically, towering overhead, \n               blocking out the sun. The pectoral fins seem to reach forward.  \n               The shark, in all of its monstrous glory, falls onto the \n               stern of the boat with a shattering crash, narrowly missing \n               Quint and Brody. It drives the stern underwater, the ocean \n               pours in over the transom. The jaws snap from side to side.  \n               Brody flounders backwards away from it.\n\n<b>               CLOSE - BRODY\n</b>\n               He is clinging to the mast for dear life, as the ship begins \n               to tilt to stern, and everything starts to break loose around \n               him.\n\n<b>               NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA\n</b>\n               The giant jaws are snapping irresistibly at everything: great \n               chunks of wood torn out of the deck and superstructure.\n\n               Deck chair, irons, rope, gear, beercans, bottles, Brody's \n               bag, all are food for the insatiable maw blindly churning \n               away.\n\n               Quint is clinging next to a rack of lances: he is enraged at \n               this ultimate violation of his territory. He snatches up a \n               lance and hurls himself at the shark with a wordless bellow.\n\n               The great head weaves side to side, the deck is at a \n               treacherous incline, slippery with blood and seawater. Quint's \n               footing falters and slips, he stumbles at the Mouth of Hell, \n               the big teeth seize him and snap.\n\n               Quint's roar of rage and pain is choked off as his body is \n               clamped between the grinding, sawing teeth, and his head and \n               legs suddenly contort as the shark's teeth meet across his \n               torso. Blood gushes onto the deck. The remnants of his body \n               tumble from the shark's mouth.\n\n               Brody sees the horror, hears the screams -- in his \n               desperation, he tears loose one of Hooper's remaining air \n               tanks, and hurls it at the monster. It tumbles into the bloody \n               well, wedging across the back of the mouth, the thick steel \n               blocking the cruel jaws.\n\n               The shark's head shakes even more violently, trying to clear \n               the cold iron, but the tank is in to stay.\n\n<b>               DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY\n</b>\n               To avoid sliding into the jaws, Brody scrambles on the titling \n               deck, bracing himself in the cabin door to avoid pitching \n               down into the bloody mouth. He fights his way into the cabin, \n               already a shambles.\n\n               Below him, on the deck, the shark lunges again, shifting \n               weight so that the boat in now stern down, and listing to \n               the side. Water from the sea pours into the cabin.\n\n               Another lunge by the shark. The huge snout and jaws slam up \n               against the doorframe, blocking escape, bloody, gnashing.\n\n               More seawater. To stay in the cabin is to go down with the \n               ship.\n\n               Brody clambers as far from the shark as he can, against the \n               forward wall of the pilothouse. He sees the window Hooper \n               used before. It's blocked by barrels and debris. He breaks \n               the side window highest above the water, edges out onto the \n               battered bridge.\n\n               The shark rolls around, now half in the water. The ship is \n               sinking, the sea is not a viable alternative. Brody climbs \n               up into the flying bridge.\n\n               The shark is still lunging and snapping. Brody is forced to \n               climb higher and higher as the ship slowly sinks beneath \n               him.\n\n<b>               CLOSE - BRODY\n</b>\n               He scrambles for his life onto the flying bridge, sees the M-\n               1 stuck there, seizes it.\n\n<b>               OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN\n</b>\n               He is bracing himself, aiming the rifle, taking a bead on \n               the steel tanks, silver gleaming in the bloody shark's mouth.  \n               He fires. And fires. Bullets shatter the shark's teeth, \n               punching holes in the dripping snout.\n\n<b>               WIDE ON THE ORCA \u0096 EXPLOSION\n</b>\n               With a muffled boom, the perfect symmetry of the shark is \n               suddenly blown apart in a geyser of steel and blood as Brody's \n               shot hits the pressurized tank. A 30-foot cloud of water, \n               steel, shark and debris covers the sky.\n\n               A gigantic convulsion hurls the Great White's mangled body \n               into the sea.
