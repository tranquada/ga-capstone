Wind tossed.\n\n               INSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast \n               asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS... \n               Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they \n               SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR, \n               as a soft voice says:\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Shhhhh.\n\n               And there's MOM, kneeling beside her. Vague shape in the \n               dimness. The full moon throws light across one sparkling \n               eye.\n\n                                     LITTLE GIRL\n                         Mommy, the men on the mountain...!\n\n                                     MOM\n                         Shhhh.

I love you.\n\n               The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother \n               rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads \n               for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --\n\n               Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood \n               on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun.\n\n               She staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out \n               on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed. \n               The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the \n               glass.\n\n               FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               It's snowing in southwestern Ohio. Before us, nestled in the \n               rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia.

SUBURBAN STREET - DAY\n\n               CHILDREN, dozens of them, bursting from houses. Slapping of \n               screen doors. A HORSE-DRIVEN SLEIGH is rattling down Main \n               Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from \n               loudspeakers.\n\n               HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his \"Ho's\" in \n               groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire \n               marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off.\n\n               Beside him sits MRS.

I hope \n                         you believed, even for a day. No one \n                         did, Ma. No one at all. It's cold \n                         here. I'm sorry you're dead.

SAMANTHA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWO DAYS LATER\n\n               Samantha, having survived. Laid up now in an austere hospital \n               room. Listening to silence. Stares out the window at a sunlit \n               tree. Head bandaged. Frowns:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I want a cigarette, why do I want a \n                         cigarette...?\n\n               Outside, snow slithers... Her eyelids, slowly closing. Slides \n               off the edge of consciousness...\n\n               IN THE DREAM: She stands on a windswept cliff, before an \n               incongruous FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. Staring at her reflection -- \n               it's bleeding from a scalp wound.\n\n               She probes her head... frowns. Nothing. Nothing but the tiny \n               RIDGED SCAR she's had for as long as she can remember.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         What... what do you want...?\n\n               The reflection eyes her grimly. Haggard. Tired.\n\n                                     REFLECTION\n                         I want a cigarette.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I don't smoke.\n\n                                     REFLECTION\n                              (chuckles)\n                         You used to.\n\n               Samantha is suddenly holding a cigarette. She raises it to \n               her lips. Her reflection MIRRORS her precisely. Except \n               Samantha COUGHS, chokes on the smoke -- While her bloody \n               reflection takes a long, satisfying drag.\n\n                                     REFLECTION\n                         Relax, you can drop the act. Nice \n                         and smooth, take another hit. There \n                         you go. See how easy it comes back?\n\n               They are now in perfect synchronicity. Sam inhales easily.\n\n                                     REFLECTION\n                         *I'm* coming back. You know that, \n                         don't you? Name's Charly, by the \n                         way. You're gonna love me.\n\n               The reflection grins. There's blood on its TEETH.\n\n               INT. SAMANTHA'S HOME - DAY\n\n               Back at home, business as usual, pre-Christmas. A COMMOTION \n               has arisen: Gingerly, bones still aching, Samantha moves \n               toward the KITCHEN. HAL and CAITLIN trail behind.\n\n                                     HAL\n                         Honey, you can't cook, I'm not wrong \n                         about this.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I'm *remembering*, Hal. Things are \n                         coming back. Trust me, I'm a chef, I \n                         know it.\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Daddy, make her stop!\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Hush. Go to the garage and get me \n                         something, anything. A veggie, go, \n                         man, go! I'm hot to trot.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN/GARAGE - SAME\n\n               Hal worriedly exits to the garage. Plucks a tomato from the \n               fridge, tosses it to Caitlin, who stands in the door.\n\n                                     HAL\n                         Tomato.\n\n               Caitlin turns, tosses it to Sam --\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Tomato.\n\n               Who catches it, plops it on the cutting board and proceeds \n               to DICE it to SIMTHEREENS. Razor-thin slices. Knife a blur. \n               Missing her fingers by millimeters, never faltering, like a \n               mad mumblety-pegger --\n\n                                     HAL\n                         Onion, flying in.\n\n               Sam catches it. Knife flurries. Pieces, flying up.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         More. Faster.\n\n               And it becomes a bucket brigade. Hal heaves veggies to Caitlin \n               who spins and relays to Mom who slices, dices, purees, and \n               even makes curly fries. Veggies, incoming. HAL starts to \n               lose it, starts lobbing them at Caitlin, one after another, \n               she giggles, starts throwing them overhand --\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Tomato. Tomato. Tomato.\n\n               And now it's a food fight, PELTING Mom, and the floor is \n               COVERED with food as Hal stumbles in laughing, scoops up \n               Caitlin --\n\n               Samantha shakes her head, grinning, dices to pieces a last, \n               lovely radish. Ends with a flourish, TA-DAH-! Doesn't think: \n               Flips the knife point up on ONE FINGER. Tips it for balance. \n               Lobs a tomato. Slings the knife without looking, pins it to \n               the wall, KA-CHUK--!\n\n               Everyone goes silent. The knife, quivering. Caitlin and Hal \n               turn as one, gaping at her. She shrugs numbly. Blinks.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Uh... chefs do that.\n\n               INT. BOILER ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT, IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL\n\n               Underground. Water GURGLES through overhead pipes. Furnaces \n               hum and tick in the sweaty gloom.\n\n               A SHIRTLESS MAN is tied to a chair. Weeping. Before him, \n               what looks like a young GQ model. Blonde. Gorgeous. Impeccably \n               attired. For the record, TIMOTHY. He looks his captive in \n               the eye as the guy blubbers:\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Please, man...

I'm FBI, for Chrissake, you \n                         can't do this to me. I don't know \n                         ANYTHING.\n\n               Timothy stares him full in the face, eyes narrowed... as \n               though seeing into his brain. He nods, satisfied.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         No. You don't.\n                              (beat)\n                         I can always tell, you know...

We don't see it, but we FEEL the \n               impact. The FBI man's face contorts in SHOCK. Twisted. Inches \n               away from Timothy, their eyes lock...\n\n               A CELLULAR PHONE BEEPS. Timothy reacts, annoyed. Plucks it \n               from his belt and flips it open:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Timothy.\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Message from Mr. Daedalus.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         I'm listening.\n\n               He shrugs at his captive.

CUT TO:\n\n               INT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT\n\n               CAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST \n               CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter-\n               top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone, \n               saying:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas \n                         station... Right. Thank you Mr. \n                         Henessey, I'll see you shortly.\n\n               She hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn \n               around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the \n               linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes:\n\n                                     HAL\n                         She rode all the way home. She didn't \n                         fall, not once. She didn't cry.\n                              (beat)\n                         You're good.

I can't \n                         even remember what I said to her...!\n\n               Hal takes a breath, composes himself.\n\n                                     HAL\n                         We can still make six o'clock mass, \n                         you coming?\n\n               Sam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging \n               pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         A private detective's coming by, \n                         he... he's found something.\n                              (beat)\n                         I may have to go away.

Broken quite \n               suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside \n               the front door. The sweet strains of \"God Rest Ye Merry, \n               Gentlemen\" wafts in through the window.\n\n               Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are \n               TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at \n               each other, what the hell...?\n\n               EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR - NIGHT\n\n               THE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes \n               fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the \n               SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE-\n               109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on \n               bottom. You'd sing shitty too.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - SAME\n\n               Samantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive \n               M&M's. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS. \n               Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door. \n               Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK.\n\n                                     ONE-EYED JACK\n                         Evening Charly. Long time.\n\n               He swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass \n               shatters, M&M's everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck, \n               unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, \n               live or *die* --\n\n               SHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps \n               CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers --\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Mommy...!\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         GET OUUTTTTT!!!!\n\n               Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from \n               the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave, \n               useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip \n               to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS, \n               over and over on broken ribs --\n\n               JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs. \n               Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of \n               the stairs, paralyzed.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         NO!!!!\n\n               Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws \n               a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun \n               goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A \n               storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward \n               her daughter --\n\n               JACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS \n               three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can \n               see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter -- \n               flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her \n               by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...!\n\n               EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n               Two stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW \n               MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails \n               head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and \n               unhurt.\n\n               BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE\n\n               Samantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK. \n               Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down \n               the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls \n               to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME\n\n               She hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum, \n               slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the \n               IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--!\n\n               A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind.\n\n                                     ONE-EYED JACK\n                         I want my eye back, bitch.\n\n               Samantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the \n               shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf -- \n               Slams it against her head.\n\n                                     ONE-EYED JACK\n                         Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong \n                         with you, *fight* me!\n\n               CLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in \n               the face.\n\n               Jack raises his arm for the killing stroke -- Samantha takes \n               Hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in \n               his face.\n\n               Comes from nowhere. Back foot planted, body twisting, entire \n               organism focused into the outstretched arm, WHACK-! We have \n               never seen anyone move this fast. Samantha RECOILS. Startled \n               by what she's done --\n\n               The glass dish is SPLINTERED into his head. It STICKS there. \n               He topples. Hits the linoleum. She straddles him, breathing \n               hard. Winded.\n\n               The barking dog \"Jingle Bells\" plays inanely in the \n               background. Samantha stares. Trembling. Pokes the body. \n               Nothing. Pokes it again. Still nothing. She leans forward. \n               Grips the neck and wrenches, CRACK-! Just making sure.\n\n               She out of it. In shock. Glaring at her own hands as if \n               demanding an excuse for their behavior. There is pie filling \n               on her fingers. She kneels beside the corpse, catatonic. \n               Stares. Absent-mindedly licks the bloodied cream.\n\n               HAL is standing in the doorway. Wide-eyed. He has seen \n               Samantha break the man's neck. She looks at him, frowns.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         It took me three seconds. That's... \n                         that's good, huh...?\n\n               He stares, dumbstruck. She blinks. *Snaps out of it*.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Caitlin. We gotta find Caitlin.\n\n               She gets up. We RUN with her to the front door -- she flings \n               it open and collides with MITCHELL HENESSEY. Private dick. \n               Runs right into him.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Hey--! Slow down. The kid's okay, \n                         she's in my car, what the hell is \n                         going on?\n\n               Henessey spins, as FOUR POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Vomit up a \n               bevy of COPS, swarming toward the house. He spins back to \n               Samantha -- As she collapses to the floor.\n\n                                                                  FADE OUT:\n\n               Pause. FADE IN. Super the legend: ONE WEEK LATER.\n\n               ESTABLISHING - SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               Early morning quiet. HENESSEY and SAMANTHA are throwing \n               suitcases into the back of his battered Chrysler.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - LATER - EVERYTHING'S PACKED\n\n               Sam's looked better. Kneels beside Caitlin, says softly:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         That man who tried to hurt us...? If \n                         I stay here... other people will \n                         come. I have to leave. Just for a \n                         little while.\n\n               Caitlin looks at the floor. Doesn't respond. Samantha reaches \n               in a cupboard. Produces a box of CANDLES. Lights a match, \n               touches flame to one of them.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I want you to light a candle and \n                         keep it in the kitchen window. And \n                         never, *ever* let it go out, because \n                         as long as it burns...? It means \n                         you're thinking of me. And if I'm \n                         alone... if it's dark and I'm lost... \n                         It's how I'll find my way home.\n\n               She touches Caitlin's wrist cast. Pain in her features. She \n               grabs a marker pen and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         That's for a portable phone. I keep \n                         it with me, you call me anytime, you \n                         don't worry about the bill. And last \n                         but not least --\n\n               She reaches behind her head. Unhooks the KEY, the one she \n               wears around her neck.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         For luck.\n\n               Slips it over her daughter's head. Looks up at HAL, eyes \n               brimming. He whispers:\n\n                                     HAL\n                         No matter what you find, I'm not \n                         scared. Not of you. Not ever...\n\n               SERIES OF SHOTS: EXT. SUBURBAN TOWN\n\n               As it fades behind Henessey's Chrysler. Leaving behind porch-\n               bound elders, dimestore clerks. Grinning children, hair like \n               spun straw. All fading... DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH - THE OPEN ROAD - DAY\n\n               Henessey sings with the radio. Loudly. He's got the lyrics \n               wrong: \"I'm not talking 'bout the linen... And I don't wanna \n               change your life...\"\n\n               Samantha endures as much as she can. Speaks up:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         \"Movin' in.\"\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Hah?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         It's not linen. The song's not about \n                         linen.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Whatever.

It doesn't work, \n                         but it makes a very annoying noise \n                         which distracts from the cold.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I'll pass.\n                              (clears her throat)\n                         So, you're a former cop.

STORAGE RENTAL PLACE - DAY\n\n               As they clamber from the car, Henessey shoves his sunglasses \n               into his sportcoat. SINGS:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Putting my glasses in my cooooat...\"\n\n               Samantha looks at him like he's sprouted wings.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         I sing what I do so I'll remember \n                         it. \"Turning off the downstairs \n                         liiiight...\" You know?\n\n               Samantha smiles thinly.

The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers:\n\n                                     WALRUS MAN\n                         The elder Trelawney rented to her in \n                         '87, aye.

Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         See anything you recognize?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Yeah, this dirt used to be outside \n                         my window, shut up and let me look.\n                              (sighs)\n                         I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little \n                         on edge.\n\n               She pauses.

At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the \n               mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam \n               looks like she just took a stomach punch.\n\n               Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still \n               be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything. \n               She plunks the clothing back in place.

A frail-looking man, mid-\n               seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE \n               watches TV nearby.

Hands to her head, mind churning...\n\n               Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. Props her \n               SUITCASE on the sink and opens it. Flips back the mound of \n               clothing --\n\n               And there it is. The pieces, disassembled, of an M-40 sniper \n               rifle. Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their \n               own volition... Hefting them. Gauging their feel. And then, \n               slowly... terrifyingly...\n\n               Knowing how they go together. She SNAPS the barrel in place, \n               *click*-! The sound breaks her reverie. She drops the thing \n               like it's alive. Looks down, trembling...\n\n               ALSO in the case: a wicked looking HUNTING KNIFE. She picks \n               it up gingerly. Shiny, brand new. Turns it over in her hand, \n               fascinated by the play of light off the blade...\n\n               Looks up. Her REFLECTION, in the mirror. Staring back. She \n               frowns -- It frowns. She turns away --\n\n               THE REFLECTION DOESN'T. It stays right fucking put, except \n               now it's *smiling*. Malignant. Deadly. Sam feels something \n               wrong. Spins back toward the mirror --\n\n               Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. Reaches \n               into Sam's world and SLICES FOR HER THROAT.\n\n               EXT.

She's sixteen, she's a baby. \n               She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun. His finger on the \n               trigger.

Swings wide, when suddenly a HAND clutches \n               his arm. He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's \n               eyes have gone dead and cold. She lights a cigarette, shakes \n               out the match and says:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Go up this hill.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Why?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         *Drive up the fucking hill*.\n\n               Now Henessey shivers.

Pandemonium.\n\n               EXT. HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the \n               passenger side without a word.

The primary threat \n                         is the woman.

ROADSIDE GAS STATION - NIGHTTIME\n\n               Henessey is on the phone to his ex-wife.

Cracks it. Returns to the pumps, \n               where SAMANTHA leans against his car, still dazed. Looks up \n               at him, says:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I still can't believe it. You're \n                         saying my hands didn't even shake...?\n\n               Henessey doesn't look at her. Puts the nozzle back in the \n               pump. Crosses to the driver side without a word.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         What's the matter with you?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         You. You're the matter. Look, you \n                         wanna keep going, good luck. I'm \n                         driving back to Ohio.

Starts the engine. Samantha reacts, \n               distraught. Leans in, kills the ignition. Pulls him out of \n               the car.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Goddammit, lady, I'm taking you \n                         *home*.\n\n               She slaps him.

One weekend, when he was \n                         conveniently gone...? Some bearer \n                         bonds disappeared from his office. \n                         And lo and behold, when the police \n                         responded to an anonymous tip, you'll \n                         never guess what just happened to be \n                         sitting in my closet.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         The bonds.

Samantha frowns, a little thrown -- Then she \n               snorts, loses it. They both lean against his Chrysler.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Now every dollar I hand my kid, he \n                         asks his mother did I steal it.\n\n               He smiles ruefully. Spits. A pause, then:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         No more killing.\n\n               Samantha's voice is cool and level:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         No more killing.\n\n               She blows her nose.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         It was a helluva shot, wasn't it...\"\n\n                                                              DISSOLVES TO:\n\n               ESTABLISHING - SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - MORNING\n\n               A gunmetal grey sky looms overhead. The aforementioned LOUNGE \n               is a faded old roadhouse, gravel parking lot strewn with mud-\n               covered trucks. The kind that get a man laid in these parts. \n               HENESSEY'S PLYMOUTH pulls into the lot, rolls to a halt. \n               He'll never get any.\n\n               INT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - DAY\n\n               Honky-tonk. SAMANTHA and HENESSEY enter, blinking in the \n               dimness. Around them, drunk mid-day cowboys. Stringy-haired \n               girls in their ample laps. SAMANTHA consults her watch:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Quarter til. Any time now.\n\n               They sit at the counter. Henessey flags the bartender. Signals \n               for a beer. Lights a cigarette, blows smoke:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Nice crowd.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         You're just jealous of their \n                         girlfriends.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Who wouldn't be? Corner booth, there's \n                         a beaut. While you're doing her doggie-\n                         style you can pop the zits on her \n                         back.\n\n               Samantha shoots him a look. ON A TV above the bar, a British-\n               sounding CNN announcer is saying:\n\n                                     CNN COMMENTATOR (V.O.)\n                         Violence in Northern Ireland continues \n                         today, despite a plea by British \n                         prime minister John Major --\n\n               Samantha sits up straight. Draws a sharp breath. He shoots \n               her a questioning look --\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I just... got a flash of something, \n                         I...\n                              (blinks)\n                         I hurt my father.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Whoa.

I \n                         wouldn't... oh.\n\n               She rubs her eyes. Her voice breaks. She's utterly miserable. \n               Henessey leans in, says softly:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Ms. Caine, last week at a party I \n                         ran into a girl I knew from college \n                         and we chatted for a few minutes. \n                         And it wasn't til I was driving home \n                         on the freeway that I remembered \n                         that I'd screwed her in the back of \n                         a car once.\n                              (beat)\n                         Everyone forgets.\n\n               He pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         That's it?

I gotta use the head.\n\n               He stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette. \n               The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She \n               reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her. \n               She turns...\n\n               The assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         For you. Another in a long line of \n                         bad investments.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Excuse me?\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Just saw the ring on your finger.\n\n               He reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Do I know you from somewhere...?\n\n               Grimaces:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line, \n                         let's forget I said that.\n\n               Still staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION \n               on her features. She gives him a cursory smile.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't \n                         know you.\n\n               Timothy nods slowly.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         No, you don't, do you...? I'd know \n                         if you did. I can tell if someone's \n                         lying.\n                              (smiles)\n                         Sorry to bother you.\n\n               He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a \n               very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar, \n               whispers into a concealed transmitter:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Okay, people, I got what I needed. \n                         Wait until she comes out.

Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of \n               the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow. \n               Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                              (sotto)\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Pork.

Just themselves. \n                         During that show with the little \n                         girl who's a robot.\n\n               EXT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - SAME TIME\n\n               They emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their \n               mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey, \n               points --\n\n               A LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Bingo.

The door \n               opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He \n               pauses, lighting a cigarette.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Mr. Windeman...?\n\n               She strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling \n               smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a \n               hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a \n               SILENCED PISTOL.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Oh, SHIT!\n\n               *Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to \n               the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS:\n\n               She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH \n               THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another, \n               BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the \n               chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting --\n\n               Sam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*. \n               Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand, \n               wondering how in the hell it just did that.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         *Jesus wept*...!\n\n               They scamper to their feet. Running hellbent for leather \n               toward the Plymouth... They never make it.\n\n               ANOTHER HITMAN steps calmly from the trees. Stands at the \n               shoulder of the highway, full view of the parking lot... \n               Adopts a two-fisted stance. Draws a bead, locks on target --\n\n               Leaves his feet.\n\n               Takes to the air as a BLACK LE SABRE swerves off the highway \n               with no advance warning and DEMOLISHES the bastard, wham--!\n\n               The car roars across the lot, NATHAN WINDEMAN at the wheel.\n\n               INT. BARROOM - SAME TIME\n\n               The snapped-in-two hitman announces Nathan's arrival by FLYING \n               THROUGH THE WINDOW in an explosion of glass. Caroms off a \n               table and bounces head over heels. Hits, dead.\n\n               TIMOTHY swears. Leaps up and bolts for the door, right behind \n               the SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, as\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - SAME TIME\n\n               The black Le Sabre SLEWS to a stop, showering gravel -- NATHAN \n               shouts at Sam and Henessey:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Get in! Both of you, NOW!\n\n               They pile into the backseat. Nathan floors it. PEELS OUT, \n               bouncing  onto the highway -- and meanwhile here comes \n               TIMOTHY. On the run. Barks into his transmitter:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         East, they're going east. *Head them \n                         off*.\n\n               He begins to run: we have never seen anyone run this fast.\n\n               INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING\n\n               NATHAN kicks in the afterburners. Squinting, can't see... \n               WIPERS, squeaking to and fro. Erasing the hitman's blood.\n\n               Henessey is trembling; Samantha comatose. Nathan steals a \n               look in the rear view mirror. Gets his first good view of \n               Samantha. Reacts, stunned:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Charly.

Put it in myself.\n\n               Almost as an afterthought, he swerves slightly. CRUNCHES the \n               gunman against the parked car. Shatters him. His SCREAMING \n               VISAGE goes by an inch from Samantha, he coughs blood onto \n               her window...\n\n               EXT.

ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a \n               fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast-\n               approaching windshield. Kills the driver.\n\n               The car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing \n               juggernaut, immense...!\n\n               He vaults the hood without breaking stride.

Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in \n               behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar.\n\n               INT.

Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the \n               deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's \n               TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car \n               careens into a GULLEY --\n\n               BAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back \n               end sticking up, tires spinning...

Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his \n               crippled black-and-white.\n\n               Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing \n               as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching \n               the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS. \n               They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom \n               of the gulley.\n\n               INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also \n               very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door. \n               Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases \n               it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He \n               puts a shot through the radio. Silences it.\n\n               Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan \n               and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath...\n\n               EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is \n               covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police \n               cars go by on the distant highway.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Your father was in the British SIS, \n                         assigned to the Irish situation. \n                         After he was murdered in 1971, his \n                         friend Perkins recruited you for \n                         Chapter, a black bag operation working \n                         out of the U.S. State Department.\n\n               Charly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come \n                         down. You're to flush out a terrorist \n                         by the name of Daedalus. You never \n                         complete the mission, electing instead \n                         to die, of all things, despite clear \n                         orders to the contrary. And dead you \n                         remain until, without preamble, you \n                         re-emerge, eight years later and \n                         fifteen pounds heavier.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Would you lay off the weight?\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         I think we can safely assume Daedalus \n                         is aware of your resurrection and is \n                         attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I \n                         can't drive around in this thing.\n                              (beat)\n                         Any idea where we can go to stash \n                         this car?\n\n               IN SAMANTHA'S LAP\n\n               Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp, \n               crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         This address...? I... I recognize it \n                         now. I think it belongs to a friend.\n\n               Henessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope, \n               his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is \n               soaked with blood.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Perhaps you'd best drive.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY\n\n               The house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen \n               landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a \n               scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump. \n               Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around \n               the corner --\n\n               Drops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN, \n               sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Don't be afraid, we don't want to \n                         hurt you.\n                              (beat)\n                         I just want to know who you are.\n\n               Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping \n               BEAR HUG, shouts:\n\n                                     MAN\n                         CHARLY, BABY!!\n\n               Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and \n               Nathan stare. Befuddled.\n\n               TIME CUT - MINUTES LATER\n\n               The strange man (let's call him LUKE) stands awkwardly in \n               the dooryard. Shifting from foot to foot. NATHAN watches him \n               dispassionately from the tree stump. Gun on his knee.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                              (sighs)\n                         Look, is this America's Funniest \n                         Practical Videos or something?\n\n               The DOOR bangs open and Samantha comes out of the house. \n               Carrying bandages. Alcohol. Crosses to the tree stump, kneels \n               before Nathan. His voice is a harsh rasp:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Let me do it.\n\n               He bats her away, administers his own first aid. LUKE pipes \n               up, exasperated:\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         I can't believe you don't remember \n                         dating me. Charly, please, you pursued \n                         me for months.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Yeah, well. I caught you and forgot \n                         you. Sorry.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         It's December, you'll remember. \n                         Right...?\n\n               He chuckles. Looks at her face. Stops chuckling, takes a \n               sudden interest in the ground. Sam crosses to HENESSEY, \n               standing nearby. Takes him aside, whispers:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                              (sotto)\n                         This is ridiculous. What do we do \n                         with this guy?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Don't ask me, I just work here. Did \n                         you bump pelvises with him or not?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         It's possible.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         And you kid, Cathead --\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Caitlin.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Yeah, whatever. Um, could he be \n                         the...?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I don't know.\n                              (beat)\n                         It's coming back, though. All these... \n                         little details about him.\n\n               She studies Luke. Frowning. Concentrating.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I know he's got a pin in his leg, \n                         car accident. I know he cuts his own \n                         hair... thinks Rush Limbaugh's an \n                         ass. I know he sits down when he \n                         pees. I know --\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Enough. You're giving me a stiffy.\n\n               Just then NATHAN is hit with a dreadful-sounding cough. It \n               wracks him. Doubles him up. LUKE blurts out:\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Goddammit, he's *dying*. Let me call \n                         the poor bastard an ambulance!\n\n               Nathan grits his teeth:\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         *No ambulance*. The car I ordered \n                         will be here soon.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Mr. Windeman, please let him help \n                         you. I know this man, I... I'm pretty \n                         sure I slept with him.\n\n               Nathan presses a bandage to his side.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         I'm about to faint... And if you \n                         call an ambulance, I will fucking \n                         kill you.\n\n               He pitches forward into Henessey's arms.\n\n               EXT. SHADED PORCH - MID-AFTERNOON\n\n               Beside the lakeshore LUKE AND SAMANTHA walk side by side. \n               RACK FOCUS to the porch: NATHAN is laid out on a chaise \n               lounge. Henessey beside him, applying cold compresses. The \n               older man stirs, coming awake... Tries to sit up, Henessey \n               nudges him flat again.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Where's Charly...?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Relax. She's with Luke. That's his \n                         name, Luke.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Goddammit, I told you --\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Yeah, yeah, we weren't real big on \n                         what you told us. I had him call you \n                         an ambulance, so shoot me. Should be \n                         here within fifteen minutes.\n\n               Nathan groans. Henessey presses a cloth to the man's head.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         The guy's story checks out. Sam knows \n                         things about him. Stuff only a lover \n                         would know.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Sod that... just watch them.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Don't worry about it.

Lies back down.\n\n                                     NATHAN\n                         Checks. You're not fooling anyone, \n                         dear boy.\n                              (bemused)\n                         You'd wash her feet and drink the \n                         water... wouldn't you?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Cut me a break, nimrod. She's married \n                         with a kid.\n\n               Busted. Nathan coughs.

Refusing to go down.\n\n               AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly \n               in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING \n               noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't -- \n               A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside, \n               TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional.\n\n               FIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker \n               cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says:\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Sure don't look like an ambulance, \n                         does it?\n\n               SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken \n               doll.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a \n               NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or \n               long ago...\n\n               A TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy. \n               The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a \n               sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp-\n               looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter:\n\n                                     BRIGADIER\n                         ...the bombing has been linked to \n                         the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, \n                         as you know, is the counterpart of \n                         the provisional IRA and the most \n                         violent of the Protestant Paramilitary \n                         groups.\n\n               An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him:\n\n                                     ANNOUNCER\n                         Despite threats of reprisals, \n                         Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he \n                         will seek to cut UVF supply lines, \n                         especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. \n                         President Nixon concurs that...\n\n               PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n               A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a \n               rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw \n               speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date \n               as June 23, 1971.\n\n               IN THE NEXT ROOM\n\n               Girlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake, \n               dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket. \n               She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns, \n               satisfied.\n\n               One last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from \n               the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door. \n               She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits. \n               Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out.\n\n               EXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT\n\n               The boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin. \n               Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         You've never made it with a boy, \n                         then?\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         There's nothing odd about it. I'm \n                         only sixteen.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         Rubbish.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         What?\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         You're fourteen and not a day more. \n                         Here now, I'm right, you're blushing.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my \n                         father, we never stay in one place, \n                         I never meet bloody anyone.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         Saw him on the telly. Think he'd \n                         kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am.\n\n               He slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified \n               and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         You know what, I'll bet you've never \n                         even kissed a boy... now, have you?\n                              (beat)\n                         Aye, but you want to...\n\n               He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling \n               on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch.\n\n               Across the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat. \n               She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush \n               from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked. \n               Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes \n               only then that the guy is LAUGHING.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         Thanks for shutting off the alarm, \n                         you bloody Papist bitch.\n\n               He slaps her full across the face.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         Tell the press the Ulster Force claims \n                         full credit.\n\n               He spins and flees.\n\n               INT. BRIGADIER'S FLAT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Girl, moving. Walls racing past, shot to PIECES, run run run \n               into her bedroom and LURCHES to a stop, screaming:\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         *DA*!\n\n               Propped against the wall. By the bed. He's still alive. \n               Incredibly. The man has DRAGGED himself in here. He refused \n               to die, simply couldn't, you see... Not until he reached his \n               daughter.\n\n               ANGLE ON BED\n\n               Two pillows, jammed beneath a blanket. The Brigadier just \n               stares at them. His face slack. White and gastly. Shifts his \n               gaze to his daughter. Tears running from his dulled eyes.\n\n                                     BRIGADIER\n                         How much...\n\n               He raises the pistol to his head.\n\n                                     BRIGADIER\n                         ...did they pay you...?\n\n               He fires. On a young girl's dissolve into insanity we FADE \n               OUT... Sound, echoing away. Blackness, total.\n\n               FADE IN:\n\n               INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - NIGHT\n\n               Waking is slow.\n\n               Samantha opens her eyes. Blinks. Hazy, out of focus. Tries \n               to rub her eyes, can't. Hands. Something's wrong, what the \n               hell'd she do with her hands...? Ah. They're stretched over \n               her head. BOUND WITH CORD. Suddenly she's very awake.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               The basement of the old converted mill. A drafty, windswept \n               place full of old, broken timbers. A river runs through it. \n               A stream, at any rate. The waters are still and frozen now. \n               Above the stream -- A GREAT WOODEN WHEEL. Smaller corollary \n               of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis.\n\n               SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel. Lashed to its SIDE, affixed \n               to it like a goddess to a Greek sailing ship. Now the bad \n               news, the ice has been chopped away so the wheel can TURN... \n               And it will plunge Samantha UNDER THE FREEZING WATER. Beneath \n               the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing \n               only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.\n\n               THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her, giving \n               instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY. He looks up at \n               Samantha. Seeing her eyelids flutter, he tosses her a cherry \n               wave. Gone is the gee-whiz country boy schtick; in its place, \n               a frightening arrogance. He tosses her his cheeriest wave:\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         Well, good afternoon. If it isn't \n                         the forgetful spy. How you feeling?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Not-so fresh.\n\n               Samantha struggles against her bonds. No dice. Subsides. \n               Takes a look around at her predicament. TIMOTHY stands at \n               the edge of the ice. Watching her intently. Smiles thinly:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         You... you're... the man from the \n                         bar...?\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Look at her. She's not faking it, \n                         she doesn't know me from Adam.\n\n               Daedalus shakes his head, frowning:\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         It's not that I don't trust my \n                         compatriot, Colonel Baltimore. In \n                         fact, I had every confidence that \n                         your amnesia was genuine -- until \n                         you showed up *here*. You follow?\n                              (beat)\n                         Meanwhile, I just got around to \n                         reading the papers, there's the small \n                         matter of an incident upstate. Long \n                         range rifle shot, blew a man out of \n                         his socks.\n                              (coldly)\n                         You can see where I'm coming from. \n                         I'm trying to pull of the biggest \n                         job of my career. I have to know. \n                         How much you really remember... and \n                         who you've told.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         I didn't tell a soul, I swear.\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         We'll soon know.\n\n               He crosses toward a large RED BUTTON. Set into a wooden beam. \n               Samantha thrashes at the bindings. Looks down at the water \n               where it intercepts the mammoth wheel. Fighting panic:\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Is... is this a torture thing...?\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         Torture, yes. The torturing of \n                         beautiful women, albeit politically \n                         incorrect, is an addiction with me.\n                              (beat)\n                         A woman never looks quite so beautiful \n                         as when her face is distended in \n                         pain. Witness the beauty of \n                         childbirth.\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Please, I'm getting all misty. Look, \n                         untie me, I'll make any face you \n                         want.\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         Let's not, and say we did. Do you \n                         smoke?\n\n                                     SAMANTHA\n                         Smoke...? Um, no. Not... not really.\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         Good. You'll last longer. Now hush \n                         yourself, and take a deep breath. \n                         We're gonna do the torture thing.\n\n               He hits the button. An electric WHINE -- THE BIG WHEEL TURNS. \n               Feet first into the water. Struggling. Arms stretched above \n               her head. She plunges below the surface. A new dimension in \n               PAIN. Frozen, mind-numbing.\n\n               She WRITHES against the wheel. It's like a crushing VICE is \n               ripping her limb from limb. She opens her eyes, briefly. \n               Discovers she's not alone -- A mere foot from her face, THE \n               BLOATED CORPSE of the drowned NATHAN. Staring away and away. \n               Blue with cyanosis.\n\n               Meanwhile, back ON THE SURFACE: Daedalus turns to his right-\n               hand man, who says:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         We're running on schedule, I just \n                         secured the tanker. We're borrowing \n                         it from Carbide in South Carolina. \n                         Cargo listed as fire retardant.\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                              (nods)\n                         Juice up the bird, we head out soon \n                         as I'm done here.\n\n               He turns. Hits the red button again. THE WHEEL reverses \n               itself. Creaks and moans, turning --\n\n               SAMANTHA BREAKS THE SURFACE. Gasping for air. Wheezing. \n               Choking. The FREEZING WIND plasters the nightgown to her.\n\n                                     DAEDALUS\n                         Take all the air you can, that's \n                         right. If you need to vomit, do it \n                         now.\n\n               Samantha, face twisted. Coughs. Wheezes. TIMOTHY looks her \n               in the eye... shakes his head:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         You don't remember *at all*...? The \n                         greatest night of your life, shit, \n                         drown this ungrateful wench.\n\n               He exits. Daedalus, alone with his captive.

Good night.\n\n               He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus \n               walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights \n               it.

He's not wearing a watch, he \n               knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what \n               the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain.\n\n               EXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT\n\n               Henessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a \n               trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks \n               out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two.\n\n               A photo of Hal and Caitlin.\n\n               He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The \n               shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to \n               knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN, \n               swabbing at her hair.\n\n               She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's \n               unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: \"one \n               sec.\" Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying \n               him.\n\n               He cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be...\n\n               Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood-\n               red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days.\n\n               Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha.\n\n               Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a \n               changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she \n               hasn't seen the light of day in eight years.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh-\n                         oh, you're seeping.\n\n               She grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Here, look at this.\n\n               With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts. \n               Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS \n               the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Ah, that hurt like shit!!\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         That's why I distracted you first.\n                              (dabs at his wounds)\n                         Same principle as breaking in virgins.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Same as -- virgins, *what*...?\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy \n                         bites her on the ear as he goes in. \n                         Distracts from the pain. You ever \n                         try that?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell \n                         \"pop goes the weasel,\" what the fuck \n                         are you talking about? Who are you??\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to \n                         meet'cha. Drink?\n\n               INT. CASINO BAR - EVENING\n\n               Henessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the \n               differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her \n               hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, \n               scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby \n               table, steals it outright.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         See? Sit next to the dance floor, \n                         every drink's free. People finish \n                         dancing, they think the waiter lifted \n                         'em.\n\n               Henessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         I'm confused. Gimme a minute.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Take two, they're small.\n\n               She knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts \n               uncomfortably, lights a smoke.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're \n                         actually a trained killer, Jesus, I \n                         can't even say it with a straight \n                         face.\n                              (frowns)\n                         So then...

Like Nathan \n                         said, she was a total fabrication, I \n                         made her up.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Fabrication. And now she's just... \n                         gone? Forever and ever?\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Thank God. Look at my inordinately \n                         large ass, look what she did to me.\n\n               Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Pretty convincing act.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Guess so.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         I mean, her personality, it had to \n                         come from *somewhere* --\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Change the subject. Better yet, steal \n                         me another drink.\n\n               Henessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He \n               reaches over and lifts their beers.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Drink up.

Until I know, you might \n                         wanna stay away from curbs.\n\n               He looks at her, confused:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         They like to push people in front of \n                         buses.\n\n               Didn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by:\n\n                                     SANTA CLAUS\n                              (bad Caribbean accent)\n                         Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the \n                         lambada wit'choo. *Come this way, \n                         everybody*!\n\n               He shimmies away.

Pulls back, smiling -- and Henessey's \n               holding the picture of HAL and CAITLIN. The one he found \n               torn in two.

A quartet sings, \"God Rest \n               Ye Merry,\" ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing \n               tune ever written. On a crowded street, she is alone. Total \n               misfit.

Launches a SPIN KICK. \n               Shatters his jaw. Catapults him backwards.\n\n               Completes her spin, catlike -- Catches the .38 on its way \n               down. DOESN'T STOP THERE. Arm out, gun cocked -- FIRES. \n               Straight at Henessey, what...? He dives aside --\n\n               BEHIND HIM, a second HITMAN. Blown to tatters. The KNIFE \n               meant for Henessey arcs through the air...\n\n               Imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. \n               He stares at it with shocked eyes. The killer hits, dead. \n               Twitches. CHARLY. Lowers her arm slowly. Gun barrel smoking.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Fuck you.

Looks up, \n               spits gravel. Stands. Dusts himself off. Watches the Bronco \n               go far away.\n\n               TIME CUT - EXT.

Sink under \n                         the ocean, and when you come out \n                         you're a fucking schoolmarm, wanna \n                         tell me what happened?\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         I fell into a school of fish, they \n                         elected me principal. Shut the fuck \n                         up.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Mmmm. Personally...? I'm thinking \n                         maybe Samantha Caine wasn't an act. \n                         Maybe you forgot to hate yourself \n                         for eight years, ever think of \n                         that...?\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Hmmm... Nope, \n                         seems clear enough to me. Hate myself, \n                         Christ almighty. What are you, my \n                         shrink?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         No, just some loser thought he could \n                         maybe understand, fuck it. I been \n                         there, you know. I'd kill for fucking \n                         amnesia. I'm with my boy and all I \n                         can think is I got reamed in the ass \n                         by three guys. Merry Christmas, son, \n                         here's a ball glove, did you know \n                         Daddy screamed when they carved the \n                         name in his back...? Mary, by the \n                         way. I pushed for Cindy, but hell. \n                         God, I'm tired.\n                              (beat)\n                         I never did one thing right, you \n                         know it, not one fucking thing. Not \n                         even accidental, that takes skill.\n\n               He looks over. She's asleep, hasn't heard a word. Face slack, \n               lips slightly parted. The toughness banished from her \n               features. In its place, a lingering sadness. CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN BREAKING\n\n               The Bronco glides along. Charly in the passenger seat, eyes \n               roving like a hawk's. THE CAINE HOUSE is peaceful and quiet. \n               Christmas lights, still burning dimly.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Drive past, don't slow down.\n                              (points)\n                         Park under those trees, honk if \n                         there's trouble.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                              (bad Rochester)\n                         Yas, massah, I be slowin' de caw \n                         down fo' you.\n\n               She stuffs a .45 automatic in her waistband. Cradles an MP-5 \n               beneath her coat. Rolls out of the still-moving truck. Makes \n               her way through back yards. Silent as a cat. She went to \n               cookouts here. Bridge parties. Now she prowls, a grim \n               assassin.\n\n               Leaps a fence, drops behind a woodpile -- Comes face to face \n               with RAYMOND, a fifth grade student we saw earlier. Secreted \n               behind the woodpile, SMOKING. His eyes pop as he spies good \n               ol' Ms. Caine, sporting blonde hair and an assault weapon. \n               Charly doesn't miss a beat:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Good morning, Raymond.\n\n                                     RAYMOND\n                         Um... morning, Ms. Caine.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         What did we learn about the dangers \n                         of smoking...? Give it here.\n\n               A wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette \n               with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long, \n               satisfying drag. Passes it back.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll \n                         blow your fucking head off.\n\n               Moves off through the bushes. Out of sight.\n\n               EXT. CAINE BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches, \n               face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is \n               silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off \n               and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and \n               slips inside. CUT TO:\n\n               INT. GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN - DRIVING - SAME TIME\n\n               Three GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained \n               shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly \n               and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure.\n\n                                     AGENT #1\n                         Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just \n                         to follow it back to the ass it came \n                         from.\n\n                                     AGENT #2\n                         Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast.\n\n               A RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says:\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more \n                         pass, let's make sure the house is \n                         secure.\n\n               EXT. CAITLIN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME\n\n               Charly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle \n               the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything \n               onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling.\n\n               Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS \n               (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck.\n\n               We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible, \n               the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the \n               frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns. \n               Crosses to the window, lifts the sash.\n\n               Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the \n               wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE. \n               Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down \n               the weapon. Scans though the gunsights...\n\n               POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in \n               spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church \n               lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir \n               of children, singing... CAITLIN among them.\n\n               Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes \n               shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE...\n\n               EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n               Henessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a \n               cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted \n               on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner \n               behind him...\n\n               BACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE\n\n               Watching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when \n               she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the \n               front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS \n               in rapid succession.\n\n               She's up and moving. All else forgotten.\n\n               EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n               Henessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government \n               SEDAN close behind --\n\n               The upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through. \n               Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits, \n               rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES.\n\n               Government sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over \n               the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off --\n\n               INT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - DRIVING\n\n               The driver looks over, incredulous.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         He's dead. Goddammit, how did that \n                         happen??\n\n                                     BACKSEAT\n                         *Go bulletproof, now*!\n\n               The driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that \n               is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead \n               guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate \n               exposed to the world.\n\n               BACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE\n\n               Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the \n               street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes \n               off around the house at a dead run.\n\n               INT. ST. PAUL'S - SAME TIME\n\n               Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow \n               angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up \n               just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform.\n\n               Two seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving, \n               child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE \n               has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a \n               KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're \n                         about to have 2.4 children.\n\n               Freezes her. Petrified.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         I know where you live. Close your \n                         mouth, you look like a fish. Merry \n                         Christmas.\n\n               He exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional.\n\n               MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH:\n\n               High speed chase, in progress. The driver dogs Henessey, \n               jockeys for position. Barks into a radio mic:\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Target two, acquired! Red Dog in \n                         pursuit, backup requested.\n                              (over his shoulder)\n                         You got him?\n\n                                     BACKSEAT\n                         I got him.\n\n               The backseat agent hefts an AK-47 assault rifle.\n\n               WITH HENESSEY - DRIVING\n\n               Henessey checks the rear view mirror -- just in time to see \n               a circular portion of glass POP from the chase car's window. \n               Out comes a gun muzzle.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Jesus wept.\n\n               The guy opens up on full auto. Rakes the Bronco, STRAFES it. \n               Henessey swerves madly -- no go. Death run. He's not coming \n               home, not this time.\n\n               EXT. FROZEN POND - SAME TIME\n\n               CHARLY BALTIMORE hurtles forward, SPEED SKATING across the \n               frozen pond toward the chase vehicles. Long, coltish legs, \n               to die for.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         This is gross, this is gonna be so \n                         Goddamn gross...\n\n               She goes SIDESLIPPING at superhuman speed. Tacks alongside \n               the government sedan. Targets the bald guy's head. Raises \n               the .45 and FIRES. Not to be graphic, but the car's driver \n               receives the bulk of the mess. SPRAYED.\n\n               Across the eyes. He loses control, SKIDS OUT. Catapults off \n               the road, onto the ice. Slides right toward Charly, *still \n               doing fifty*...\n\n               She doesn't miss a beat. LAUNCHES herself, twisting in \n               midair... Up OVER THE HOOD of the sedan, it blows by \n               underneath her as\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n               The incredible part. In slow motion, she does a DOUBLE AXEL \n               PIRHOUETTE. Above the hood. Mid-spin, she blows THREE SHOTS \n               through the windshield. Kills everyone. Keeps going. The car \n               spins twice around. PLOWS to a halt -- Charly hits a picture \n               perfect landing.\n\n               On the shore, HENESSEY watches, thunderstruck. Charly skates \n               by the icebound sedan. Flashes a grin at the dying driver:\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Shit... it really... *is* you...\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Phil...? Phil Krauss? I don't believe \n                         it, they moved you from cyphers. \n                         Long time, man, I figured you were \n                         dead by now.\n\n               She delivers a blow to the neck. Kills him. CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. HIGHWAY - DRIVING - DAYTIME\n\n               Henessey and Charly, driving a new vehicle: late model \n               Cadillac. Charly driver. Henessey rifles the glove \n               compartment.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         So, Mitch.

It's not your fault the gun \n                         accidentally went off in mid-air as \n                         you tripped and flew over the car.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Exactly.

You didn't have to kill \n                         him, you know.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Back off, man. Do I tell you how to \n                         snap photos of extramarital blowjobs? \n                         No.\n\n               There is a short, CHIRPING sound.

Three years \n                         old, didn't know Daddies hid in \n                         closets, not yet. Stared up at me in \n                         the strangest way... saying how'd it \n                         come to this, we were so pretty and \n                         perfect, now look at us, sinking \n                         with our head all open... Said when \n                         she grew up she was gonna teach \n                         school. She couldn't wait.\n\n               She heaves a sigh.

Leans \n               over and kisses him hard on the lips. He reacts, startled. \n               She pulls back, the oddest look on her face.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         They're gonna blow my head off, you \n                         know.\n                              (softly:)\n                         This is the last time I'll ever be \n                         pretty.\n\n               She kisses him again.

You don't like it, don't \n                         look.\n\n               She moves off toward the trees. Henessey shifts from foot to \n               foot, awkwardly.

She \n               crawls to woods' edge, peers out -- The motel stands solemn \n               and bedraggled. Draws a sharp breath -- !\n\n               There's a LIT CANDLE in the window of 17. CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - SAME TIME\n\n               A gray-suited SENTRY. Poised on a wooded slope.

Drops. \n               Before he hits, Charly's already switched from knife to gun \n               and moved on.\n\n               EXT. UNIT 17 - SAME TIME\n\n               Charly appears from the shadows. Ghosts up to the window of \n               #17 and peers in. Scans. Misses nothing. Crosses to the door, \n               taps lightly. Watches the PEEPHOLE, a tiny pinprick of light. \n               Abruptly darkened by a human eye --\n\n               She presses the silenced Beretta to the hole and fires. Sputs \n               of splinters. From behind the door, a muffled thud. She goes \n               to work on the lock.\n\n               BACK WITH HENESSEY - MINUTES HAVE PASSED\n\n               Henessey lies prone, binoculars trained on the motel.\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Christ, lady, what are you doing in \n                         there, playing fucking mah-jongg? \n                         *Move*.\n\n               Behind him, a tiny, sharp click--!

Tiny DOLL cradled in the kid's. \n               Charly runs, as the ground around her erupts like a \n               SHELLBURST.\n\n               TIMOTHY, MEANWHILE, shouting into his walkie-talkie, saying:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Take her alive, Perkins wants her!\n\n               Henessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles \n               BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters \n               beneath her...! Plunges into blackness.\n\n               INT. CELLAR - PITCH BLACK\n\n               She hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS \n               EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe \n               it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights:\n\n               She's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty \n               tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's \n               managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes \n               bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor.\n\n               Charly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick \n               wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER. \n               Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed.\n\n               A GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then.

Enough.\n\n               He points to the STEEL DOOR of the meat freezer. The guard \n               opens it onto a gleaming silver CHAMBER. Timothy calmly \n               adjusts the thermostat. Sub zero. The guard reaches for \n               Caitlin's doll... Charly snatches it back. Face etched in \n               disgust.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         You're murdering us both, cocksucker, \n                         let the kid have her fucking dolly.\n\n               He subsides, unable to meet her gaze. At which point, Timothy \n               tosses her the WOODEN BOX.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Chuck, I'm not a total creep.

Steps into the freezer, holding Caitlin. As \n               the door starts to swing shut, she says:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         It ain't over, motherfucker.

As the door erases her from view, \n               a chill dances up Timothy's spine... because there was nothing \n               resembling doubt on her face.\n\n               INT.

Without missing a beat, she crosses to the \n               STEEL DOOR. Kneels and begins DIGGING at the bottom edge. \n               CARVING into the brick, what the hell...?\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME\n\n               Henessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before \n               him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS.

CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME\n\n               CHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes. \n               Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she \n               digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy. \n               Lying flat, she appraises her work --\n\n               A TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual \n               penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two \n               seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently \n               takes the doll from her, then:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Open.\n\n               Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER.\n\n               Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels \n               down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer...\n\n               Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against \n               the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly \n               above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back:\n\n               It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through \n               the brick -- into the other ROOM.\n\n               Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll. \n               Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to \n               her. What next..?\n\n               She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH -- \n               One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...? \n               Hardly.

Atomized. THE \n               MEAT LOCKER DOOR blows inward like a cannon shot. Holds to \n               its hinges, buckled like JIFFY POP.\n\n               INT.

Then the assassin LEAVES HIS FEET, \n               look of comic surprise -- as the walls behind him disintegrate \n               in FLAME. Henessey cries out, blinded as\n\n               EXT. MOTEL BUILDING\n\n               He's blown backward OUT THE WINDOW. Chair and all, lofting \n               across the middle distance... blasts through the MOTEL SIGN. \n               Blows it to SPLINTERS. Tumbles, and over end... lands, WHAM. \n               Atop the garage's CORRUGATED ROOF. Chair flies to sticks.\n\n               A BLUE SUIT spins, startled. Gun comes up -- Henessey doesn't \n               miss a beat. Reaches between his legs. Plucks the KNIFE from \n               the wood and slings it...! Guy takes it in the head, drops. \n               Some days you get lucky.\n\n               He looks up in disbelief.

Nicked and bloodied -- ALIVE. \n               Rushes into the cavernous GARAGE, where blue-suits scuttle \n               like ants. Points to the tanker, face crazed:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Move it out of here, now!\n\n               EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - TRAVELING WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME\n\n               Caitlin in tow, SMOKE everywhere. Running flat out across \n               the compound. Eyes ticking back and forth, missing nothing... \n               Sees a gun on the ground, scoops it up: promptly DROPS IT, \n               the fucking thing's red hot.\n\n               That's when the POCK-FACED KILLER lurches out of the smoke, \n               blade arcing for her throat.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         *Run, Catey*.\n\n               She goes under the blade. SLAMS him. Down they go, hit the \n               dirt -- CAITLIN beats feet, vanishes into the smoke.\n\n               Charly, fighting for her life. Manages to KICK FREE. He rears \n               up. Poised to hurl the KNIFE. Charly, dives, rolls -- scoops \n               up the gun and SCREAMS as her flesh sizzles and it spurts \n               three times and blows him down.\n\n               Doesn't stop. Rips the AUTOMATIC RIFLE from his shoulder. \n               Rummages in his coat -- Cube of C-4. Even better. Casts about, \n               searching the smoke... No sign of her daughter.\n\n               EXT. WOODS - NIGHTTIME\n\n               CAITLIN darts in and out of the trees. Frightened. In the \n               background, men rush back and forth. The MOTEL burns merrily. \n               Then, above the shouts, A RUMBLING noise, she darts a look -- \n               as THE TANKER comes trundling out of the garage.\n\n               POV CAITLIN: Attached to the rear of the truck bed, a bright \n               yellow UTILITY BOX, roughly three by three. As the driver \n               idles, waiting for the road to clear -- Caitlin BREAKS COVER. \n               Runs and climbs inside the box, and meanwhile\n\n               BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME\n\n               Her mother. Crouched behind Timothy's RED JAGUAR. Scans \n               through the rifle's Starlight Scope. Sweating. Intense. We \n               see the landscape, cast in ghostly GREEN.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Where'd you go, baby... show Mommy...\n\n               *There*. Bingo. Charly watches through the scope as a TINY \n               GREEN CAITLIN climbs into the box and shuts the lid. \n               Unfortunately, a nearby blue-suit has WITNESSED this. He \n               looks around, stabbing a finger at the box:\n\n                                     NOSY BLUE-SUIT\n                         Hey. Hey, you see that?

Choking on woodsmoke, \n               eyes streaming. Up ahead, a splayed CORPSE -- He hunkers \n               over the poor schmuck, guy's good for a radio. Snatches up \n               the portable unit. Fumbles with the dial, searching for 26.9 \n               megahertz...\n\n               EXT. CLIFFSIDE - HIGH ABOVE MOTEL - SAME TIME\n\n               CHARLY slews to a stop in the red Jag. Leaps out. Darts along \n               the cliff, throws herself flat. Peering down at the grounds, \n               sniper rifle positioned -- Babysitting the tanker.\n\n               HEARS HENESSEY... Calling to her on the radio.\n\n                                     HENESSEY (V.O.)\n                         Charly, you there?

Building in pitch, reaching a crescendo --\n\n               A SCREAMING CHOPPER RISES BEHIND HER.\n\n               Crests the cliff and hovers like the SWORD OF DAMOCLES.\n\n               INT. CHOPPER - SAME TIME\n\n               MARKSMAN, riding shotgun. Scans the cliff below: Thick \n               evergreens. Charly, somewhere among them. He sights down his \n               rifle, takes careful aim -- BLOWS OUT TIRES on the Jaguar. \n               Cripples it. The chopper BANKS, heading away.\n\n               BACK WITH CHARLY - SAME TIME\n\n               In big trouble. MANY HEADLIGHTS, bouncing uphill toward her. \n               Cut off, they've cut her off -- The other direction ain't \n               much better: A 200 FOOT DROP. Straight down. Evergreen trees, \n               far below. Power lines. Highway.\n\n               She hears the PHONE RINGING, then... inside the Jag. Crosses \n               slowly. Reaches in, lifts the receiver. It's TIMOTHY.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY (V.O.)\n                         I tried to give you a pretty death, \n                         baby. Did my best. Now you're fucked, \n                         now it's ground beef time.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         The truck. How long til it blows?\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                              (incredulous)\n                         Sweet Loretta, you're another animal \n                         entirely. Let's see, 312 degrees... \n                         Make it ten minutes, give or take.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Then I better hurry.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Oh, spare me. You made a big noise \n                         and bought five more minutes on the \n                         planet. Give up. Die. I'll spit in \n                         what's left of your face.\n\n               He clicks off. Charly drops the receiver. Turns, looks behind: \n               They're coming for her.\n\n               Woods filled with headlights. Backlit FIGURES. Ducking in \n               and out of the trees, getting closer... The wind blows. Bitter \n               cold out here in the dark night of the soul. Nothing left. \n               No hope. No reason.\n\n               Caitlin, dead.\n\n               The rage explodes in the form of a kick which SHATTERS the \n               lock on the trunk. *Dammit*, she needs a fucking miracle.\n\n               At that moment, the trunk lid slowly rises, CREAKING... \n               Revealing all of Timothy's BUNJEE JUMPING EQUIPMENT.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - SAME TIME\n\n               The TANKER is rolling. Out onto the road, snorting and \n               belching. Preceded by the Little Debbie PANEL TRUCK.\n\n               INT. UTILITY BOX - ON TANKER - SAME TIME\n\n               Poor little Caitlin huddles in the dark. All alone. ROARING \n               in her ears. Sort of like being underwater.\n\n               EXT. TANKER TRUCK - CLOSE ON UNDERBELLY\n\n               A silver device attached to the skin of the tank.\n\n               WITH TIMOTHY - CROSSING THE SMOKE-FILLED GROUNDS\n\n               He consults a tiny, liquid crystal display on his watch. Red \n               numerals. *178 degrees*.\n\n               EXT. CLIFF'S EDGE - WITH CHARLY\n\n               She won't quit. Busy now, deftly sticking the wad of C-4 \n               EXPLOSIVE to the bottom of the Jaguar. Straightens. Turns \n               around --\n\n               Stands dead calm as they all come out of the TREES, guns \n               drawn... Raises her hands, see, boys...? No bang-bang.\n\n               Like backlit monsters, they approach, hulking. Matter of \n               yards, now... She flashes a naughty little smile --\n\n               Goes backward off the cliff and rockets earthward.\n\n               200 feet of open air, THE BUNJEE Cord pays out, fast...! \n               Whipsaws out the door of the Jaguar, hooked by carabiner to \n               the STEERING COLUMN and meanwhile\n\n               THE CHAPTER AGENTS\n\n               Rush forward, incredulous. Peer OVER THE EDGE: Below them, a \n               swan diver, BLACKNESS all around. She drops like a stone. \n               Vanishes into the fog, beautiful as a poem.\n\n               INSIDE THE JAGUAR: The cord goes taut -- Now it starts to \n               stretch outward. DECELERATION kicking in, Charly can FEEL \n               it, still whistling through space...\n\n               Hits a dead stop.\n\n               This is it. Cord, stretched as far as it goes.\n\n               She's still sixty feet above the highway.\n\n               No hesitation whatsoever. She thumbs the DETONATOR in her \n               right fist --\n\n               Blows the car.\n\n               UP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE\n\n               The Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge \n               of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS.\n\n               BACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING\n\n               Lifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does \n               thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand --\n\n               Slaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward \n               until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop.\n\n               Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty \n               feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN \n               ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver \n               SWEARS.\n\n               She raises her gun. Fires without blinking.\n\n               Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER \n               ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as\n\n               CHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR\n\n               Crosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING \n               JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed \n               by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another. \n               She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of \n               her tires on the road behind her.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - TOWN OF SANTA CLAUS - CHRISTMAS EVE\n\n               Milling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING \n               PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay \n               of the film's opening, as\n\n               EXT. STREET - SAME TIME\n\n               The gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point: \n               the innocuous PANEL TRUCK.\n\n               The temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME TIME\n\n               Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE \n               in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox. \n               Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the \n               car, gun held low, and meanwhile --\n\n               INT.

Drive.\n\n               The rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt. \n               Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as\n\n               INT. PLUSH LIMO - SAME TIME\n\n               MR.

HIGHWAY - HEADING OUT OF TOWN\n\n               SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves \n               in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the \n               other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance, \n               and meanwhile\n\n               TWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS\n\n               Come whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them.

In five seconds I'm gonna own \n                         that fucking truck.\n\n               Santa complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT \n               chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the \n               government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST \n               of them. It's what she wanted.\n\n               *FIVE SECONDS*:\n\n               Charly Baltimore LEAPS from the sleigh, lands atop the \n               government car. Skips lightly across it, casually BLOWS TWO \n               SHOTS through the ROOF. Down through the metal. Drilling \n               into their heads. Driver and passenger, killed instantly --\n\n               As Charly hops nimbly from her 50 mile-an-hour STEPPING STONE. \n               Over to the tanker. Dump-stuffs a new clip, as\n\n               THE CORPSE CAR\n\n               Fades from the race, driverless. Whipping out of control. \n               FISHTAILS away behind them -- Takes out the SECOND CHASE \n               CAR, spray of metal.\n\n               Three seconds, and Charly's taken out two pursuers.\n\n               INT. CAB OF TANKER TRUCK - SAME TIME\n\n               The door files open and the DRIVER sees CHARLY. Bloody. \n               Demonic. Wisely leaps out, BOUNCES from view -- Charly snags \n               his hat as he goes by, plops it on her head. SWINGS UP into \n               the drivers' seat, double-clutches -- pours on the steam.\n\n               Five seconds. She owns the tanker.\n\n               BLASTS forward into the lead PANEL TRUCK. Slams the truck \n               from behind, BULLDOZES it -- Sends it THUNDERING into a park \n               bench. Glass sprays.\n\n               She owns the road. On the seat beside her: an MP-5 machine \n               gun. She's set. Throws a NINETY DEGREE turn onto a sidestreet. \n               Donates most of her tires to New York.\n\n               INT. SPEEDING TANKER TRUCK - SANTA CLAUS - NIGHT\n\n               Charly's on fire. Senses heightened. Eyes tick back and forth \n               like a machine.

Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him. \n               Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*.\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         Call it four minutes to detonation. \n                         I got a chopper on the way, lots of \n                         time.\n\n               He sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE. \n               Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Oh, honey.

Adopts \n               a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand.\n\n               INT.

She SAILS through \n               space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers \n               forward.

Avoids a stab at her throat, eats \n               that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right \n               hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her \n               wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back \n               GASPING.\n\n               Circling again.

She ducks, trips on purpose and \n               HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate --\n\n               And WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him \n               in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the \n               bastard's KNEE, wide open...\n\n               Boot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in \n               agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister --\n\n               Grabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--!\n\n               Charly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder \n               and flings it.\n\n               Takes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up \n               and over, flailing...! Drops from sight.\n\n               Charly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs \n               splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God...\n\n               There's a hole in her chest.\n\n               EXT. SEMINARY - NIGHTTIME\n\n               The doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe. \n               Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid. \n               Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts.\n\n               THE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD\n\n               The PILOT brandishes his radio mic:\n\n                                     PILOT\n                         Got her. Heading for the tanker, \n                         thirty yards out. She's all over the \n                         place, something's wrong with her.\n\n               WITH CHARLY\n\n               Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a \n               straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the \n               inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         *Cover your ears*.\n\n               She raises her gun. Fires. BAM-! Lock springs to pieces. \n               CAITLIN tumbles to the pavement, dazed and confused. Casts \n               about --\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         MOMMY...!\n\n               She springs to her feet. Comes running and flings both arms \n               around her mother. HUGS HER -- That one puts Charly out for \n               a few seconds. PAIN, excruciating. Comes to her senses, \n               swaying like a clothesline in a high wind...\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Run... get out...\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Don't go away again, Please...!\n\n               Charly grabs Caitlin's head. Turns it. Facing the TEMPERATURE \n               GAUGE. Red numerals: *301 degrees*.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         The truck's a bomb... gonna blow up, \n                         RUN... I'm right behind you, go...\n\n               Caitlin hovers, torn.

RUNS, toward the surrounding \n               woods... Charly watches her go. Nods, satisfied -- Collapses. \n               Hits the tarmac and splays in a heap. Breath wheezing in and \n               out. Already the pavement is staining red.\n\n               WITH CAITLIN\n\n               As, within ten seconds of the command, she promptly DISOBEYS \n               her mother, looks back -- Stops dead.\n\n               There's a corpse underneath the truck.\n\n               It isn't moving. It isn't breathing. It isn't laughing or \n               crying...\n\n               Or hurting, not anymore.\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         *Mommy, no...*!\n\n               Bomb forgotten. Danger forgotten. Her tiny arms pumping, \n               feet slapping pavement -- She returns to her mother. Grabs \n               one knife-bloodied shoulder, oblivious of the wound. Jerks \n               back and forth. Frenzied.\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         It's okay.

At the edge of the \n               parking lot. 100 yards away, give or take. Numerous SEDANS. \n               The Little Debbie panel truck.

SEMINARY - SAME TIME\n\n               The side door BURSTS OUTWARD and a limping figure emerges, \n               frantically signaling for the chopper: TIMOTHY'S got murder \n               in his eye.

Looking small and \n               terrified. Whispers in her mother's ear. Soft and low:\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Mommy, get up now.

One \n               fingernail, then. Scratches feebly. Toes, shifting. Seeking \n               purchase. A HAND, planting itself... TEETH BARED, a rictus \n               of pain... Rising up...\n\n               *Standing*. Full height now, flexing one deadly arm.

Charly gasps for \n               breath. Cracks open the GUN... no bullets. Swell. Scans the \n               pavement... There. THE MP-5 machine gun lies twenty feet \n               from her. Twenty miles, same difference. Across the pavement, \n               even farther away: Timothy's car.\n\n               *305 degrees*.

Chopper again, SCREAMING in low \n               and fast --\n\n               CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and \n               falls flat on her back, points it skyward:\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Suck on it.\n\n               She fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches \n               to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing.\n\n               Head over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on \n               the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees \n               Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, \n               SHRIEKING--!\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Die screaming, motherfucker.\n\n               She watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS \n               now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody \n               in the moonlight...\n\n               HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the \n               metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen \n               squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning.\n\n               Henessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...! \n               KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the \n               car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says:\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Hurry! The truck is a bomb!\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a \n                         fucking lightning rod on the roof...? \n                         No, Caitlin, *don't check*.\n\n               He PEELS OUT.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Hey... you're bleeding...\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         I think that's yours...\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Right, sorry...\n\n               He inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly.\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         *You're a bad driver! Who said you \n                         could drive*?\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME\n\n               They have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS \n               as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and \n               hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming:\n\n                                     TIMOTHY\n                         *Somebody do her, somebody kill that \n                         fucking whore, kill her*!\n\n               That's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything \n               but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches \n               pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown \n               like rockets in every direction.\n\n               TIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the \n               windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the \n               BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out \n               of control...\n\n               Strikes the tanker. Boom.\n\n               Imagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a \n               craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS.\n\n               EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME\n\n               Henessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as \n               the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his \n               way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods \n               as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into \n               and out of the trees, peekaboo...\n\n               Some go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors, \n               GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams:\n\n                                     CAITLIN\n                         Don't hit the cars!\n\n               Henessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and \n               sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete...\n\n               Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway \n               and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING \n               fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement.\n\n               OVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods \n               and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St. \n               Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME\n\n               Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays \n               his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                              (grimaces)\n                         ...Are you... stupid...?\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         ...funny thing...? You aren't going \n                         to die... I am...\n\n               Charly offers him that soft, sad little smile.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         I know.\n\n               Henessey starts to fade... breathing labored... Reaches up... \n               strokes Caitlin's hair. Smiles at her:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Hey, gorgeous... know something... \n                         you got your mother's eyes... don't \n                         let... nobody tell you different...\n\n               Slumps back in the seat. Gazing at Charly. A single tear \n               runs from one bloodshot eye. He whispers:\n\n                                     HENESSEY\n                         Scared... to be nobody... without a \n                         ripple... please... remember me...\n                              (beat)\n                         ...Love you...\n\n               Dies.\n\n               Charly leans on the dash. Cries for awhile. For herself... \n               for Henessey... for this Godawful planet, and everything \n               else. DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n               A MOTHER SITS in the glow of a Winnie the Pooh nightlight. \n               Next to her sleeping daughter's bed -- back to the very \n               beginning of the film, it's been a long kiss goodnight.\n\n               An elderly FARMER pokes his head in. She doesn't look up.\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         Um, Ma'am...? Ambulance is here. \n                         They'll be right in.\n\n               The shadowy figure nods... Remains seated. Stays awhile in \n               the dark. Keeping vigil. Snow slithers against the glass.\n\n                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. PALATIAL GEORGETOWN ESTATE - EARLY MORNING\n\n               MR.

Stands, \n               twenty yards downrange. Beretta leveled at both of them.\n\n               Two months, you barely notice the limp. She stands there in \n               sleeveless top and short skirt and looks like a million. \n               Thumbs a metal box, click-! A red ARMING LIGHT blinks on.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         Good morning, I'm Charly. The slab \n                         you're standing on is actually a \n                         land mine.

Tosses him a cellular phone -- He \n               catches it as though it were a live snake.\n\n                                     CHARLY\n                         My terms are these.

DIALS.\n\n               Charly takes a deep breath. Scans the flowers, face placid. \n               It's really quite lovely today. Maybe she'll start a garden.\n\n               Perkins clicks off. Look at Charly:\n\n                                     PERKINS\n                         It's done.

Shifts her aim and shoots the other guy.\n\n               Perkins' eyes WIDEN in sudden realization. He LUNGES forward, \n               grabs the aide, holding him up... desperately propping his \n               dead weight atop the land mine...\n\n                                     PERKINS\n                         Goddamn you, I can't hold him...
