Smaller corollary \n               of the wheel outside. Mounted on the same axis.\n\n               SAMANTHA is tied to that wheel.

Strapped to the wheel, wearing \n               only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.\n\n               THE MAN KNOWN AS DAEDALUS (AKA Luke) stands before her, giving \n               instructions to the ubiquitous TIMOTHY.

A \n               shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he \n               knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what \n               the hell...? He pokes them.

Caitlin is \n               in the yard, chasing a big floppy-eared Labrador.\n\n               On the porch, a CRICKET chirps. HAL comes out, sits beside \n               his wife CHARLY as she finishes eating.

The dog parades up to Caitlin \n               with a stick in its jaws. A farm truck goes by, a faraway \n               speck.\n\n               Charly absent-mindedly rolls a steak knife in her fingers. \n               Eyes far away.\n\n               It never occurs to her what she's done until the chirping \n               stops.\n\n               Ten feet away, the knife quivers.\n\n<b>               FADE OUT.
