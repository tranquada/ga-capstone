Some of\r\n                 them went home quite disturbed, and we\r\n                 got some angry calls from parents.\r\n\r\n                           MATT\r\n                 Yeah, she's sort of been going to town\r\n                 with the whole picture-taking thing,\r\n                 but I had no idea --\r\n\r\n                           MS.

It's\r\n                  Scottie. She's been texting some awful\r\n                  things to Lani, and I'd like her to\r\n                  stop.\r\n\r\n                            MATT\r\n                  For instance.\r\n\r\n                            BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)\r\n                  Here's the latest one. \"We all know\r\n                  you grew pubes over the summer.\" She\r\n                  sends little messages like that for no\r\n                  reason. She even wrote it on Lani's\r\n                  Facebook wall.\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                  Huh.\r\n\r\n                            BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)\r\n                  She calls my daughter Lanikai, implying\r\n                  she's like the size of an entire\r\n                  neighborhood. Do you think that's\r\n                  nice?\r\n\r\n                            MATT\r\n                  That's not like her at all.       She's\r\n                  usually very sweet.\r\n\r\n     He glances out the window at Scottie, who sits on the ground,\r\n     back turned, POUNDING something with a BIG ROCK.\r\n\r\n                            MATT (CONT'D)\r\n                  As you may know, her mother isn't well,\r\n                  and maybe this is how she's dealing\r\n                  with it.\r\n\r\n                            BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)\r\n                  I don't care about the backstory, Mr.\r\n                  King.

I'm very sorry.\r\n\r\n                            BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)\r\n                  Scottie should be the one who's sorry.\r\n                  I want her to come over and apologize\r\n                  to Lani, and I don't ever want her to\r\n                  write to my daughter again.\r\n\r\n                            LANI (DISTANT O.S.)\r\n                  She can in a good way.\r\n\r\n                            BARB HIGGINS (O.S.)\r\n                  If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to\r\n                  tell the headmaster. You can't buy\r\n                  your way out of this.\r\n\r\n     Matt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything else\r\n     weren't enough already.\r\n\r\n                            MATT (V.O.)\r\n                  See what I mean? Everybody sees me as\r\n                  the rich guy, the inheritor. People\r\n                  resent us. I resent us. Even our last\r\n                  name -- King. How irritating.\r\n\r\n18   INT.

They make her\r\n                  laugh, and then she shows Megan and\r\n                  Brooke, and they laugh too.\r\n\r\n                            MATT\r\n                  I should have known Reina had something\r\n                  to do with it.

Can she?\r\n\r\n                            MATT\r\n                  We'll make a deal. You apologize to\r\n                  this girl, and you talk to your mother,\r\n                  and then we'll see about Reina dropping\r\n                  by the hospital.

Between his land\r\n                  deals and her huge inheritance, all of\r\n                  their descendants for generations have\r\n                  watched the past unfurl millions into\r\n                  our laps through leases and sales. Now\r\n                  the Rule Against Perpetuities is\r\n                  forcing us to dissolve the trust, and\r\n                  we're selling the last parcel of\r\n                  undeveloped land.\r\n\r\n     Matt looks up, his glance falling on the portraits of Edward\r\n     and Margaret.\r\n\r\n                            MATT (V.O.)

I\r\n               thought that was an encouraging sign.\r\n\r\n     Scottie looks up hopefully.

But then the accident\r\n                  happened, and I was waiting until she\r\n                  woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't\r\n                  even suspect.

Around\r\n      her BALLOONS droop, FLOWERS wilt, get-well CARDS lie in a\r\n      pile. Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping.

HERMAN (CONT'D)\r\n                   That's right. It's an octopus. Such a\r\n                   funny creature with its eight legs.\r\n                   But did you know octopi are actually\r\n                   extremely intelligent, like dogs and\r\n                   cats? They have unique personalities,\r\n                   and just like us they have a lot of\r\n                   defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know\r\n                   about the ink sac. She uses ink to\r\n                   confuse her predators. She can\r\n                   camouflage herself. She can emit\r\n                   poison, and some can mimic more\r\n                   dangerous creatures, like the eel. I\r\n                   keep her to remind me of our defense\r\n                   mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage,\r\n                   our poison, all the things we use to\r\n                   keep away hurt. The reason Dr.\r\n                   Johnston invited me here today is to\r\n                   meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot\r\n                   about you.\r\n\r\n                                SCOTTIE\r\n                   Like what?\r\n\r\n                             DR.

HERMAN\r\n                   You're going to have to be a very brave\r\n                   girl right now, and you're surrounded\r\n                   by people who love you. I came to meet\r\n                   you and tell you that if you ever want\r\n                   to talk about what you're feeling, I\r\n                   would like to talk to you too. I can\r\n                   help you face what's going on without\r\n                   all the silly defense mechanisms that\r\n                   work for an octopus but not for us.\r\n\r\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                    99.\r\n       The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n114   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   114\r\n\r\n                            DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                Okay.    Thank you, Dr. Herman.\r\n\r\n      Dr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before\r\n      leaving. Scottie is left holding the octopus. She drops it,\r\n      and it squeaks a little.\r\n\r\n                          ALEXANDRA\r\n                What the fuck was that?\r\n\r\n                          DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                Yes, well, they say she's very good one-\r\n                on-one.\r\n\r\n                          SCOTTIE\r\n                So Mom's going to die for sure?\r\n\r\n                          DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                Yes. We worked really hard with her,\r\n                but three other doctors and I agree\r\n                she's in what we call an irreversible\r\n                coma. Do you know what that means?\r\n\r\n                          SCOTTIE\r\n                It means she doesn't have a brain\r\n                anymore.\r\n\r\n                          DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                Not exactly, but... yes, that's the\r\n                general idea. So we're doing exactly\r\n                what she wanted us to do if that ever\r\n                happened. That's why she's not\r\n                attached to the machines anymore.\r\n\r\n                          ALEXANDRA\r\n                It's for the best, Scottie. Look at\r\n                her. She's not happy like this.\r\n\r\n                          DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                The purpose of medicine is to heal, and\r\n                we can't do that now.\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                Do you understand?\r\n\r\n                             SCOTTIE\r\n                Yes.     What will we do with her body?\r\n\r\n      Dr. Johnston looks to Matt for this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                    100.\r\n       The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n114   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    114\r\n\r\n                           MATT\r\n                 First Mom's going to give some of her\r\n                 organs to other sick people, so she can\r\n                 help save their lives. That's a really\r\n                 neat thing she's doing. Then we're\r\n                 going to... we're going to scatter her\r\n                 ashes in the ocean. You know how Mom\r\n                 always loved the ocean.\r\n\r\n                              SCOTTIE\r\n                 Her ashes?\r\n\r\n      Scottie looks at her mother, picturing her as ashes.\r\n\r\n                           SCOTTIE (CONT'D)\r\n                 When will she die?\r\n\r\n                           DR. JOHNSTON\r\n                 Any day now, I'm afraid.       But you still\r\n                 have some time.\r\n\r\n                            DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D)\r\n                 Well.

Scottie is in a\r\n      sort of trance.\r\n\r\n                           ALEXANDRA\r\n                 Come here, Scottie.\r\n\r\n      Scottie goes to her sister, who takes her in her arms.\r\n\r\n                           SCOTTIE\r\n                 Do eyeballs burn?\r\n\r\n                            SID\r\n                 Hey, Scottie.

She's a fighter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                   105.\r\n      The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n122   CONTINUED:                                                       122\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   No. She's dying.    We took her off the\r\n                   machines.\r\n\r\n      LATER --\r\n\r\n      Matt, Hugh and Six FINISH THE COUNT while others mill about,\r\n      mingle, drink -- an early celebration for all except for a\r\n      group of DISSENTERS off to one side.\r\n\r\n                             COUSIN HUGH\r\n                   Well, no surprise. Other than the\r\n                   holdouts who don't want to sell at all,\r\n                   it's Don Holitzer. Chicago group a\r\n                   distant second. Feels good.\r\n                   We're doing the right thing, Mattie.\r\n                   At least there ain't going to be any\r\n                   Wal-Mart. Now it's your call, and\r\n                   we're all behind you, most of us\r\n                   anyway.\r\n                       (handing him a pen)\r\n                   Go ahead, Captain. Make it official.\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   It's strange, that's all.\r\n\r\n                             COUSIN HUGH\r\n                   What's strange?\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   We didn't do anything to own that land.\r\n                   It was entrusted to us. And now we're\r\n                   just...\r\n\r\n      Hugh and Six exchange a concerned look.      For a moment we go\r\n      VERY CLOSE on Matt's eyes. Then --\r\n\r\n                             MATT (CONT'D)\r\n                   I can't do it. I won't do it.     I'm not\r\n                   going to sign.\r\n\r\n                             COUSIN HUGH\r\n                   What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we\r\n                   know you have a lot on your plate right\r\n                   now, but you're not going to fuck this\r\n                   up for us. It's over. If we don't\r\n                   sell now, it'll be a mess when the\r\n                   trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your\r\n                   wife, done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                    105A.\r\n      The Descendants      PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n122   CONTINUED: (2)                                                     122\r\n\r\n                            COUSIN   SIX\r\n                  It's inevitable,   Matt. You know that.\r\n                  We'll get out of   debt -- the taxes and\r\n                  maintenance have   been leaching us for\r\n                  far too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                106.\r\n      The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n122   CONTINUED: (3)                                                122\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I\r\n                don't want it to go to anyone. I want\r\n                to keep it.\r\n\r\n                          COUSIN SIX\r\n                For Christ's sake. We can't move\r\n                without your approval. And we don't\r\n                want to.\r\n\r\n      Hugh tries forcing Matt's hand.   Matt resists.\r\n\r\n                          COUSIN HUGH\r\n                Your head's not right, Mattie. Your\r\n                head's not right. You want a couple\r\n                days to think it over? Take a couple\r\n                days.\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                I don't need a couple days. I have the\r\n                authority, and this is what I want. I\r\n                haven't wanted something in a long\r\n                time. We have other businesses we're\r\n                converting to corporations. We can\r\n                figure it out.\r\n\r\n                          COUSIN SIX\r\n                But it's utterly unproductive land. It\r\n                doesn't generate enough income to pay\r\n                the goddamn taxes.\r\n\r\n                          COUSIN HUGH\r\n                You're the trustee. You know better\r\n                than anyone we only have seven years\r\n                left.\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                Then I have seven years to figure out\r\n                how to keep it.\r\n\r\n      Cousin Hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then\r\n      back at Matt.\r\n\r\n                          COUSIN HUGH\r\n                We'll come after you. Just because\r\n                you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest\r\n                of us would be afraid to come after\r\n                you. But nobody wants to do that.\r\n                We're family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                  107.\r\n       The Descendants      PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n122   CONTINUED: (4)                                                  122\r\n\r\n                           MATT\r\n                 People will be relieved, Hugh, the\r\n                 whole state. I sign that document,\r\n                 it's over. End of the line. Something\r\n                 that was ours to protect will be gone.\r\n                 Even though we're haole as shit and go\r\n                 to private schools and clubs and can't\r\n                 even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian,\r\n                 we still carry Hawaiian blood, and\r\n                 we're still tied to this land. And our\r\n                 children are tied to this land. It's a\r\n                 miracle that for whatever bullshit\r\n                 reason 150 years ago, we own this much\r\n                 of... paradise, but we do. And for\r\n                 whatever bullshit reason now, I'm the\r\n                 trustee. And I'm not signing. And if\r\n                 you sue me, it'll only make us closer.\r\n\r\n      Cousin Hugh releases a long breath more like a belch, quickly\r\n      picks his nose, exchanges a look with Cousin Six. Then he\r\n      brings his fingers to his mouth to WHISTLE.\r\n\r\n                           COUSIN HUGH\r\n                 All right, everybody, listen up.\r\n                 Cousin Mattie has an announcement.     Get\r\n                 ready.\r\n\r\n      Rising to his feet, Matt scans the faces of his relatives.\r\n\r\n123   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          123\r\n\r\n      From the way Matt, Sid and the girls are positioned around\r\n      the room, we can tell their presence there is now way of\r\n      life. Scottie snoozes on the little sofa. We may notice\r\n      that Elizabeth is even more shrunken.\r\n\r\n      A KNOCK is followed by --\r\n\r\n      A VASE OF FLOWERS\r\n      appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by\r\n      thin bronzed arms. It's JULIE SPEER.\r\n\r\n                            MATT\r\n                 Julie.   What are you doing here?\r\n\r\n      He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers.        She\r\n      nods to the girls.\r\n\r\n                           JULIE\r\n                 I know we just met, but I was thinking\r\n                 about you guys these past few days, and\r\n                 I knew your mom was here. I don't\r\n                 know. I just felt I should stop by.\r\n\r\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                   108.\r\n      The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft\r\n123   CONTINUED:                                                       123\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   You remember Alex.

But I know a lot\r\n                   about her.\r\n\r\n      As they now do often, Matt and Alex exchange a look.\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   Well, we appreciate your coming by.\r\n                   The flowers are lovely.\r\n\r\n                              SID\r\n                       (heading to the door)\r\n                   Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the\r\n                   cafeteria.\r\n\r\n      The girls follow Sid's prompt, leaving Matt alone with Julie,\r\n      standing, a dying woman between them.\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know\r\n                   about my wife's condition, but she's\r\n                   going to die very soon.

Because I\r\n                   know. I came because my husband\r\n                   wouldn't. And that just didn't seem\r\n                   right. I thought someone from my\r\n                   family should come.\r\n\r\n      Wow.\r\n\r\n                             MATT\r\n                   I'm sorry I came to your house like\r\n                   that.

We've\r\n                been going crazy ever since. Not easy\r\n                with the kids around. It's all\r\n                something I never could have imagined.\r\n                And then your family's decision about\r\n                the land. I think you're doing the\r\n                right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's\r\n                all so complicated and confusing.\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                I know.\r\n\r\n                          JULIE\r\n                Brian told me everything. Well, how\r\n                can I ever know it's everything? When\r\n                did you find out? Have you known for a\r\n                while?\r\n\r\n                          MATT\r\n                Just a few days ago.\r\n\r\n                          JULIE\r\n                I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry.    I\r\n                can't imagine what you're going\r\n                through. Do you mind if I say\r\n                something to her?\r\n\r\n      Matt is unsure but what else can he do?

Alex and Sid -- who've\r\n      clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away,\r\n      unnoticed by Matt and Julie.\r\n\r\n                           MATT (CONT'D)\r\n                 He didn't love her.

At the door, she looks at Matt.\r\n      Matt looks at her. She leaves.\r\n\r\n      Matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly\r\n      that this is his moment.\r\n\r\n      He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her\r\n      hair. He says something to her as though silently praying,\r\n      then realizes he should say it aloud.\r\n\r\n      He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach.\r\n\r\n                           MATT\r\n                 Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love,\r\n                 my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye.\r\n                 Goodbye. Goodbye.\r\n\r\n124   INT.

She walks slowly toward --\r\n\r\n      A NEARBY WAITING AREA\r\n\r\n      -- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid. Matt and Sid rise\r\n      to comfort her, but she's not in the mood. She allows them\r\n      each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie.\r\n\r\n      Signaling to Matt to let her do this, Alex escorts a fearful\r\n      Scottie toward Elizabeth's room, and, reassuring her, guides\r\n      her little sister inside.\r\n\r\n      Matt and Sid are left alone.\r\n\r\n125   EXT.
