He moves to his window and looks down at\r\n     Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is\r\n     crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.\r\n\r\n     Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.\r\n\r\n<b>                         MOTHER (V.O.)\r\n</b>               Hey, look who's here...\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                                                         FLASHBACK TO:\r\n</b>\r\n<b>31   INT.

He's alone at the wall, dressed in his\r\n     Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.\r\n\r\n     Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As\r\n     happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the\r\n     right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.\r\n\r\n     After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam\r\n     and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of\r\n     \"Come On, Eileen\" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.\r\n\r\n<b>                         SAM\r\n</b>               Oh, my God.

It starts\r\n     slow. \"So over it\" hand moves. A little shoulder. And\r\n     then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.\r\n\r\n     Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to\r\n     look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.\r\n     He bobs his head like a dork.
