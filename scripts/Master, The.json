A digression\r\n          into the under constructed sewer system.\r\n          It was here that I could no be found - or\r\n          so my thinking went. All my confidence\r\n          and all my arrogance was brought upon me.\r\n          Full in the face.

I have no quarrel with man's\r\n          belief's, but religions in general can be\r\n          pre-occupied with a God or Idol or\r\n          something of some such nature who is\r\n          merely trying to fill the universe with a\r\n          lot of little replicas of himself - we\r\n          are trying to free the individual - not\r\n          bend to a will of a God, you see. And if\r\n          our teachings can reconcile these views\r\n          it would be doing a great service to\r\n\r\n                         MANKIND -\r\n\r\n                         JOHN MORE\r\n          Do you think it can?\r\n\r\n                         MASTER\r\n          I not only think it can, I know it does.\r\n\r\n                         JOHN MORE\r\n          You mentioned 'good science' and what it\r\n          does.. .but doesn't that, by definition,\r\n          allow for more than one opinion?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n                         MASTER\r\n          Indeed, indeed.
