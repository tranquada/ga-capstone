Dozens of Yakuza look on as\r\n    the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to\r\n    expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.\r\n\r\n    HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first\r\n    tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.\r\n\r\n    He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.\r\n\r\n                            HOLLYWOOD\r\n              Watch it, old man!\r\n\r\n    The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.

The panicked screams of the fleeing\r\n    entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles\r\n    of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are\r\n    eviscerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\r\n                     GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08    5.\r\n1   CONTINUED: (4)                                             1\r\n\r\n    There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The\r\n    whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams.\r\n    Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.\r\n\r\n    STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in\r\n    the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window.\r\n    Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.\r\n\r\n    Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate\r\n    BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who\r\n    looks up --\r\n\r\n    -- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone\r\n    else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The\r\n    figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the\r\n    first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.\r\n\r\n                            HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)\r\n              Listen... you don't have to do\r\n              this! Whatever you're getting\r\n              paid, I'll triple it! You hear me!\r\n              I'll pay you whatever you want!\r\n              Just name your price!\r\n\r\n    Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby.\r\n    With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air\r\n    as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.\r\n\r\n    There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed\r\n    hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.\r\n\r\n    The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it\r\n    were barely there, coming out the other side as --\r\n\r\n    -- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces,\r\n    splattering the artist with blood.\r\n\r\n    The match touches the floor and goes out.\r\n\r\n    The Tattoo Master does not move, has not moved.    Frozen.\r\n\r\n                            TATTOO ARTIST\r\n              But you are real, aren't you?\r\n\r\n    After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the\r\n    way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the\r\n    dark to inspect its kill.\r\n\r\n    The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart\r\n    pounding in his ears.\r\n\r\n                            TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)\r\n              For fifty-seven-years, I've told\r\n              your story...\r\n                            (MORE)\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\n                     GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08    6.\r\n1   CONTINUED: (5)                                             1\r\n                            TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)\r\n              No one ever believed\r\n              me.\r\n\r\n    The ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless.

The\r\n    artist closes his eyes, anticipating death.\r\n\r\n    Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come.\r\n    He finally forces himself to open his eyes.\r\n\r\n    The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he\r\n    came, leaving death and blood in his wake.\r\n\r\n                                                        CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n2   INT.

The prosecutor\r\n                  questioned him about a payment of\r\n                  100 pounds of gold. Shigeaki\r\n                  answered that he didn't know what\r\n                  the prosecutor was talking about.\r\n                  The question was never brought up\r\n                  again. But what pinged for me was\r\n                  the amount- the exact same amount\r\n                  rumored to be paid to the Hattori\r\n                  Clan for the assassination of Lord\r\n                  Sanda.\r\n\r\n                                MASLOW\r\n                  So you start to wonder, in this\r\n                  ever changing world, if the cost\r\n                  of a man's life has remained\r\n                  constant.\r\n\r\n                                MIKA\r\n                  Exactly.

The floor beneath his bare feet is made of\r\n      thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood\r\n      laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not,\r\n      however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong\r\n      move will make them shift noisily.\r\n\r\n      This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor.\r\n\r\n                                 OZUNU\r\n                   Suffering exists only because                       *\r\n                   weakness exists.\r\n\r\n      Ozunu watches from the far side of the room as Raizo\r\n      takes his first step. Carefully. Graceful as any\r\n      dancer.\r\n\r\n      He makes no sound.\r\n\r\n                                 OZUNU (CONT'D)\r\n                   You must hate all weakness.

Each soft as a\r\n      falling feather.\r\n\r\n      He is a third of the way across the floor - his body\r\n      gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor\r\n      sings beneath him.\r\n\r\n      Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he\r\n      subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending\r\n      foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches.\r\n\r\n      Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod.      Slashing\r\n      blows that leave deep cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                   GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   18A.\r\n18   CONTINUED:                                              18\r\n\r\n     Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his\r\n     place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise,\r\n     and leaving no trace of his passage...\r\n\r\n     ...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints.\r\n\r\n\r\n19   FLASHBACK - INT.

Then, as if coming to an\r\n     inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into\r\n     which a thick salve has been folded. She crosses the few\r\n     feet to Raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony,\r\n     she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down --\r\n\r\n     -- and begins applying the salve to his feet. Within\r\n     moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes. Finishing\r\n     quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the\r\n     leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with Raizo, then\r\n     heads back for her mat.\r\n\r\n     He lays there for a BEAT, confused as to whether his\r\n     diminishing pain is a good thing. Then he turns to look\r\n     at Kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently\r\n     asleep.\r\n\r\n     He regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over\r\n     himself to sleep as we come around to --\r\n\r\n     -- the other side of Kiriko, and see that she is very\r\n     much awake, almost smiling. She closes her eyes.\r\n\r\n                                                           CUT TO:\r\n\r\n\r\n20   INT.

She\r\n      doesn't move, doesn't breathe.\r\n\r\n      She forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her\r\n      bed for a cricket bat. A car drives by outside. Could\r\n      be nothing. Could be everything.\r\n\r\n      Despite her fear, she edges toward the door. Slowly\r\n      peers around it.

Every shadow\r\n      could conceal unseen eyes.\r\n\r\n      She comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead\r\n      light is out. She flicks the switch on and off.\r\n      Nothing. She reaches carefully toward the light bulb.\r\n      Taps it. The bulb rattles, it's just burned out. She\r\n      breathes a sigh of relief. Then she notices --\r\n\r\n      -- that the living room window is open, the blinds gently\r\n      swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash.\r\n\r\n      She closes it and locks it. Looks to her desk,\r\n      concerned. Did she leave the window open? Or is\r\n      something going on.\r\n\r\n      She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something.\r\n      She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. Pulls out\r\n      the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think\r\n      to check.\r\n\r\n      She unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked DVD in a\r\n      slim plastic case. Relieved, she starts to put it\r\n      away...then stops. Is it the same DVD? She moves OS.\r\n\r\n      MOMENTS LATER... the TV is switched on, and an image\r\n      begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera,\r\n      recording an urban street corner in Japan. The tape is\r\n      riddled with digital noise and artifacting.\r\n\r\n      Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to\r\n      grow shapes.

This time, as Takeshi comes\r\n     at him, everything becomes clear.\r\n\r\n     The whistle of the blade.\r\n\r\n     The zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat.\r\n\r\n     The sound of his robe.\r\n\r\n     Combined with Takeshi's unmistakable body odor Raizo has\r\n     everything he needs to dodge, slip and counter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                         GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   32.\r\n34   CONTINUED:                                                   34\r\n\r\n     His chain strikes, wrapping an ankle, throwing a stunned\r\n     Takeshi to the wall.\r\n\r\n     Kiriko tries to hide her smile.\r\n\r\n     Ozunu nods in appreciation.\r\n\r\n     Raizo nods back, as if he can see without eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n35   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT                 35\r\n\r\n     Young Raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. Trying to\r\n     sleep, but it's impossible. Takeshi's snoring doesn't\r\n     help.\r\n\r\n     He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and\r\n     falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of\r\n     sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync\r\n     with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him.\r\n\r\n     Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until\r\n     only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the\r\n     slight murmur of their hearts.\r\n\r\n     Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he\r\n     cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat\r\n     faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips.\r\n\r\n     They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier,\r\n     the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster.\r\n\r\n     Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting\r\n     her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against\r\n     the blanket-\r\n\r\n     It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo.\r\n\r\n     Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump their hearts growing\r\n     louder and louder as they become-\r\n\r\n\r\n36   EXT.

He had seen many\r\n                   terrible things....\r\n                                        (beat)\r\n                   He was not a man to frighten\r\n                   easily.\r\n                                 (MORE)\r\n                                                          (CONTINUED)\r\n                        GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   35.\r\n38A   CONTINUED:                                                  38A\r\n                                 MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)\r\n                   But from that day on, when the sun\r\n                   went down behind the hills...in\r\n                   his eyes, I saw the fear a child\r\n                   has of the dark.\r\n                                        (beat)\r\n                   Then, one day, a man came to the\r\n                   door.\r\n\r\n\r\n39    FLASHBACK - INT/EXT. SABATIN HOUSE - DAY                     39\r\n\r\n      We are over the shoulder of someone who could be Raizo or\r\n      Takeshi as the door opens revealing Alexei.\r\n\r\n      After a moment Alexi invites the man in. A security\r\n      camera watches them enter the house.\r\n\r\n                                 MRS. SABATIN (V.O.)\r\n                   They talked in Alexei's study for\r\n                   sometime. Then the young man\r\n                   left.\r\n\r\n      Mrs. Sabatin watches the young man leave then hurries\r\n      toward the study door.\r\n\r\n                                 MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)\r\n                   It was unlike Alexei not to see\r\n                   him out. I remember being very\r\n                   scared. But when I opened the\r\n                   door, he was just sitting there.\r\n                   For a moment, he didn't even\r\n                   notice me. Then he stood up and\r\n                   kissed me and told me that he\r\n                   loved me very much. He said I\r\n                   should always remember that.\r\n\r\n      We see Alexei looking shell-shocked, eyes hollowed, as he\r\n      stands and kisses his wife. His eyes begin to shimmer\r\n      with tears but before he cries, he leaves.\r\n\r\n39A   BACK TO SCENE                                               39A\r\n\r\n                                 MIKA\r\n                   Do you know what they talked\r\n                   about?\r\n\r\n                                 MRS.

SABATIN HOUSE - NIGHT                      40\r\n\r\n      The lights have come on outside his house. Alexei comes\r\n      out, a gun in hand, shielding his eyes. Searching for\r\n      whatever set off the automatic lights.\r\n\r\n      Then, suddenly: darkness.\r\n\r\n      And sudden MOVEMENT in the shadows that LUNGES toward\r\n      Alexei.\r\n\r\n40A   As Mrs. Sabatin shakes her head, looks away.    Shrugs.    40A\r\n\r\n                              MRS. SABATIN\r\n                The lights went out.\r\n\r\n      She looks to Mika.   That says it all.   She rises.\r\n\r\n                              MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)\r\n                You are the first person who has\r\n                taken my husband's work seriously.\r\n                It would be good to know that he\r\n                did not die without cause. Come\r\n                with me.\r\n\r\n      Mika follows her into --\r\n\r\n      -- an adjoining room, where Mrs. Sabatin pulls the bottom\r\n      drawer of a bureau out and sets it on the floor. From\r\n      the darkness she removes a metal box.\r\n\r\n                              MRS. SABATIN (CONT'D)\r\n                He would want you to have this.\r\n\r\n\r\n41    INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY                       41\r\n\r\n      Raizo sits alone. Crossed-legged on the floor. Utterly\r\n      still.\r\n\r\n      There's an ocean of sound swirling around him.    The\r\n      cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour.\r\n\r\n      Raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one\r\n      by one, walling off the outside world.\r\n\r\n      The traffic outside- horns, engines, squealing tires,\r\n      rattling trucks chassis- all fade away.\r\n\r\n      People shouting, singing. A couple next door making love.\r\n      A baby wailing. Jackhammers pounding...\r\n\r\n      Slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one\r\n      sound. Faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear...\r\n\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                     GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08     37.\r\n41   CONTINUED:                                                 41\r\n\r\n     Raizo's heartbeat.\r\n\r\n     He listens to it.    Meditates on its simple rhythm...\r\n\r\n     Until a sound explodes in the room, it is a sound we\r\n     haven't heard in his apartment-\r\n\r\n     A phone.\r\n\r\n     He rises slowly as the phone continues to ring.   He\r\n     answers it silently waiting for something-\r\n\r\n     The line clicks and goes dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n42   EXT. ISTANBUL STREET SOUK - DAY                            42\r\n\r\n     Raizo walks through the crowded market. Shoppers,\r\n     salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the\r\n     stalls.\r\n\r\n     FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past.\r\n     Shouting laughing. The last one jostles against Raizo as\r\n     he goes by.\r\n\r\n     Raizo keeps walking, but he is holding an envelope in his\r\n     hand. He slips it into his pocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n43   EXT. ISTANBUL STREET - DAY                                 43\r\n\r\n     Raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street.\r\n     There's a square of paper inside, and a photograph.\r\n\r\n     On the paper is a street address in Berlin. The\r\n     photograph is a close-up of a woman's face...\r\n\r\n     Mika.\r\n\r\n\r\n44   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  44\r\n\r\n     Close on the box. It sits on her desk, calling as\r\n     another box once called to Pandora.\r\n\r\n     She opens it.\r\n\r\n     Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the\r\n     style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea\r\n     scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta.\r\n\r\n     The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and\r\n     several sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\r\n                       GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   38.\r\n44   CONTINUED:                                                 44\r\n\r\n     There is also a very rough map that suggests the location\r\n     of The Orphanage.\r\n\r\n     Images of the orphanage, of the children training and\r\n     their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings\r\n     on the Nightingale floor.\r\n\r\n     There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage\r\n     tree of the Nine Clans.\r\n\r\n     Also in the box is a single VHS tape.\r\n\r\n     She pushes the tape into the player.\r\n\r\n     It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the\r\n     front of the Sabatin house.\r\n\r\n     A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We\r\n     cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They\r\n     exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man\r\n     in.\r\n\r\n     Mika doesn't understand why this is significant.\r\n\r\n     She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man\r\n     exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.                   *\r\n\r\n     As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his\r\n     face-\r\n\r\n     It is Raizo.\r\n\r\n     She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It\r\n     seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries\r\n     to open it revealing-\r\n\r\n     Maslow and he's not happy.\r\n\r\n                                MASLOW (O.S.)\r\n                  You lied to me.\r\n\r\n     He pushes into the room and slams the door behind him.\r\n\r\n                                   MIKA\r\n                  What're you --\r\n\r\n                                MASLOW\r\n                  I told you to stop using my\r\n                  confirmation code.\r\n\r\n                                   MIKA\r\n                  I did --\r\n\r\n                                MASLOW\r\n                  Dammit, Mika --                                    *\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                        GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT     6/4/08   39.\r\n44    CONTINUED: (2)                                               44\r\n\r\n                                 MIKA\r\n                   ...I'm sorry, it was the only way                    *\r\n                   I could get the evidence.                            *\r\n\r\n                                    MASLOW\r\n                   Shit....\r\n\r\n                                    MIKA\r\n                   What happened?\r\n\r\n                                 MASLOW\r\n                   What happened?

So I\r\n                  sit out here, at least it's cool.\r\n\r\n     Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to\r\n     believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. She\r\n     pulls a tiny LED flashlight out of her bag and starts\r\n     into the building.\r\n                                                         (CONTINUED)\r\n                       GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   47.\r\n52   CONTINUED:                                                 52\r\n\r\n                                NEIGHBOR (CONT'D)\r\n                  Watch your step.\r\n\r\n                                MIKA\r\n                  You're not the first person to\r\n                  give me that advice today....\r\n\r\n     And she continues into --\r\n\r\n\r\n53   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT           53\r\n\r\n     -- where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the\r\n     possibility of attracting trouble. On the passing\r\n     floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps,\r\n     the distant murmur of voices. Could be nothing. Could\r\n     be everything. She presses on.\r\n\r\n\r\n54   INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      54\r\n\r\n     She opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny\r\n     light ahead of her. Shadows chase each other across the\r\n     room as she swings the light one way, then another.\r\n     There seems to be no one else in the place. But as she\r\n     hurries into her home office, we see --\r\n\r\n     A shadow move behind her.\r\n\r\n     As she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping.\r\n     The same sound she heard before. She pulls the gun from\r\n     her purse. With the flashlight spearing the darkness,\r\n     she goes to her office.\r\n\r\n     Again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing\r\n     against the sash.\r\n\r\n     She is certain the window had been locked.\r\n\r\n     Now every shadow is alive.\r\n\r\n     She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction.\r\n     Her flashlight finds her suitcase. On the top of her\r\n     clothes she sees it: An envelope. Perfectly centered.\r\n\r\n     Setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami-folded\r\n     envelope. Opens it with a shaking finger.\r\n\r\n     Black sand spills out.\r\n\r\n     Terror steals her breath. Behind her, a shadow tilts and\r\n     reveals the eyes of a ninja.\r\n\r\n     Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the\r\n     darkness, heading for her neck-\r\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\r\n                         GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT    6/4/08   48.\r\n54   CONTINUED:                                                    54\r\n\r\n     Another shadow blocks the blade, knocking Mika over the\r\n     bed.\r\n\r\n     The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the\r\n     combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding\r\n     darkness.\r\n\r\n     Her flashlight catches glimpses. Impossibly fast, lethal\r\n     predators trying to kill each other.\r\n\r\n     She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase,\r\n     towards the gun. Another blow arcs for her and is again\r\n     blocked.\r\n\r\n     Her hand finds the handle of the gun.         She points into\r\n     the dark, fires.\r\n\r\n     The gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas\r\n     in the blink of a flashbulb.\r\n\r\n     They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying.\r\n\r\n     She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she\r\n     finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep-\r\n\r\n     Blood erupts.       One shadow falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n     The other turns towards her. Her flashlight shakes as\r\n     the ninja reaches up and removes his mask.\r\n\r\n     It is Raizo.\r\n\r\n     He sees in her eyes that she knows him.\r\n\r\n                                  RAIZO\r\n                  You know me?\r\n\r\n     She nods.\r\n\r\n                                  RAIZO (CONT'D)\r\n                  How?\r\n\r\n                                MIKA\r\n                  ...security camera in New York.                        *\r\n                  Recorded you fighting...one of                         *\r\n                  them.                                                  *\r\n\r\n     She glances at the dead ninja.                                      *\r\n\r\n                                RAIZO                                    *\r\n                  You know about them?                                   *\r\n\r\n                                  MIKA\r\n                  A little.                                              *\r\n\r\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\r\n                      GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   48A.\r\n54   CONTINUED: (2)                                             54\r\n\r\n     He waits.                                                       *\r\n\r\n                               MIKA (CONT'D)                         *\r\n                 Uhh-- Well, there are these                         *\r\n                 clans...we're not sure how many.                    *\r\n\r\n                                 RAIZO                               *\r\n                 Nine.                                               *\r\n\r\n                               MIKA                                  *\r\n                 Okay.

Watching silently.\r\n\r\n      He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except\r\n      that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length\r\n      of his face.

There's no place for the ninjas to\r\n      hide anymore.

An attack misses wrapping a beam\r\n      and Ozunu has his opening-\r\n\r\n      His assault is ferocious.\r\n\r\n      Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood\r\n      billowing out.\r\n\r\n      Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or\r\n      deflecting the whirlwind attack until--\r\n\r\n      One sound cuts through the furious fight.\r\n\r\n      Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as--\r\n\r\n      The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place.\r\n\r\n                                   MIKA\r\n                   Die you fuck!\r\n\r\n      She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet\r\n      grazes him.\r\n\r\n                                   OZUNU\r\n                   Bitch!\r\n\r\n      A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor.\r\n      But the distraction gives Raizo his chance.\r\n\r\n      The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of\r\n      Ozunu.\r\n\r\n      Rage thunders the hall.\r\n\r\n      Mika gets back up and aims but--\r\n\r\n      Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as\r\n      he disappears.\r\n\r\n                                   MIKA\r\n                   Raizo\r\n\r\n                                                           (CONTINUED)\r\n                        GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08   92.\r\n119   CONTINUED:                                                119\r\n\r\n      She cannot see him.\r\n\r\n      Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst,\r\n      his blade shatters through Raizo's chain--\r\n\r\n      Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his\r\n      chest.\r\n\r\n      Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces.\r\n\r\n                                  RAIZO\r\n                   Mika!

His\r\n      eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull.\r\n\r\n      She spins around but is too late.\r\n\r\n      The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as-\r\n      -\r\n\r\n      Raizo finds them.\r\n\r\n      He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls--\r\n\r\n      His pain a force of nature unleashed.\r\n\r\n      The chain blades crackle in the air-\r\n\r\n      Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which-\r\n\r\n      Finally shatters against Raizo's fury.\r\n\r\n      And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the\r\n      whistling blades lazering through his body until he\r\n      separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched\r\n      rag doll.\r\n\r\n      Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--\r\n\r\n      --hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks\r\n      through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the\r\n      door.\r\n\r\n\r\n120   EXT.
