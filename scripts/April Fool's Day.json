There is asense of anticipation,\r\n          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO\r\n          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,\r\n          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and\r\n          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -\r\n          - sets the scene.\r\n                         \r\n                         SWEET COED\r\n                         (SHYLY)\r\n          Hi...

Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm\r\n          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place\r\n          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including\r\n          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in\r\n          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.\r\n                         \r\n                         MUFFY\r\n          (puffing with the effort)\r\n          No, Clara, thanks.

See you Monday.\r\n                         \r\n          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind\r\n          Clara.\r\n          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining\r\n          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a\r\n          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible\r\n          departing the grounds.\r\n                         \r\n          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the\r\n          sounds.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,\r\n          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --\r\n          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly\r\n          dripping faucet.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

He shoulders his lightweight\r\n          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end\r\n          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are\r\n          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE - PARKING LOT\r\n                         \r\n          It's not Rob, though.

She\r\n          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town\r\n          girl, overdressed for the occasion.\r\n                         \r\n                         NAN\r\n                         (HURRIED)\r\n          Hi... is this the ferry to the St. John house?\r\n                         \r\n                         NIKKI I\r\n          Any second now.\r\n                         \r\n                         NAN\r\n          Oh, thank goodness !

Hanging on the wall in front of them is\r\n          a large oil portrait with the eyes out out.

Behind it is an\r\n          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to\r\n          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-\r\n          cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,\r\n          like a pendulum marking seconds.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Kit sits down slowly on\r\n          the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on\r\n          his side.\r\n                         \r\n          They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in\r\n          the middle of the bed.\r\n                         \r\n                         KIT\r\n          Rob?\r\n                         \r\n          No answer.\r\n                         \r\n                         KIT\r\n          You still angry with me?

I'm just angry.\r\n                         \r\n          He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the\r\n          bathroom comes on. Beat.\r\n                         \r\n          He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in\r\n          and turns off the light...\r\n          ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly\r\n          covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead\r\n          light...\r\n                         \r\n          ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still\r\n          tries to stifle it.\r\n                         \r\n          Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He\r\n          reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it\r\n          and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.\r\n                         \r\n                         ROB\r\n          (burning his fingers)\r\n          Ouch! Jesus!\r\n                         \r\n          Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob\r\n          perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into\r\n          darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          Silence.\r\n                         \r\n                         ROB\r\n          Very funny.\r\n                         \r\n          Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is\r\n          laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

BACK PORCH - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Uncle Frank is hugging Muffy. (nothing seedy). They are alone out\r\n          here.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          I'll make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can\r\n          draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for Wednesday's\r\n          signing. I'm so proud of you.\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I wish I could say the same about your brother.\r\n                         \r\n                         MUFFY\r\n          Oh, Uncle Frank, he's been a great help this weekend, really. Let me\r\n          get him out here so you can--\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          I've already spoken with him.\r\n                         \r\n          The screen door opens, and Rob steps out onto the porch. He comes over\r\n          to them, but does not butt into their conversation, and Uncle Frank\r\n          just keeps going as if Rob weren't even there.\r\n                         \r\n          UNCLE FRANK (cont.)\r\n          His conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable. He knows\r\n          your father can't be expected to entrust him with anything until he\r\n          shows some signs of responsibility and initiative.\r\n                         \r\n                         ROB\r\n          (embarrassed to be overhearing)\r\n          Excuse me.\r\n          He turns and walks back into the house.\r\n                         \r\n          O.S. a horn honking.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          The van and the old pickup are idling out front. Uncle Frank is\r\n          honking on the van horn.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          Come on! Let's go!\r\n                         \r\n          Cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup.\r\n                         \r\n          Skip walks casually up to the van, then pointedly turns away and heads\r\n          over to the pickup instead. Uncle Frank scowls.\r\n                         \r\n          ANGLE - FRONT DOOR\r\n                         \r\n          Rob and Kit come out the door and stop beside Muffy.\r\n                         \r\n          More honking.\r\n                         \r\n                         KIT\r\n          Well, I hate to say it -- I still ought to kill you -- but thanks.\r\n                         (THEY HUG)\r\n          See you back there.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          Come on. If time is money, we're losing a fortune.\r\n                         \r\n          Nikki now runs out followed closely by Harvey. They say their quick\r\n          farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles.\r\n                         \r\n          Harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup, while Nikki climbs\r\n          aboard the van, passing Chaz who just glares at her. He knows. Finally\r\n          Nan comes out of the house. With a curt nod to Muffy, she heads on\r\n          toward the van when...\r\n                         \r\n                         MUFFY\r\n          Nan!\r\n                         \r\n          She hurries to catch up with her.\r\n                         \r\n                         MUFFY\r\n          Let me say again how sorry I am. It wasn't intended.\r\n                         NAN\r\n          And now all is forgiven. I played along, didn't I? What's done is\r\n          done.\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I've learned a lot, Muffy, I really have. I suppose I should say thank\r\n          you, but I don't think I would be able to without it sounding false.\r\n          So I'll just say goodbye.\r\n          (beat; an afterthought)\r\n          Thanks for showing me your house.\r\n                         \r\n          She turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard. The others callout\r\n          their last goodbyes. Muffy waves, and then they are gone and Muffy\r\n          turns and walks forlornly back into her house.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. FERRY LANDING - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Cal and Uncle Frank are the first ones onto the ferry.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          Cal, I want to thank you personally.

I know you haven't been\r\n          spending your money on anything else all these years... But... this\r\n          time it just isn't in the cards.\r\n                         \r\n                         CAL\r\n          It's still in the family.\r\n                         \r\n                         UNCLE FRANK\r\n          Yes, that's the way.\r\n                         \r\n          He moves on. Others are passing them now. Chaz stops and wags his\r\n          finger at Cal.\r\n                         \r\n                         CHAZ\r\n          This time, no funny business.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Muffy stand, overlooking the mess. Not knowing exactly where to\r\n          begin, she starts emptying ashtrays into each other, then just stops.\r\n                         \r\n          She walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly\r\n          climbs the stairs.\r\n          EXT.

FERRY - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          closer now we can see what's happening on board... Rob and Skip lean\r\n          against the rail and talk quietly. Kit and Arch and Buck sit together\r\n          and chat... Chaz sits alone, and Nikki sits apart from him, also\r\n          alone.\r\n                         \r\n          Nan is up front, gazing out over the bow, while Harvey stands beside\r\n          her trying to make conversation. Finally, he gives up and strolls to\r\n          the back of the craft, pointedly passing Nikki.\r\n                         \r\n          He alights next to Uncle Frank, who has his briefcase open on his lap.\r\n                         \r\n          Now Nikki stands and goes and sits down next to Chaz.\r\n                         \r\n                         CHAZ\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          Feeling better?\r\n                         \r\n                         NIKKI\r\n                         (QUIETLY)\r\n          I'm okay now, thanks.\r\n                         \r\n          Pause.\r\n                         \r\n                         NIKKI\r\n          Chaz, I'm sorry.\r\n                         \r\n                         CHAZ\r\n          Why?
