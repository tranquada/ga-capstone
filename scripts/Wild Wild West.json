ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT                                    A1\n\n     A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop.\n     The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound.\n\n     SUPERIMPOSE:   1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA\n\n     But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER --\n     BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but\n     a --\n\n     SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the\n     horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME!\n\n     The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away,\n     chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange\n     metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die.\n\n\n     NEW ANGLE - MORTON\n\n     He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running\n     forever.\n\n                              MORTON\n                       (mumbling)\n                Madman... Hideous spider... Run...\n                Run! Warn the President...\n\n     Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate\n     attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the\n     ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the\n     trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies.\n\n\n     NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON\n\n     dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field.\n     Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES\n     straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit\n     everywhere! There's no stopping this thing.\n\n\n     NEW ANGLE - MORTON\n\n     running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns,\n     incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life,\n     cowering.\n\n                                 MORTON\n                Noooooooo!!!!!\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n     WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                                2.\n\nA1   CONTINUED:                                                       A1\n\n     And the DISC SWOOSHES TOWARD the CAMERA -- BZZZZZZZ!\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n\n     BLACK\n\n                                                     DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\n     NIGHT SKY FULL OF STARS - LOW ANGLE\n\n     A man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH.      And\n     he's there to collect the silver death disc.\n\n                                McGRATH\n                         (to the unseen,\n                          dead Morton)\n                  And they says you scientists are\n                  supposed to be smart.\n\n\n1    EXT.

Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels.\n     Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs.\n     As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse\n     team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for...\n\n\n2    EXT.

WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         3\n\n     WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL.\n\n                                WEST\n                  That's right, sugar, and you\n                  should feel free to treat him\n                  just bad.\n\n     She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears\n     the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the\n     kiss and peeks out the knothole.\n\n\n4    EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT\n\n     Down below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs.\n\n    WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            3.\n\n5   INT.

I thought\n              y'all was never gonna show up.\n\n                            SALOON GIRL\n              Mister West, you wouldn't be here\n              workin' tonight, now would you?\n\n                             WEST\n              No, no.

He surreptitiously peeks out\n    the knothole, while continuing his kiss.\n\n\n6   INT. FAT-CAN CANDY'S - NIGHT                                  6\n\n    This two-story, Victorian building across town is a\n    \"gentlemen's sporting house\" in name only. Drunken\n    roughnecks and ex-Confederate soldiers goose and maul\n    the rouged-up tarts.\n\n    AT BAR - WOMAN\n\n    shrinks back from the moronic ribaldry. The Toulouse\n    Lautrec lighting only accentuates her garish hair and\n    makeup, identifying her as a SOILED DOVE. A whore -- not\n    to put too fine a point on it. She's trying not to make\n    eye contact with two men seated at a table across the\n    parlor.\n\n\n    SOILED DOVE'S POV - GEN. McGRATH AND HUDSON\n\n    HUDSON is a fearsome-looking Indian in a well-tailored\n    suit. Long black braids descend incongruously from under\n    a homburg hat. As for his companion...\n\n    McGRATH is a mountain of drunken pus. Six foot, sweating\n    like a Devonshire hog with his tattered, undersized\n    Confederate dress jacket buttoned all the way to the top.\n    His ear has been hacked off and replaced by what looks to\n    be a miniature leather Victrola horn. McGrath smiles at\n    our Soiled Dove and makes a little kissing gesture.\n\n                                                    (CONTINUED)\n\n    WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            4.\n\n6   CONTINUED:                                                   6\n\n    ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE\n\n    Eyes widened in revulsion. What evil abides in this\n    Godforsaken place? Now a drunkenly EYE-CROSSED REB\n    licks Dora's ear, then whispers something in it.\n    Something unspeakably vile, by Dora's expression.\n\n                              DORA\n                 I'm sorry. That won't be\n                 possible. I have... tonsillitis.\n\n\n7   EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT         7\n\n    The Rebs load the boxes onto the wagon. We see the wheel\n    of the wagon up against the rotted leg of the water\n    tower.\n\n                               BIG REB\n                 Pack'er up good, Virgil.

WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                     8\n\n    West is unaware that she's watching him, not watching\n    her.\n\n                               SALOON GIRL\n                        (admonishing)\n                 Jim!\n\n                               WEST\n                 Ah, this hole is a safety issue.\n                 I'm thinking, what if it starts to\n                 rain and the water level goes up.\n                 It could suck you right up. I'm\n                 protecting you. (variations)\n\n    Saloon Girl frustrated, has grabbed West's boxer shorts\n    (with little horses on them) and plugs the hole with\n    them.\n\n                               SALOON GIRL\n                 Problem solved.\n\n                               WEST\n                 Belle, you don't just ram a man's\n                 underbritches into a knothole.\n                 You wanna plug the hole, you ram\n                 your own britches in there.\n\n    West is at a loss.    She moves in for another kiss.\n\n     WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             4A.\n\n9    EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         9\n\n     The HORSES SPOOK as a crate is dropped onto the wagon.\n\n\n     CLOSE - AXLE\n\n     caught on the WATER TOWER LEG.    It CREAKS.\n\n\n10   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                       10\n\n     West hears the CREAK.    He breaks the kiss.\n\n                                SALOON GIRL\n               Oh, Jim.\n\n                             WEST\n                      (serious)\n               Much as I'd like to take credit\n               for that you might need to hand\n               me my gun...\n\n     The tower starts to topple.\n\n                             WEST\n               ... Hand me my gun.\n\n     It CRASHES...\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n\n11   EXT. WAREHOUSE SKYLIGHT - NIGHT                                11\n\n     West crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. The\n     only people more shocked than he is are the guards and\n     the Rebs he just dropped in on. West picks himself up,\n     smiles coolly at the drenched slack-jaws.\n\n                             WEST\n               Okay, who just made a wish?\n               Was it you?\n\n     He looks up at the freaked-out Saloon Girl, still in the\n     tank. She hangs on with one hand, the other hand\n     clutches his clothes.\n\n                             WEST\n               I could sure use those clothes\n               now.\n\n     She responds by Frisbee-ing his hat down. West picks it\n     up, with a look... uses it to cover his genitals.\n\n                                                     (CONTINUED)\n\n     WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                           4B.\n\n11   CONTINUED:                                                   11\n\n                                BIG REB\n                  Well, we got us a shy nig...\n\n     But he never gets that word out. Bang!

And you boys lost,\n                  remember?\n\n     As the other Reb comes at him, he spins, still holding\n     the hat in front of him... and whap! Down that one goes.\n     West looks up at the none-too-bright water tank woman.\n\n                                WEST\n                  How 'bout some pants!?\n\n     As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap...\n\n                                                              5.\n\n12   INT.

His eyes drift\n     upwards... to the balcony where...\n\n\n     ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS\n\n     have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk.\n\n                             McGRATH\n               I'm still waiting on my guns and\n               ammo, but I see my men have\n               brought your merchandise.\n\n     McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for\n     Hudson to confirm.

Her\n     corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    The\n     Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground.\n\n     Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS\n     GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us\n     shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb\n     behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig...\n\n\n15   INT.

I've gotta train to\n                  catch.\n\n     West swings into the saddle.

He sighs, climbs on the\n     bike, takes out a hankie and cleans a pair of goggles.\n     Then, finally ready...\n\n                                 GORDON\n                  Avant!!!\n\n     VROOOM!

Fiery\n     exhaust blasts out of the manifolds as the bike propels\n     him down the street at about 60 mph right past...\n\n\n     ANGLE ON WEST AND HIS STALLION\n\n     who both look over in wide-eyed shock. The horse rears\n     as Gordon SCREAMS by -- leaving them in a cloud of\n     internal combustion.\n\n\n39   EXT. C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY            39\n\n     From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the\n     spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired\n     Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman\n     pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST\n     us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger\n     cars.\n\n     Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to\n     catch up.\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                               25.\n\n39   CONTINUED:                                                      39\n\n     ANGLE - WITH WEST\n\n     riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of\n     his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the\n     rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see\n     Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to\n     be sewing.\n\n                                WEST\n                  Stop this train!! You hear me!?!\n\n     If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    He just\n     casually makes the next stitch.\n\n     West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the\n     train. At the last second, West leans over at full\n     gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He\n     swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life,\n     blowing in the breeze like laundry.\n\n     Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its\n     weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh!\n     He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding\n     partition in the roof.\n\n\n40   INT.

Bar\n     stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative\n     pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a\n     club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling\n     into a seat.

As his\n     eyes sweep the room...\n\n\n     ANGLE - WEST\n\n     He ducks behind a mountain man carrying the French\n     tricolor. When Loveless and General McGrath disappear\n     into the study and close the door, West eases after\n     them. He pauses as he passes the \"Soiled Dove,\" leans\n     into her big bouffant.

The one behind\n     the desk is in the style of Gainsborough. A Loveless\n     uncle is standing on a windswept grouse moor, two English\n     setters by his side, a Holland and Holland double held in\n     the crook of his arm.\n\n     West turns his attention to the desk blotter. There's a\n     faint imprint where Loveless drew the map. West takes\n     his penknife and a pencil -- grates some graphite into\n     the depressions. He's just about to do a rubbing on a\n     piece of paper when... someone swipes it out of his hand.\n\n\n     ANGLE ON MISS EAST\n\n     Hands on hips, she gives him a \"naughty, naughty\" look.\n\n                                MISS EAST\n                  I said to meet me in the foyer.\n\n                                WEST\n                  Oh, the foy-aay.

Gordon\n     squints at her, gives a charming smile.\n\n                                GORDON\n                  I feel as if we know each other\n                  from someplace...?\n\n                                RITA\n                  Try again, buster...!\n\n     She takes a breath as if she's going to start screaming.\n     Gordon quickly holds up a hand.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n     THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                         46.\n\n66   CONTINUED:                                                      66\n\n                                GORDON\n                  Ma'am, please! While I realize I\n                  look like something straight out\n                  of James Fenimore Cooper... I mean\n                  you no harm. My name is Artemus\n                  Gordon. And you look like you're\n                  in trouble.\n\n                                      RITA\n                            (dryly)\n                  Really?\n\n     To Rita's amazement, Gordon opens his jacket and\n     unbuttons his vest to reveal... a complete miniature tool\n     shop. Quickly he pulls out a thin cable and attaches it\n     to a tiny wheel on the spur of one of his boots.\n\n                                 RITA\n                  I'm Rita. I was hired here as an\n                  entertainer. Not that I'm\n                  complaining, but what are you\n                  doin' in here?\n\n                                GORDON\n                         (looking up miles\n                          of leg)\n                  Looking for some missing\n                  scientists... not that I'm\n                  complaining.\n\n     Gordon unsnaps the sole of his shoe. It becomes a pedal\n     that operates the wheels' rotation. Now he removes a bit\n     and handle from his vest and attaches the cable. Starts\n     to pump his foot. It's a foot-powered drill.\n\n                                GORDON\n                  I'm a special U.S. Marshal on\n                  assignment from the President.\n\n                                RITA\n                         (almost impressed)\n                  If you're so special, how come\n                  you're lookin' up here when\n                  Loveless has 'em all workin' down\n                  in the dungeon?\n                         (rattles bars\n                          impatiently)\n                  Get me out of here and I'll take\n                  you down there.\n\n                                                       (CONTINUED)\n\n     WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            47.\n\n66   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             66\n\n                                GORDON\n                  Too late. The 'dungeon' is\n                  cleaned out. It was the first\n                  place I checked, right after I\n                  sampled the gumbo. Bit heavy on\n                  the okra.\n\n     But Rita isn't listening to the food review. Her mind's\n     racing. Finally, the LOCK CLICKS and the cage door\n     swings open. Gordon takes the distressed damsel in his\n     arms, lifts her out.\n\n                                 RITA\n                         (suddenly a coquettish\n                          smile)\n                  Thank you...

First, the whole\n                  drumming on the boobies thing.\n                  In my native land, Africa, my\n                  ancestors used drums to\n                  communicate between villages. I'm\n                  sure y'all can see that this young\n                  girl here can communicate all the\n                  way down to Baton Rouge. Hell, on\n                  a clear day, we might even get\n                  Galveston.

You know, some of my\n                  best friends are whiskey-guzzling,\n                  pot-bellied rednecks just like\n                  y'all here.\n                         (then)\n                  That slavery thing, I don't see\n                  what the big deal was.

He opens\n     his pocket watch.\n\n                                REB #1\n                  They oughta be here by now.\n\n                                REB #2\n                  Maybe we're in the wrong place.\n\n                                REB #1\n                         (rechecks map)\n                  No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly\n                  on this here spot.\n\n     Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from\n     the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive\n     positions. What they can't see through the fog is...\n\n\n     ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK\n\n     amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds,\n     passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the\n     center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon\n     and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs\n     cheer their new weapon.\n\n     THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         52.\n\n71   EXT.

As soldiers shield their eyes from the\n     blinding light...\n\n\n     ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD\n\n     Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained\n     the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart\n     board appearance.\n\n     Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over\n     their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their\n     Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's\n     impenetrable skin like goober peas.\n\n\n72   EXT.

He and West tug-o'-war again.\n      West ducks under the shovel and moves back-to-front with\n      him. West elbows him in the ribs. He responds by putting\n      West in a choke hold.
