CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER\r\n</b>          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of\r\n          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of\r\n          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of\r\n          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.\r\n\r\n<b>                          LIDEWIJ\r\n</b>           Shall we?\r\n          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So\r\n          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.\r\n\r\n<b>                          LIDEWIJ\r\n</b>           This is the bookcase that hid the\r\n           Frank family and four others.\r\n          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set\r\n          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.\r\n\r\n<b>           80.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks\r\n          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the\r\n          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen\r\n          tank.\r\n          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored\r\n          breathing the entire time.\r\n          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.\r\n          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.\r\n          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's\r\n          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall\r\n          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           You're a champion.\r\n          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the\r\n          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more\r\n          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this\r\n          he looks at Hazel:\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           That's enough --\r\n\r\n<b>                          HAZEL\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                          (RESOLUTE)\r\n</b>           I'm ok.\r\n          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her\r\n          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.\r\n          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull\r\n          herself through.\r\n          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the\r\n          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           We're at the top. That's it.\r\n          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.\r\n          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.\r\n          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.\r\n          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding\r\n          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing\r\n          their story.\r\n\r\n<b>                          LIDEWIJ\r\n</b>           The only member of the whole family\r\n           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.\r\n          Gus takes Hazel's hand.\r\n\r\n<b>                          LIDEWIJ\r\n</b>           I don't know how you go on, without\r\n           your family.\r\n\r\n<b>           81.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads\r\n          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO\r\n          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear\r\n          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.\r\n          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the\r\n          same. The room is dark.\r\n\r\n<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n</b>           \"At such moment's, I don't think\r\n           about the misery...\"\r\n          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the\r\n          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.\r\n\r\n<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n</b>           \"...but about the beauty that still\r\n           remains.\"\r\n          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she\r\n          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.\r\n          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...\r\n\r\n<b>           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n</b>           \"Try to recapture the happiness\r\n           within yourself. Think of all the\r\n           beauty in everything around you...\r\n           and be happy.\"\r\n          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-\r\n          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've\r\n          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a\r\n          small eternity.\r\n          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly\r\n          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,\r\n          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...\r\n          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the\r\n          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts \"bravo!\" Hazel blushes,\r\n          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand.

Hazel is very in the\r\n          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           It's above my knee.\r\n          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           It tapers a little and then it's\r\n           just skin --\r\n\r\n<b>                          HAZEL\r\n</b>           What?\r\n\r\n<b>           82.\r\n</b>\r\n                         \r\n          Hazel pulls away from him.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           My leg.\r\n\r\n<b>                          (BEAT)\r\n</b>           Just so you're prepared --\r\n\r\n<b>                          HAZEL\r\n</b>           Oh get over yourself.\r\n          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off\r\n          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure\r\n          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They\r\n          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical\r\n          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:\r\n\r\n<b>                          HAZEL\r\n</b>           I love you, Augustus Waters.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS\r\n</b>           I love you too, Hazel Grace.\r\n          They resume kissing.

On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.\r\n          It reads: \"Dearest Augustus...\"\r\n          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled \"Virgins.\" And in that\r\n          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled \"17 year old dudes\r\n          with one leg.\" We'll notice part of that circle is now\r\n          outside the bigger circle.

Her eyes were closed,\r\n           her lungs were intubated...\r\n\r\n          Gus takes her hand and holds it.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n</b>           ... but her hands were still her\r\n           hands, still warm, and the nails\r\n           painted this dark blue back color\r\n           and I just held her hands and I\r\n           willed myself to imagine a world\r\n           without us and what a worthless\r\n           world that would be.\r\n          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that\r\n          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER\r\n</b>          Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen\r\n          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and\r\n          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n</b>           She's so beautiful. You don't get\r\n           tired of looking at her. You never\r\n           worry if she's smarter than you\r\n           cause you know she is. She's funny\r\n           without ever being mean.\r\n\r\n<b>                         SHE REMEMBERS:\r\n</b>          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.\r\n          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.\r\n          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.\r\n          - Falling onto the bed together.\r\n\r\n          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the\r\n          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we\r\n          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make\r\n          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as\r\n          beautiful - because they're real.]\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n</b>           I love her, god I love her. I'm so\r\n           lucky to love her, Van Houten.\r\n\r\n<b>                          (MORE)\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           114.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>           GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           You don't get to choose if you get\r\n           hurt in this world but you do have\r\n           a say in who hurts you.\r\n\r\n          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her\r\n          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.\r\n\r\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n</b>           I like my choices.

Another.\r\n          Hazel OPENS HER EYES.
