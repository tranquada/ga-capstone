It's much shorter than the \"Perfect\" version, the\r\n          result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few\r\n          years before.\r\n\r\n           HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           ... my mother decided I was\r\n           depressed.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I'm not depressed.\r\n\r\n          Hazel's legs dangle over the side of an exam table.

She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of\r\n          delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his\r\n          shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat\r\n          - goes back to the book.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           Which is what was happening to me.\r\n\r\n          And we CUT BACK TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - SAME\r\n\r\n          Frannie continues to talk to the doctor.

SIMMONS (late 60s, white beard, old school) speaks next.\r\n\r\n           DR. SIMMONS\r\n           It's a strange case. Normally the\r\n           tumors start resisting the\r\n           treatment. But that hasn't happened\r\n           here - yet.\r\n          Hazel hears the \"yet\" the loudest.\r\n\r\n           DR.

MARIA\r\n           That's what we have to decide. The\r\n           truth is... very few people have\r\n           been on Phalanxifor as long as\r\n           Hazel has. We don't really know the\r\n           long term effects.\r\n          That comforts no one.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Can't I just get like a lung\r\n           transplant or something?\r\n          The Doctors look at one another like \"who wants to take that\r\n          one?\" Eventually:\r\n\r\n           DR. MARIA\r\n           You would not be considered a...\r\n           strong candidate for a transplant.\r\n          Hazel takes that in, nods, tries to pretend it didn't bother\r\n          her. Sensitive Michael on the other hand starts to cry a\r\n          little bit. He grabs Frannie's hand.\r\n\r\n           DR.

As soon as her tank reappears she puts the cannula\r\n          back in place. Still light-headed, Hazel closes her eyes and\r\n          focuses on her breathing.

Through the closed\r\n          door, they hear this:\r\n\r\n           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)\r\n\r\n                          (SHOUTING)\r\n\r\n           LEEE-DUH-VIGH!\r\n\r\n           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Are they here, Peter?\r\n          So it is PETER VAN HOUTEN.

Perhaps this will\r\n          help things take a turn for the better.\r\n\r\n           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)\r\n           The Americans?\r\n\r\n           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           You invited them, remember?\r\n\r\n           MAN IN PAJAMAS (O.S.)\r\n           You know why I left America,\r\n           Lidewij? To never have to encounter\r\n           Americans. Get rid of them.\r\n          Hazel and Gus can't believe it. This is terrible!\r\n\r\n           WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           I will not do this Peter. Be nice.\r\n          At which point, the door opens - opened by the Woman whose\r\n          voice they'd been hearing - Van Houten's assistant LIDEWIJ\r\n          (30s, Dutch, pretty in a bookish way). She virtually shoves\r\n          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.\r\n          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,\r\n          two beats. No one knows what to say. Finally:\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Which of you is Augustus Waters?\r\n          Gus raises his hand tentatively.\r\n          Van Houten sizes them up. Without another word, he turns and\r\n          walks inside - at least this time, leaving the door ajar.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           Please. I am sorry. Come in.\r\n          Hazel and Gus share one more awkward glance before Gus takes\r\n          a step. Hazel follows. They walk:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT VAN HOUTEN'S HOME - SAME\r\n          Lidewij leads Gus and Hazel into a living room so sterile\r\n          it's creepy. The walls are empty and white, there's a single\r\n          couch, a small ottoman, and a single lounge chair. That's it.\r\n          Van Houten sits in the chair.\r\n          Off to the side are two large black garbage bags, full and\r\n          twist-tied.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Trash?\r\n\r\n           72.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           Fan mail. 18 years worth. He never\r\n           opens it.\r\n          Van Houten kicks his feet up on the ottoman and crosses his\r\n          slippers.

He takes a sip, then sits up straight.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           So you like my book.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Yes.

As\r\n          they get to the street, Van Houten has one more thing to say.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Have you ever stopped to ask why\r\n           you care so much about your silly\r\n           questions?\r\n          A beat.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Go fuck yourself.\r\n          Van Houten doesn't have a response to that. He just shuts the\r\n          door. And when he does, that's when Hazel gets emotional.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           Hey. It's ok. It's ok...\r\n           (beat, an idea)\r\n           I'll write you a sequel.\r\n           (she cries harder)\r\n           I will. Better than any shit that\r\n           drunk could write. With blood and\r\n           guts and sacrifice. You'll love it.\r\n          Hazel nods, then wipes away tears. She fakes a smile and Gus\r\n          gives her a hug. Afterwards:\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I spent your Wish on that asshole.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           You did not spend it on him.

I know. Apparently the\r\n           world is not a wish-granting\r\n           factory.\r\n          This gets a real smile from Hazel. That's when Lidewij comes\r\n          outside. Clearly she's been crying too.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           I'm so sorry. Circumstance has made\r\n           him cruel.

Steep\r\n           stairs.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I can do it.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I can do it!\r\n          Hazel is not going to stand for any more disappointments\r\n          today. They are going inside. CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT ANNE FRANK HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER\r\n          A VIDEO plays on a MONITOR showing the Nazi invasion of\r\n          Holland. Hazel and Gus stand with Lidewij in a pack of\r\n          BACKPACKERS and TRAVELERS about to take the tour. Many of\r\n          them begin to walk up the first flight of stairs.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           Shall we?\r\n          Hazel nods. Both Hazel and Gus walk slowly up the stairs. So\r\n          far so good. They find themselves in an office space.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           This is the bookcase that hid the\r\n           Frank family and four others.\r\n          The BOOKCASE is half open. Behind it is an even steeper set\r\n          of stairs, only wide enough for one person at a time.\r\n\r\n           80.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Some of the Travelers begin to walk up the stairs. Gus looks\r\n          at Hazel - are you sure we should continue? She begins the\r\n          climb, determined. Lidewij trails behind, carrying her oxygen\r\n          tank.\r\n          Hazel moves very slowly. We are aware of her labored\r\n          breathing the entire time.\r\n          ANGLE ON OTHER TOURISTS, watching and quietly commenting.\r\n          Just like at the airport, except now in foreign languages.\r\n          Hazel arrives on the NEXT FLOOR - an empty room. She's\r\n          definitely starting to struggle. She leans against the wall\r\n          to catch her breath. Gus comes to her side, wipes her brow.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           You're a champion.\r\n          Hazel smiles. When she's feeling up to it they walk into the\r\n          next room, also empty. And another staircase, even more\r\n          narrow and steep - practically a ladder. When Gus sees this\r\n          he looks at Hazel:\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           That's enough --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n\r\n                          (RESOLUTE)\r\n           I'm ok.\r\n          Hazel very slowly begins the climb. Again we're aware of her\r\n          every breath. It's dark. And it's becoming very difficult.\r\n          Near the top Hazel stumbles but is finally able to pull\r\n          herself through.\r\n          Once there, she falls to the floor, slumping against the\r\n          wall, trying to catch her breath. Gus crouches next to her.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           We're at the top. That's it.\r\n          Hazel becomes aware that TOURISTS look at her with concern.\r\n          She smiles, stands up, nothing to see here.\r\n          And now they're in the final room - a long, narrow hallway.\r\n          This is where Anne Frank and 7 other people lived in hiding\r\n          for as long as they could. There's a TIME LINE detailing\r\n          their story.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           The only member of the whole family\r\n           to survive was Otto, Anne's father.\r\n          Gus takes Hazel's hand.\r\n\r\n                          LIDEWIJ\r\n           I don't know how you go on, without\r\n           your family.\r\n\r\n           81.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Lidewij stays behind to study part of the exhibit. Gus leads\r\n          Hazel into the room at the end of the hallway where a VIDEO\r\n          details the last days of Anne Frank's life. Over it, we hear\r\n          a YOUNG GIRL's VOICE reading from the diary.\r\n          The Travelers stand to watch and listen. Gus and Hazel do the\r\n          same. The room is dark.\r\n\r\n           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           \"At such moment's, I don't think\r\n           about the misery...\"\r\n          Gus and Hazel stand very closely together. The video is the\r\n          cherry on top of a very emotional day. Hazel watches it.\r\n\r\n           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           \"...but about the beauty that still\r\n           remains.\"\r\n          Gus, meanwhile, is just watching Hazel, the same way she\r\n          watched him on the airplane. After a beat, she catches him.\r\n          Their eyes meet. The emotions build...\r\n\r\n           GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           \"Try to recapture the happiness\r\n           within yourself. Think of all the\r\n           beauty in everything around you...\r\n           and be happy.\"\r\n          And Hazel KISSES Gus. A most passionate, intense, you-and-me-\r\n          against-the-world kind of kiss, better than any they've\r\n          experienced or could even imagine. It seems to last for a\r\n          small eternity.\r\n          Eventually, they break away and open their eyes. They quickly\r\n          notice all the Travelers staring at them. For a brief second,\r\n          they wonder if that was a very inappropriate thing to do...\r\n          When suddenly everyone starts clapping for them, moved by the\r\n          whole thing. One EUROPEAN even shouts \"bravo!\" Hazel blushes,\r\n          Gus smiles, bows, he grabs her hand. CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT GUS'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER\r\n          They fall onto Gus's bed, kissing. Hazel is very in the\r\n          moment and now it's Gus who seems nervous. As they kiss:\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           It's above my knee.\r\n          She ignores him, more kissing. She takes off his shirt.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           It tapers a little and then it's\r\n           just skin --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           What?\r\n\r\n           82.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Hazel pulls away from him.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           My leg.\r\n\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Just so you're prepared --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Oh get over yourself.\r\n          Hazel kisses him again. Now he tries to pull her shirt off\r\n          but it gets tangled in with her oxygen tube. He can't figure\r\n          it out. Eventually the whole thing is hilarious to them. They\r\n          shake their heads - laughing - certainly not your typical\r\n          Hollywood movie moment. And yet, for them:\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I love you, Augustus Waters.\r\n\r\n                          GUS\r\n           I love you too, Hazel Grace.\r\n          They resume kissing. And we CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING\r\n          Gus wakes up in the bed. He looks around for Hazel but she\r\n          isn't there. On the bed is a piece of paper. A note.\r\n          It reads: \"Dearest Augustus...\"\r\n          Beneath that is a BIG CIRCLE, labeled \"Virgins.\" And in that\r\n          circle is a SMALLER SECOND CIRCLE labeled \"17 year old dudes\r\n          with one leg.\" We'll notice part of that circle is now\r\n          outside the bigger circle.

I'd been\r\n           asked this question hundreds of\r\n           times and I remember once, early\r\n           on, when I couldn't catch my breath\r\n           and it felt like my chest was on\r\n           fire, and the nurse asked me to\r\n           rate the pain and though I couldn't\r\n           speak, I held up 9 fingers.\r\n          The loud music isn't protecting Hazel as well as she hoped.\r\n          She falls apart nonetheless.\r\n\r\n           HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           Later on, when I'd been feeling\r\n           better, the nurse came in and she\r\n           called me a fighter. \"You know how\r\n           I know,\" she said. \"Because you\r\n           called a ten a nine.\"\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT HAZEL'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER MORNING\r\n          Hazel puts on her funeral dress. She looks in the mirror.\r\n\r\n           HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           But that wasn't the truth. The\r\n           reason I called it a nine was... I\r\n           was saving my ten.\r\n\r\n           105.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT CHURCH - DAY\r\n          The place is filled today with mourners for Augustus Waters.\r\n          Hazel comes in with her parents and stands in the back,\r\n          watching people she's never seen before approach the Waters\r\n          family and extend their deepest condolences.\r\n\r\n           HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           And this was it. The great and\r\n           terrible ten.\r\n          When Mr. and Mrs. Waters see Hazel, they open their arms.\r\n\r\n           MRS. WATERS\r\n           He loved you so much.\r\n          Hazel nods. Hugs them back.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           He loved you so much too.\r\n          More MOURNERS approach the family, leaving Hazel stranded in\r\n          the receiving line. Her eyes turn towards the COFFIN. She's\r\n          not entirely sure she wants to go there but she takes a deep\r\n          breath, wills herself to walk towards it.\r\n          Gus is there in the same suit he wore to Oranjee.\r\n          Immediately, Hazel breaks down. And immediately, she catches\r\n          herself.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           It's ok, you hear me? It's ok.\r\n          She leans forward and kisses his cheek. She looks around.\r\n          Once in the clear, she pulls out a hard pack of Camel Lights\r\n          and sticks them in the space between Gus and the lining of\r\n          the coffin. A MINISTER approaches at that moment.\r\n\r\n                          MINISTER\r\n           I think we're ready to begin.\r\n          Hazel nods and walks back to her parents, taking her seat in\r\n          the middle of the room.\r\n\r\n                          MINISTER\r\n           Augustus Waters fought hard for\r\n           many years. His battle was a\r\n           courageous one and his strength was\r\n           a source of inspiration for each\r\n           and every one of us...\r\n          Hazel frowns. This is all such bullshit. And she hears:\r\n\r\n                          MALE VOICE\r\n           What a load of shit, eh kid?\r\n          Hazel recognizes that voice. But it doesn't make sense. She\r\n          turns around and, sure enough, it's Peter Van Houten.\r\n\r\n           106.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          MINISTER\r\n           Let us pray.\r\n          Everyone clasps their hands, closes their eyes. Hazel keeps\r\n          staring at Van Houten, too shocked to do a thing.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           We need to fake pray now.\r\n          Van Houten bows his head. Hazel, still stunned, slowly turns\r\n          back to the Minister, trying to make sense of this unexpected\r\n          appearance.\r\n\r\n                          MINISTER\r\n           Now I call on Augustus's close\r\n           friend Isaac to say a few words.\r\n          Isaac stands, walks up to the podium with someone's help.\r\n          Hazel sneaks one more look at Van Houten. Yup, it's really\r\n          him. That makes no sense to her. Isaac starts to speak.\r\n\r\n                          ISAAC\r\n           Of all the things I've lost in my\r\n           life, this hurts the most.\r\n          And Isaac stops talking. It's unclear if that was the end or\r\n          if he just can't go on. He returns to his seat. The Minister\r\n          walks back up.\r\n\r\n                          MINISTER\r\n           And now we'll hear from Gus's...\r\n           special friend Hazel Lancaster.\r\n          Hazel stands, walks up to the podium. A few titters in the\r\n          room at the words \"special friend.\"\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I was his girlfriend.\r\n          Some laughter from the crowd. She takes out her notes.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           There's a beautiful quote in Gus's\r\n           home that reads \"if you want the\r\n           rainbow, you gotta deal with the\r\n           rain.\"\r\n          Hazel continues to speak but we over it, WE HEAR instead:\r\n\r\n           HAZEL (V.O.)\r\n           I didn't believe a word, of course.\r\n           But that was ok. Funerals, I'd\r\n           decided, aren't for the dead.\r\n           They're for the living.\r\n          Gus's Parents, arm in arm, nod along with every word. CUT TO:\r\n\r\n           107.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT CEMETARY - DAY\r\n          Everyone is watching Gus's body be lowered into the ground.\r\n          Everyone but Hazel. She looks off into the distance.\r\n          Off to the side, we see Van Houten, also not watching the\r\n          burial. He's watching Hazel. CUT TO:\r\n          LATER. Ceremony over, we see Hazel with her parents.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I'll be fine.\r\n\r\n                          FRANNIE\r\n           Are you sure? We can drive you --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           No, I'd... I'd like to be alone for\r\n           a while.\r\n          Hazel hugs Mom and Dad, walks alone towards the parking lot.\r\n          As she gets to the car, Van Houten approaches.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Could I hitch a ride?\r\n          Hazel doesn't want to help this man.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Just to the bottom of the hill.\r\n          Hazel exhales. Fine. Once they're both in the car:\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           How did you even --\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           The internet.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           And you just... bought a ticket?\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           The drinks are free drinks in First\r\n           Class.\r\n          Van Houten removes a FLASK from his coat pocket. Takes a\r\n          swig. Hazel shakes her head in disgust. Starts driving.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Omnis Cellula e cellula.\r\n          Hazel ignores him.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Your boy Waters and I corresponded\r\n           quite a bit in his last --\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           You read your fan mail now?\r\n\r\n           108.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           I would hardly call him a fan. He\r\n           despised me. But he was quite\r\n           insistent I attend his funeral and\r\n           tell you what became of Anna and\r\n           her mother. So here I am and that's\r\n           your answer: omnis cellula e\r\n           cellula.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           I'm so not in the mood --\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           \"Life comes from life.\"\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Goodbye Mr. Van Houten.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           You don't want an explanation?\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Nope.

She\r\n           suffered... beautifully. For so\r\n           long.\r\n          Hazel starts to understand Van Houten - and softens.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           She had leukemia? Like Anna?\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Just like her, yes.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Were you married then?\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Not when she died, no. I was\r\n           insufferable long before Anna, my\r\n           dear. Grief doesn't change you,\r\n           Hazel, it reveals you.\r\n          Hazel takes that in.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Well I'm sorry for your loss.\r\n\r\n           109.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           And I'm sorry for yours.

We had an awesome trip.\r\n\r\n                          VAN HOUTEN\r\n           Hazel, I'm trying. I'm trying! You\r\n           asked me to tell you what happens\r\n           and I wish I could do that. I wish\r\n           that I could. But I can't. No one\r\n           can. No one knows, Hazel. They\r\n           don't talk to us. Unless...\r\n          Van Houten takes out a typed piece of paper. He hands it to\r\n          Hazel who grabs it - and immediately crumples it into a ball.\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           You think I care about that?

He does as he's told,\r\n          stepping out of the car onto the side of the road. He stands\r\n          there as Hazel peels out.\r\n          In the rearview mirror, she sees him raise the FLASK, as if\r\n          toasting her. She blinks away some tears and drives.

Isaac stays behind,\r\n          enjoying the cool night. A new day is coming.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT/ EXT HAZEL'S CAR - DAY\r\n          Hazel is inside the car, rummaging crazily through the trash\r\n          in an effort to find what Van Houten gave her. She's about to\r\n          give up when she sees it - crumpled up into a ball beneath\r\n          the passenger's seat. She reaches under, pulls it up, and\r\n          unwraps it. As she reads, WE HEAR:\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           Mr. Van Houten, I'm a good person\r\n           but a shitty writer. You're a\r\n           shitty person but a good writer.\r\n           We'd make a good team. I don't want\r\n           to ask you any favors but if you\r\n           have the time, and from what I saw\r\n           you have plenty, please fix this\r\n           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.\r\n          Hazel is overcome with emotion.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           She asked me to write one and I'm\r\n           trying, I just, I could use a\r\n           little flair. See the thing is...\r\n           we all want to be remembered.\r\n          She smiles to herself, remembering:\r\n          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.\r\n          - The staring contest in Support Group.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           We all want to leave a mark.\r\n          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.\r\n          - Their first kiss at the picnic by \"Funky Bones.\"\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           But not Hazel. Hazel is different.\r\n           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't\r\n           want a million admirers, she just\r\n           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe\r\n           she wasn't loved widely but she was\r\n           loved deeply. And isn't that more\r\n           than most of us get?\r\n          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           When Hazel was sick, I knew I was\r\n           dying. But I didn't want to say so.\r\n\r\n           113.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          INT ICU - FLASHBACK\r\n          Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.\r\n          She sleeps. He kneels by her side.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           She was in ICU and I snuck in for\r\n           ten minutes and sat with her before\r\n           I got caught. Her eyes were closed,\r\n           her lungs were intubated...\r\n\r\n          Gus takes her hand and holds it.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           ... but her hands were still her\r\n           hands, still warm, and the nails\r\n           painted this dark blue back color\r\n           and I just held her hands and I\r\n           willed myself to imagine a world\r\n           without us and what a worthless\r\n           world that would be.\r\n          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that\r\n          story, never knew he was there. CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          EXT HAZEL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER\r\n          Hazel walks out to the grass behind her house, the oxygen\r\n          tank dragging behind her. She lays down on the grass and\r\n          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           She's so beautiful. You don't get\r\n           tired of looking at her. You never\r\n           worry if she's smarter than you\r\n           cause you know she is. She's funny\r\n           without ever being mean.\r\n\r\n                         SHE REMEMBERS:\r\n          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.\r\n          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.\r\n          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.\r\n          - Falling onto the bed together.\r\n\r\n          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the\r\n          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we\r\n          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make\r\n          these images less beautiful. They make them twice as\r\n          beautiful - because they're real.]\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           I love her, god I love her. I'm so\r\n           lucky to love her, Van Houten.\r\n\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n\r\n           114.\r\n\r\n           GUS'S VOICE (CONT'D)\r\n           You don't get to choose if you get\r\n           hurt in this world but you do have\r\n           a say in who hurts you.\r\n\r\n          - AND BACK ON Hazel in the grass. She holds the letter to her\r\n          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           I like my choices. I hope she likes\r\n           hers.\r\n\r\n          Hazel CLOSES HER EYES.\r\n\r\n                          GUS'S VOICE\r\n           Ok, Hazel Grace?\r\n\r\n          A beat. Another.\r\n          Hazel OPENS HER EYES. And she says to the universe:\r\n\r\n                          HAZEL\r\n           Ok.\r\n\r\n           BLACK.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nFault in Our Stars, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Scott Neustadter\u00a0\u00a0Michael H.
