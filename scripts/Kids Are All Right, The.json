But her moms won't let\r\n      go. They keep holding her and crying.\r\n\r\n      Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.\r\n\r\n      Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,\r\n      unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.\r\n\r\n      The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.\r\n\r\n      Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,\r\n      resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.\r\n\r\n      Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.   They hold her\r\n      tight to comfort her.\r\n      They keep holding her until a calm sets in.\r\n\r\n      The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.\r\n      Joni gives her moms one last smile.\r\n      Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands\r\n      watching as they drive off and her new life begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>      INT.

Nic's in the\r\n      passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.\r\n\r\n      No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.

She gives it a gentle squeeze and\r\ndoesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.\r\n\r\nNic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and\r\nJules look at each other, and then away.\r\n\r\nLaser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.\r\nTheir small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,\r\ngrateful for a sign.\r\n\r\n<b>FADE OUT\r\n</b><b>THE END\r\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Kids-Are-All-Right,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Kids Are All Right, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Lisa Cholodenko\" title=\"Scripts by Lisa Cholodenko\">Lisa Cholodenko</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Stuart Blumberg\" title=\"Scripts by Stuart Blumberg\">Stuart Blumberg</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Kids Are All Right, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Kids Are All Right, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:09:04.068624"}
