It just seems a little\r\n          cart before the horse.\r\n                    JULES\r\n          What does that mean?\r\n                    NIC\r\n          Sweetie, you don't even have any\r\n          clients yet.\r\n                    JULES\r\n          Well you're the one who's always\r\n          telling me to \"act as if!\"\r\n\r\n                    NIC\r\n              (back peddling)\r\n          That's true. I do. You're right.\r\n\r\nThe women settle back.   Nic sees Jules feels bad.\r\n                    NIC (CONT'D)\r\n          Look, I'm sorry. It's good you\r\n          bought the truck. Its proactive.\r\n\r\nNic caresses Jules' arm, wanting to make it better.\r\n                      NIC (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey...\r\n\r\nJules doesn't look at Nic.   She keeps her eyes on the T.V.\r\n                    NIC (CONT'D)\r\n          Wanna watch a movie?\r\n\r\nJules perks up.    Nic immediately regrets her suggestion.\r\n                    JULES\r\n          A movie-movie?\r\n\r\n                   NIC\r\n          Yeah. We haven't done that in a\r\n          while.\r\n\r\nMINUTES LATER -- NIC AND JULES\r\nare cozied up side-by-side facing the TV.\r\n                                                                9.\r\n\r\n     ANGLE ON - THE TV\r\n\r\n     The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise\r\n     longue. One guy fellating the other.\r\n\r\n     INT. STAIRCASE - SAME\r\n13                                                                13\r\n\r\n     Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the\r\n     mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a\r\n     drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.\r\n     She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the\r\n     words: \"Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life.\"\r\n\r\n     INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER\r\n14                                                                14\r\n\r\n     ANGLE ON - THE BED\r\n\r\n     We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,\r\n     and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into\r\n     it, but having a hard time.\r\n\r\n                         NIC\r\n               I don't like the guys in this one.\r\n               They're too shaved.\r\n\r\n                         JULES\r\n               Don't focus on it.\r\n                         NIC\r\n               How about the one with the biker\r\n               gang?\r\n\r\n                         JULES\r\n               We left it in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n     Jules wrestles with the blankets.    Wants them out of her way.\r\n\r\n                         NIC\r\n                   (pulling them back up)\r\n               I'm cold, honey.\r\n\r\n                            JULES\r\n               Sorry.     I couldn't breathe.\r\n     Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.\r\n     The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top\r\n     sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME\r\n     CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full\r\n     volume.\r\n                                                               10.\r\n\r\n                         MAN IN MOVIE\r\n               Suck that fat cock mother-fucker...\r\n\r\n                            NIC\r\n               Shit!!     Where's the remote?!\r\n\r\n                         MAN IN MOVIE\r\n               I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...\r\n     Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the\r\n     mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting\r\n     and 70's disco music blares.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INT.

She hears the porno music\r\n     pulsing though.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INT.

She flips though\r\n     some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4\r\n     YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a\r\n     camera with a big, open grin.\r\n\r\n                                                    MATCH CUT TO:\r\n                                                             11.\r\n\r\n     EXT.

This is PAUL, Joni\r\n     and Laser's biological father.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INT.

He approaches\r\n     TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.\r\n                         PAUL\r\n               How you doing, foxy?\r\n\r\n                         TANYA\r\n               Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n               Oh, sorry...\r\n                         TANYA\r\n               No, I like it.

To the point where he lets slip...\r\n                         JAI\r\n               It's like she has to sexualize\r\n               every experience, you know? It's\r\n               just sad...\r\n     That stops Joni in her tracks.\r\n\r\n                         JONI\r\n               Yeah, it is. It's really sad.\r\n     Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n     INT.

First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.\r\n                          LASER\r\n                It's gonna be weird not having you\r\n                at home.\r\n\r\n                          JONI\r\n                Sorry to leave you alone with them.\r\n\r\n                             LASER\r\n                It's okay.     I can handle it.\r\n      Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,\r\n      tears streaming down their faces.\r\n                                                               97.\r\n\r\n                           JONI\r\n                Guys, come on...\r\n                    (beat)\r\n                Look, I'll talk to you soon.\r\n\r\n      Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let\r\n      go. They keep holding her and crying.\r\n\r\n      Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.\r\n\r\n      Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,\r\n      unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.\r\n\r\n      The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.\r\n\r\n      Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,\r\n      resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.\r\n\r\n      Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.   They hold her\r\n      tight to comfort her.\r\n      They keep holding her until a calm sets in.\r\n\r\n      The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.\r\n      Joni gives her moms one last smile.\r\n      Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands\r\n      watching as they drive off and her new life begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n      INT. STATION WAGON - DAY\r\n130                                                               130\r\n      The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the\r\n      passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.\r\n\r\n      No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.   Finally\r\n      Laser breaks the spell.\r\n\r\n                          LASER\r\n                I don't think you guys should break\r\n                up.\r\n      A long beat.\r\n\r\n                           NIC\r\n                No?   Why's that?\r\n                          LASER\r\n                I think you're too old.\r\n\r\n      Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is\r\n      unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.\r\n                                                            98.\r\n\r\n                     NIC\r\n           Thanks, Laser.\r\n\r\nJules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts\r\nher hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and\r\ndoesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.\r\n\r\nNic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and\r\nJules look at each other, and then away.\r\n\r\nLaser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.\r\nTheir small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,\r\ngrateful for a sign.\r\n\r\nFADE OUT\r\nTHE END\r\n\n\n\n\nKids Are All Right, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Lisa Cholodenko\u00a0\u00a0Stuart Blumberg\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:37.014945"}
