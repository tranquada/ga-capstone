Mildly depressed, he\nstretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio,\nfinds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he\nexamines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black\nhead and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of\ntobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the\nflame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out\nmatch as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary\ncowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks\napparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the\nroadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into\nthe next scene, Sally Buck sings softly \"... if that mocking\nbird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring...\"\n\n<b>INT. REMEMBERED BEAUTY SALON - ANOTHER TIME\n</b>\nSally Buck, relaxing in the middle of a busy day, eyes closed\nwearily, while little Joe massages her neck.

The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is\ndark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light\nstill burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead\nof Joe. Joe squirms, restless, trying to lull himself to\nsleep with the music of a revivalist gospel group on the\nradio.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSALLY BUCK'S VOICE \n</b>\tDon't forget to say your prayers,\n\thoney...\n\nJoe leans forward to help the old Lady, irritably struggling\nwith the release button on her seat. She scowls as Joe leans\nover to release her seat, then pulls her blanket around her\nand turns away from him. Joe switches off her reading light.\n\n<b>\t\t\tOLD LADY \n</b>\tI want it on.\n\nJoe switches it on again, fakes a good-natured grin, settles\nback with his radio, aware of an OLD COWHAND seated opposite\nhim, replacing the Pale Blonde. The Old Cowhand is appraising\nJoe's wardrobe curiously. He looks away when he sees Joe\nwatching him. Joe settles back, unable to think of a way to\nopen a conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\tEVANGELIST'S VOICE\n</b>\tOh, my friends, I say unto you,\n\tinvest with Jesus, put your dollars\n\tto work where they'll pay off at\n\tcompound interest.

Joe has started up before he\nnotices Ratso, leaning on the bannister at the foot of the\nstairs, struggling to catch his breath. His face and hair are\nwet with perspiration, his lips lavender-blue.\n\nIn swift flashes -- intercut -- Joe reads the panic in\nRatso's eyes, so intense that Joe shares it, unable to speak\nor offer reassurance.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE \n</b>\tBetter dry your hair some.

The MacAlbertsons\nmerely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with\ncameras strategically placed to record the happening...\n\n... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera \ndrifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a\ndetached, whimsical fashion.

Joe starts after him\nbut pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a\nlight show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies\nprojected against abstract currents of color and strobe\nlight...\n\n... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at\na low table, rolling joints for the guests.\nShe lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to\nwatch the show.

Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back\nto the crowded loft, fascinated to see...\n\n... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end\nof the loft, photographing the scene below...\n\n... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the\nstyle of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle,\npredatory eyes searching the crowd...\n\n... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the\nbuffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware\nof Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he\nsteals, turning away casually, disinterested...\n\n...

TRAVELING SHOT WITH BUS - DAY\n</b>\nPalm trees are streaking past the window. The sun is glaring\nhot. A group of kids in bare feet and straw hats wave to the\nbus as it passes.\n\n<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY\n</b>\nRatso's eyes squint in a dazed half-sleep. Joe leans across\nto pull down the shade. He hesitates a moment, watching...\n\n... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to\nwork, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now\ndressed...\n\n... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods\nslightly, his voice practically inaudible.\n\n<b>\t\t\tRATSO \n</b>\tThanks, Joe.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE \n</b>\tShee-it, you know, I got this thing\n\tall figured out, Ratso. I mean\n\tRico. When we get to Miami, what\n\tI'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta\n\tdo that, 'cause see, I ain't no\n\tkind of a hustler. I ain't even any\n\tgoddam good as a bum. I'm a\n\tnothing, that's what I am. So\n\treckon I'd better go to work and\n\tget me a goddam job. Okay?\n\nJoe glances at Ratso, but there is no response.\nSurreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face\naway from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand\nas he smokes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYeah, guess that's what I'm gonna\n\tdo.\n\nThey ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking\nat the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades\ndown. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing\nthat Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward\nposition. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking\nour view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning,\nthoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises\nslowly, starting forward in the bus...\n\n... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with\nstraw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he\nreaches...\n\n... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the\nDriver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\tYes, sir?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE,\n</b>\tMy friend's dead in the back seat.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\tYour friend's what in the back\n\tseat?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE\n</b>\tDead. Dead as a doornail.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\tIs this some kind of...\n\nHe glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tOkay, folks, everything's fine.\n\tNothing to worry about.\n\nThe passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to\nthe rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring\nahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches\nRatso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tIs he kin to you?\n\nJoe nods no.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tDon't you want to close his eyes?\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE\n</b>\tClose them?\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER \n</b>\tJust reach over and close them.\n\tThat's all.\n\nJoe closes Ratso's eyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER (CONT'D)\n</b>\tI guess we'll just drive on, right?\n\tNothing else to do.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJOE \n</b>\tNo, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see\n\tto burying then.\n\nThe Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.\n\n<b>\t\t\tDRIVER\n</b>\tJust a little sickness, folks,\n\tnothing serious. We'll be in\n\tMiami...\n\t\t(looks at watch)\n\t... in forty minutes.\n\n<b>INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY\n</b>\nJoe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then\nhe glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it\naround Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  THE END\n</b>\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Midnight Cowboy</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Leo Herlihy\" title=\"Scripts by James Leo Herlihy\">James Leo Herlihy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Waldo Salt\" title=\"Scripts by Waldo Salt\">Waldo Salt</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Midnight Cowboy Script.html#comments\" title=\"Midnight Cowboy comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:11:34.571215"}
