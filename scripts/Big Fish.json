It's not that they're faster \n                         or stronger than other fish. They're \n                         just touched by something extra. \n                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One \n                         such fish was The Beast.\n\n               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited \n               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past \n               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         By the time I was born, he was already \n                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-\n                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. \n                         Some said that fish was the ghost of \n                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned \n                         in that river 60 years before. Others \n                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, \n                         left over from the Cretaceous period.\n\n               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)\n\n               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD \n               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, \n               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with \n               absolute conviction.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I didn't put any stock into such \n                         speculation or superstition. All I \n                         knew was I'd been trying to catch \n                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger \n                         than you.\n                              (closer)\n                         And on the day you were born, that \n                         was the day I finally caught him.\n\n               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)\n\n               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES \n               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: \n                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut \n                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I \n                         had a revelation: if that fish was \n                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait \n                         wasn't going to work. I would have \n                         to use something he truly desired.\n\n               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.\n\n                                     LITTLE BRAVE\n                              (confused)\n                         Your finger?\n\n               Edward slips his ring off.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Gold.\n\n               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks \n               bored. He's heard this story before.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I tied my ring to the strongest line \n                         they made -- strong enough to hold \n                         up a bridge, they said, if just for \n                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.\n\n               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)\n\n               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming \n               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of \n               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.\n\n                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)\n                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it \n                         before the ring even hit the water. \n                         And just as fast, he snapped clean \n                         through that line.\n\n               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His \n               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and \n               practicality -- stands with him at the door.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You can see my predicament. My wedding \n                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my \n                         wife, soon to be the mother of my \n                         child, was now lost in the gut of an \n                         uncatchable fish.\n\n               ON WILL AND SANDRA\n\n                                     WILL\n                              (low but insistent)\n                         Make him stop.\n\n               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.\n\n                                     WILL'S DATE\n                         What did you do?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I followed that fish up-river and \n                         down-river for three days and three \n                         nights, until I finally had him boxed \n                         in.\n\n               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         With these two hands, I reached in \n                         and snatched that fish out of the \n                         river. I looked him straight in the \n                         eye. And I made a remarkable \n                         discovery.\n\n               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14\u00b0) - NIGHT (1998)\n\n               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This \n               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and \n               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.\n\n               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is \n               cozy and drunk.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time \n                         we were calling it a him, when in \n                         fact it was a her. It was fat with \n                         eggs, and was going to lay them any \n                         day.\n\n               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from \n               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier \n               if this were her own wedding.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now, I was in a situation. I could \n                         gut that fish and get my ring back, \n                         but doing so I would be killing the \n                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, \n                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.\n\n               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, \n               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-\n                         born son the chance to catch a fish \n                         like this of his own? This lady fish \n                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.\n\n               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --\n\n                                     EDWARD AND WILL\n                         We were part of the same equation.\n\n               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Honey, it's still your night.\n\n               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now, you may well ask, since this \n                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, \n                         why did it strike so quick on gold \n                         when nothing else would attract it?\n                              (closer; he holds up \n                              his ring)\n                         That was the lesson I learned that \n                         day, the day my son was born.\n\n               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has \n               always been -- about her more than anyone.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an \n                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a \n                         wedding ring.\n\n               A LAUGH from the crowd.\n\n               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she \n               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not \n               lessened their affection for each other.\n\n               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.\n\n               The crowd APPLAUDS.\n\n               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for \n               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.\n\n               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.\n\n               EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14\u00b0 - NIGHT\n\n               We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. \n               Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more \n               heated. Both men are a little drunk.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         What, a father's not allowed to talk \n                         about his son?\n\n                                     WILL\n                              (disbelieving)\n                         I am a footnote in that story.

BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]\n\n               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         The truth is, I didn't see anything \n                         of myself in my father, and I don't \n                         think he saw anything of himself in \n                         me. We were like strangers who knew \n                         each other very well.\n\n               EXT. RIVER - DAY\n\n               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         In telling the story of my father's \n                         life, it's impossible to separate \n                         the fact from the fiction, the man \n                         from the myth. The best I can do is \n                         to tell it the way he told me.\n\n               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught \n               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something \n               changes.\n\n               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, \n               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not \n               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world \n               had conspired to create him.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         It doesn't always make sense, and \n                         most of it never happened.\n\n               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, \n               grabbing hold of\n\n               THE BEAST.\n\n               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the \n               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         But that's what kind of story this \n                         is.\n\n               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back \n               into the water with a splash.\n\n               TITLE OVER:\n\n                                         BIG FISH\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's \n               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting \n               bedside manner...\n\n                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT\n                         Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to \n                         give me one good push. On three. \n                         One...\n\n               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets \n               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold \n               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up \n               into air.\n\n               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one \n               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we \n               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.\n\n               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides \n               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races \n               after it.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Bursting through the doors --\n\n                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT\n                         Grab that baby!\n\n               A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets \n               out a collective sigh of relief.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         My father's birth would set the pace \n                         for his unlikely life. No longer \n                         than most men's, but larger. And as \n                         strange as his stories got, the \n                         endings were always the most \n                         surprising of all.\n\n               INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY\n\n               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the \n               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has \n               that insistent European sound.\n\n               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly \n               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in \n               its carton.\n\n               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings \n               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of \n               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife \n               Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Allo oui?\n\n               Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer \n               unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a \n               reaction out of Josephine.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                              (on phone)\n                         Yes, he's here.\n\n               She hands the phone to Will, concerned.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         It's your mother.\n\n               Half-stripped, Will takes the phone.

Uh-huh.\n\n               As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, \n               very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the \n               conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.\n\n                                     WILL (CONT'D)\n                         What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, \n                         sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.\n\n               He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         It's bad.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         It's more than they thought.

AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT\n\n               As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the \n               welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. \n               Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.\n\n               Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an \n               effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's \n               feeling before he can.\n\n               INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT\n\n               Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS \n               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against \n               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.\n\n               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then \n               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.\n\n               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands \n               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, \n               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a \n               dog.\n\n               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.\n\n                                     EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)\n                         So which one's it gonna be?

BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               ...come to find Edward making the shapes.\n\n               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The \n               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big \n               shadows on the wall.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         The one about the witch.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Your mom says I can't tell you that \n                         one anymore.

He then leans in, complicitous.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Neither was I.

Witches use those \n                         bones to cast spells and curses that \n                         make the land infertile.\n\n               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically \n               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie \n               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to \n               fly over it.\n\n               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows \n               what is lurking in the shadows?\n\n                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, \n                         there was one who was the most feared. \n                         For she had one glass eye, which was \n                         said to contain mystical powers.\n\n               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.\n\n                                     WILBUR FREELY\n                         I hear if you look right at it, you \n                         can see how you're gonna die.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's \n                         not even a real witch.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         You're so sure, why don't you go in \n                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps \n                         it in a box on her nighttable.\n\n               Edward looks back at the spooky house.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         Or are you too scared?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'll go in right now and get that \n                         eye.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         Then do it.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Fine, I will.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         Fine, you do it.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Fine, I'm doing it.\n\n               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.\n\n                                     RUTHIE\n                         Edward, don't!\n\n                                     WILBUR FREELY\n                         She'll make soap out of you!\n                              (to Ruthie)\n                         That's what she does, she makes soap \n                         out of people.\n\n               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, \n               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.\n\n               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. \n               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don \n               holds him by the collar.\n\n               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE\n\n               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front \n               door. Anything could jump out of them.\n\n               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he \n               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. \n               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.\n\n               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look \n               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and \n               closer before he finally\n\n               RINGS THE DOORBELL.\n\n               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with \n               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead \n               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                              (calm and \n                              straightforward)\n                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and \n                         there's some folks'd like to see \n                         your eye.\n\n               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT\n\n               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more \n               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the \n               gate.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         You get the eye?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I brought it.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                              (dubious)\n                         Let's see it.\n\n               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping \n               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left \n               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.\n\n               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY\n\n               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing \n               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. \n               Dead.\n\n               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT\n\n               We RUSH IN on Don Price.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY\n\n               Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, \n               face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.\n\n               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT\n\n               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears \n               in his eyes.\n\n                                     ZACKY\n                         I saw how I was gonna die. I was \n                         old, and I fell.\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         I wasn't old at all.\n\n               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old \n               Woman, Edward smiles.\n\n               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT\n\n               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but \n               curiosity gets the better of him.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I was thinking about death and all. \n                         About seeing how you're gonna die.\n\n               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was \n                         all you thought about, it could kind \n                         of screw you up. But it could kind \n                         of help you, couldn't it? Because \n                         you'd know that everything else you \n                         can survive.\n\n               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.\n\n               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. \n               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks \n               into The Eye.\n\n               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he \n               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and \n               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. \n               His future has something strange in store.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Huh. That's how I go?\n\n               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns \n               and leaves.\n\n                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         From that moment on, I no longer \n                         feared death. And for that, I was as \n                         good as immortal.\n\n               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.\n\n                                                              MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY\n\n               The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the \n               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), \n               surprised and a little annoyed.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         How did you get here?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that \n                         big really.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up \n                         at the airport.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         We rented a car.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                              (simply)\n                         You didn't need to do that.

Starting over...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Hi, Mom.\n\n               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son \n               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- \n               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I'm so glad you're here.\n\n               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-\n               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         You shouldn't have flown.

The door \n                         sticks. You have to really pull it.\n\n               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. \n               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra \n               follows him.\n\n               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the \n               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for \n               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are \n               playing on the street.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Is that Dr. Bennett's car?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         He's up with your father.\n\n               Heading back to the house...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         How is he?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         He's impossible.

KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.\n\n               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded \n               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black \n               physician. He's still the town's best physician.\n\n                                     DR.

Josephine shakes her head.\n\n               Back to the main subject...\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         You don't think he looks any worse.\n\n                                     DR. BENNETT\n                         No. I would say he's the same.\n\n               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't \n               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Can I see him?\n\n                                     DR. BENNETT\n                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk \n                         to him.\n\n               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't \n               spoken in years.\n\n               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the \n               counter.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Get him to drink one of these. He \n                         won't, but tell him he has to.\n\n               INT. FOYER - DAY\n\n               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. \n               They CREAK with every step.\n\n               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most \n               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant \n               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can \n               see him growing up with every step.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the \n               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand \n               along the wallpaper.\n\n               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. \n               Then goes inside.\n\n               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY\n\n               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not \n               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. \n               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.\n\n               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.\n\n               Coming up to the bed --\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Dad?\n\n               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries \n               to say something, but no words come out.\n\n               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him \n               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.\n\n               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, \n               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.\n\n               Finally...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You --\n                              (he points)\n                         -- are in for a surprise.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Am I?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Having a kid changes everything. I \n                         mean, there's the diapers and the \n                         burping and the midnight feedings...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Did you do any of that?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then \n                         you spend years trying to corrupt \n                         and mislead this child, fill its \n                         head with nonsense and still it turns \n                         out perfectly fine.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         You think I'm up for it?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You learned from the best.\n\n               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers \n               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell \n                         her you drank the whole thing. \n                         Everyone wins.\n\n               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open \n               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         People needn't worry so much. It's \n                         not my time yet. This isn't how I \n                         go.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Really.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         The Old Lady by the swamp.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         She was a witch.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         No, she was old and probably senile. \n                         Maybe schizophrenic.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I saw my death in that eye. And this \n                         is not how it happens.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         So how does it happen?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to \n                         ruin it for you.\n\n               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, \n               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         There was this panhandler who used \n                         to stop me every morning when I came \n                         out of this coffee shop near the \n                         office.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         And every day I gave him a quarter. \n                         Every day. Then I got sick and was \n                         out for a couple of weeks. And when \n                         I went back there, you know what he \n                         said?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         What did he say?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You owe me three-fifty.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Really.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         True story.\n\n               A beat.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         When did you ever work in an office?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         There's a lot you don't know about \n                         me.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         You're right.\n\n               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't \n                         talk again. And look at us. We're \n                         talking fine. We're storytellers, \n                         both of us. I speak mine out, you \n                         write yours down. Same thing.\n\n               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about \n                         some things while I'm here.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You mean, while I'm here.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I'd just like to know the true \n                         versions of things. Events. Stories. \n                         You.\n\n               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING \n               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. \n               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from \n               talking.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Your mother hasn't been keeping up \n                         the pool. If you wanted to you \n                         could...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I will.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You know where the chemicals are?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I used to do it when you were gone, \n                         remember? I used to do it a lot.\n\n               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-\n               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I was never much for being at home, \n                         Will. It's too confining. And this, \n                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is \n                         the worst thing that ever happened \n                         to me.\n\n               He smiles at his joke.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I thought you weren't dying.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I said this isn't how I go. The last \n                         part is much more unusual. Trust me \n                         on that.\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of \n               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.\n\n               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he \n               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...\n\n               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]\n\n               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his \n               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's \n               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.\n\n                                     YOUNG WILL\n                         Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have \n                         to be home for a week.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         That's nothing. I once had to stay \n                         in bed for three years.\n\n                                     YOUNG WILL\n                         Did you have chicken pox?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I wish.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY\n\n               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about \n               10 -- sings \"Down to the River My Lord\" along with the \n               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it \n               his all.\n\n               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then \n               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, \n               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps \n               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.\n\n               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting \n               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to \n               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more \n               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.\n\n               ON HIS SHOES\n\n               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's \n               how fast he's growing.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was \n                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up \n                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.\n\n               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various \n               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen \n               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my \n                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up \n                         with my body's ambition. So I spent \n                         the better part of three years \n                         confined to my bed, with the World \n                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means \n                         of exploration. I had made it all \n                         the way to the \"G's,\" hoping to find \n                         an answer to my gigantificationism, \n                         when I uncovered an article about \n                         the common goldfish.\n\n               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.\n\n                                     YOUNG EDWARD\n                              (reading)\n                         \"Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish \n                         will remain small. With more space, \n                         the fish can grow double, triple, or \n                         quadruple its size.\"\n\n               Young Edward thinks this through.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps \n                         the reason for my growth was that I \n                         was intended for larger things. After \n                         all, a giant man can't have an \n                         ordinary-sized life.\n\n               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY\n\n               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The \n               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds \n               the bases.\n\n               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first \n               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from \n               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         As soon as my bones had settled in \n                         their adult configuration, I set \n                         upon my plan to make a bigger place \n                         for myself in Ashton.\n\n               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY\n\n               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. \n               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret \n               love:\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Edward Bloom!\n\n               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, \n               glowers.\n\n               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\n\n               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP \n               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of \n               his teenage EMPLOYEES.\n\n               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, \"Bloom \n               Landscaping.\" He has workers on every lawn.\n\n               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.\n\n               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY\n\n               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other \n               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.\n\n               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only \n               teammate who doesn't mob him.\n\n               EXT. TOWN - DAY\n\n               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.\n\n               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY\n\n               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine \n               labelled \"Perpetual Motion.\" He and the JUDGE pose for a \n               photograph. A FLASH.\n\n               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the \n               trash.\n\n               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY\n\n               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain \n               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don \n               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.\n\n               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.\n\n               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY\n\n               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had \n                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger \n                         arrived.\n\n               EXT. FARM - DAY\n\n               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a \n               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly \n               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.\n\n               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY\n\n               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They \n               BLEAT in panic as\n\n               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS\n\n               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're \n               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the \n               full stranger.\n\n               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY\n\n               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. \n               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.\n\n                                     SHARECROPPER\n                         He ate an entire cornfield!\n\n                                     LITTLE GIRL\n                         He ate my dog!\n\n                                     HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER\n                         If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, \n                         we will!\n\n                                     MAYOR\n                         I won't have mob violence in this \n                         town.

And then...\n\n                                     A VOICE (O.S.)\n                         I'll do it.\n\n               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal \n               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get \n                         him to move on.\n\n                                     MAYOR\n                         Son, that creature could crush you \n                         without trying.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Trust me, he'll have to try.\n\n               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY\n\n               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching \n               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the \n               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked \n               clean.\n\n               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Hello!\n\n               There's no answer.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to \n                         talk to you!\n\n               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:\n\n                                     VOICE (O.S.)\n                         GO AWAY!\n\n               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair \n               back.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'm not going anywhere until you \n                         show yourself.\n\n               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward \n               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's \n               going to take.\n\n               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even \n               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my \n                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't \n                         kill me. All the same, I preferred \n                         to keep my bones unbroken.\n\n               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.\n\n               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams \n               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.\n\n               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not \n               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard \n               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains \n               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living \n               in his matted hair.\n\n               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his \n               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice \n               it.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         Why are you here?\n\n               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         So you can eat me. The town decided \n                         to send a human sacrifice, and I \n                         volunteered.\n\n               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         My arms are a little stringy, but \n                         there's some good eating on my legs. \n                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them \n                         myself.\n                              (beat)\n                         So I guess, just, if you could get \n                         it over with quick. Because I'm not \n                         much for pain, really.\n\n               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. \n               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.\n\n               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see \n               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking \n               his chops --\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human \n                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone \n                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd \n                         rather be dinner than a coward.\n\n               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be \n                         an appetizer.\n\n               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But \n               the giant spits it back out.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         I don't want to eat you. I don't \n                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get \n                         so hungry. I'm too big.\n\n               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- \n               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.\n\n               Edward takes a seat beside him.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Did you ever think maybe you're not \n                         too big? Maybe this town's just too \n                         small. I mean, look at it.\n\n               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town \n               in a tiny valley.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. \n                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've \n                         got buildings so tall you can't even \n                         see the tops of 'em.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         Really?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got \n                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat \n                         a lot, can't you?\n\n                                     KARL\n                         I can.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         So why are you wasting your time in \n                         a small town? You're a big man. You \n                         should be in the big city.\n\n               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --\n\n                                     KARL\n                         You're just trying to get me to leave, \n                         aren't you? That's why they sent you \n                         here.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         What's your name, Giant?\n\n                                     KARL\n                         Karl.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do \n                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want \n                         to leave with you.\n                              (closer)\n                         You think this town is too small for \n                         you, well, it's too small for a man \n                         of my ambition. I can't see staying \n                         here a day longer.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         You don't like it?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I love every square inch of it. But \n                         I can feel the edges closing in on \n                         me. A man's life can only grow to a \n                         certain size in a place like this.\n                              (beat)\n                         So what do you say? Join me?\n\n               Karl thinks a moment. Then --\n\n                                     KARL\n                         Okay.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Okay.\n\n               They shake on it.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now first, we gotta get you ready \n                         for the city.\n\n               EXT. RIVER - DAY\n\n               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, \n               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY\n\n               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the \n               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and \n               Karl.\n\n               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.\n\n                                     MAYOR\n                              (loudly, for the crowd)\n                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, \n                         it's with a heavy heart we see you \n                         go. But take with you this Key to \n                         the City, and know that any time you \n                         want to come back, all our doors are \n                         open to you.\n\n               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his \n               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start \n               walking, waving as they go.\n\n               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward \n               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he \n               could crush Edward.\n\n               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or \n               shake his hand.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, \n                         everyone seemed to have advice.\n\n                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK\n                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't \n                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your \n                         pride, Edward Bloom!\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         But there was one person whose counsel \n                         I held above all others.\n\n               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with\n\n               THE OLD WOMAN.\n\n               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been \n               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper \n               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear \n               her voice.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         She said that the biggest fish in \n                         the river gets that way by never \n                         being caught.\n\n               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                              (to the Old Woman)\n                         Okay. Thanks.\n\n               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, \n               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         What did she say?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Beats me.\n\n               EXT. ROAD - DAY\n\n               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking \n               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly \n               possessions.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         There were two roads out of Ashton, \n                         a new one which was paved, and an \n                         older one that wasn't. People didn't \n                         use the old road anymore, and it had \n                         developed the reputation of being \n                         haunted.\n\n               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers \n               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road \n               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         Since I had no intention of ever \n                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as \n                         good a time as any to find out what \n                         lay down that old road.\n\n               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.\n\n                                     KARL\n                         You know anyone's who's taken it?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He \n                         was going to Paris, France. He must \n                         have liked it, because no one ever \n                         heard from him again.\n                              (beat)\n                         Tell you what. You take the other \n                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet \n                         you on the far side.\n\n               A little paranoid...\n\n                                     KARL\n                         You're not trying to run away?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Just to be sure, you can take my \n                         pack.\n\n               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.\n\n               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY\n\n               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is \n               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.\n\n               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's \n               a day meant for whistling.\n\n               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH\n\n               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight \n               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the \n               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.\n\n               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny \n               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, \n               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is \n               dead quiet.\n\n               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It \n               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.\n\n               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch \n               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.\n\n               FURTHER ALONG\n\n               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING \n               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at \n               them.\n\n               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right \n               out of his hands.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You stupid sonofa...\n\n               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The \n               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm \n               roars out.\n\n               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.\n\n               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]\n\n               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.\n\n               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. \n               Reads it:\n\n                                         WARNING!\n\n                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!\n\n               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with \n               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         There comes a point where a reasonable \n                         man will swallow his pride and admit \n                         he's made a terrible mistake. The \n                         truth is, I was never a reasonable \n                         man.\n\n               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         And what I recalled of Sunday School \n                         was that the more difficult something \n                         became, the more rewarding it was in \n                         the end.\n\n               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY\n\n               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs \n               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in \n               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he \n               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.\n\n               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty \n               and comforting.\n\n               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- \n               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling \n               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their \n               laces tied together.\n\n               He passes a sign that reads \"Welcome To Spectre!\"\n\n               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY\n\n               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, \n               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is \n               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group \n               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. \n               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.\n\n               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.\n\n                                     MAN'S VOICE\n                         Friend!\n\n               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store \n               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest \n               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Welcome to ya. What's your name?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Edward Bloom.\n\n               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips \n               forward a few pages. Still looking...\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Bloom like a flower?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. \n                         We weren't expecting you yet.\n\n               Still confused...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You were expecting me?\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Not yet.\n\n               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:\n\n                                     MILDRED\n                         You must have taken a shortcut.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I did. It nearly killed me.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And \n                         truthfully, the long way is easier, \n                         but it's longer.\n\n                                     MILDRED\n                         Much longer.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         And you're here now, and that's what \n                         matters.\n\n               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering \n               around to look at the handsome stranger.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         What is this place?\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret \n                         in Alabama. Says here you're from \n                         Ashton, right? Last person we had \n                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         The poet? What ever happened to him?\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         He's still here. Let me buy you a \n                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. \n                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm \n                         already running late.\n\n               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's \n               laughing.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Son, I already told you. You're early.\n\n               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of \n               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), \n               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never \n               left the state.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         Now tell me if that isn't the best \n                         pie you ever ate.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         It truly is.\n\n               UNDER THE TABLE\n\n               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         Everything here tastes better. Even \n                         the water is sweet. Never gets too \n                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night \n                         the wind goes through the trees and \n                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony \n                         out there, playing just for you.\n\n               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the \n               door.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Hey!\n\n               He chases after her.\n\n               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY\n\n               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching \n               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the \n               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever \n               getting them down.\n\n               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is \n               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his \n               hand.\n\n               Still focused on his shoes...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Wait!

UNDER A TREE - DUSK\n\n               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. \n               Thousands of them.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         A man might travel his entire life \n                         and never find a place so inviting. \n                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I \n                         had arrived.\n\n               Norther hands him his noteboook.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         I've been working on this poem for \n                         12 years.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Really.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         There's a lot of expectation.

You oughta be able \n                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, \n                         you could.\n\n               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.\n\n               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT\n\n               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the \n               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City \n               dangles around his neck.\n\n               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.\n\n               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.\n\n               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming \n               underwater. We never see her face.\n\n               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, \n               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his \n               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's \n               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he \n               frighten her away.\n\n               Then he sees the snake.\n\n               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, \n               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.\n\n               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward \n               dives in. He swims as hard as can,\n\n               GRABBING THE SNAKE\n\n               just as it's about to strike.\n\n               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified \n               that a man is coming at her.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the \n                         snake.\n\n               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in \n               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common \n               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.\n\n               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover \n               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her \n               face.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!\n\n               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she \n               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what \n               tricks his eyes are playing on him.\n\n               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS\n\n                                     A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         There's leeches in there!\n\n               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching \n               him.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Did you see that woman?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         What did she look like?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Well, she... uh...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Was she nekkid?\n\n               Embarrassed to admit it...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (matter-of-fact)\n                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No \n                         one ever catches her.\n\n               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow \n               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.\n\n                                     JENNY (CONT'D)\n                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent \n                         people.

He \n               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging \n               to his skin.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Shoot.\n\n               He starts to work pulling them off.\n\n               EXT.

MAIN STREET - NIGHT\n\n               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find \"downtown\" \n               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables \n               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one \n               end to hold FIDDLERS.\n\n               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, \n               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed \n               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.\n\n               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and \n               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants \n               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a \n               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.\n\n               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.\n\n               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.\n\n               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear \n               over the MUSIC.\n\n                                     MILDRED\n                         Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. \n                         We all do.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                              (not hearing)\n                         What?\n\n                                     MILDRED\n                         I said you're quite a catch!\n\n               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of \n               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I have to leave.

And if I were to end up \n                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But \n                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up \n                         anywhere.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                         No one's ever left.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         How are you gonna make it without \n                         your shoes?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.\n\n               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople \n               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.\n\n               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.\n\n                                     BEAMEN\n                              (calling after him)\n                         You won't find a better place!\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I don't expect to.\n\n               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Promise me you'll come back.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I promise. Someday. When I'm really \n                         supposed to.\n\n               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps \n               walking. \n\n               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. \n               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.\n\n               And then it gets worse.\n\n               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be \n               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood \n               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying \n               to block him.\n\n               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for \n               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab \n               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now \n               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes \n               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         As difficult as it was to reach \n                         Spectre, I was fated to get there \n                         eventually. After all, no man can \n                         avoid reaching the end of his life.\n\n               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the \n               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally \n               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.\n\n               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees \n               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush \n               him.\n\n               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         And then I realized, this wasn't the \n                         end of my life.\n\n               With a sudden calm...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                              (aloud)\n                         This isn't how I die.\n\n               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back \n               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn \n               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.\n\n               EXT.

DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra \n               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small \n               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's \n               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain \n               the family dinner ritual.\n\n               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a \n               knife or fork resonating.

AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT\n\n               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is \n               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.\n\n               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's\n\n               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she \n               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans \n               and sneakers.\n\n               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. \n               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. \n               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or \n               just find him attractive?\n\n               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.\n\n               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Before I forget, your father has \n                         papers in the basement I'd like you \n                         to go through.

Blonde \n                         hair.\n\n               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, \n               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, \n               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                              (no idea)\n                         Was she one of your teachers?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         No. But it's weird.

But \n                         finally I told my father. And he \n                         said not to worry, but I could tell \n                         he was rattled. That next day, he \n                         wasn't himself, always looking around, \n                         waiting for something to drop on his \n                         head. Because the crow didn't tell \n                         how it was going to happen, just \n                         those words: your Daddy is going to \n                         die. Well, he went into town early \n                         and was gone for a long time. And \n                         when he finally came back, he looked \n                         terrible, like he was waiting for \n                         the axe to fall all day. He said to \n                         my mother, \"Good God. I just had the \n                         worst day of my life.\"\n                              (beat)\n                         \"You think you've had a bad day,\" \n                         she said. \"This morning the milkman \n                         dropped dead on the porch!\" Josephine \n                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him \n                         smiling too.\n\n               A long beat. Then, deadpan...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Because see, my mother was banging \n                         the milkman.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         No, I understand.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         He was slipping her a little extra \n                         cream.\n\n               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         He was filling her basket. He was \n                         making deliveries around back.\n\n               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, \n               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         He was buttering her rolls. Pumping \n                         her churn. Splashing milk in her \n                         box.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Stop.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         They were squeezing the cheese. \n                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the \n                         popsicle.\n\n               She's starting to cry from laughing.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Cracking the eggs and making an \n                         omelet.\n\n               With that, he stops. She regains her composure.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Spooning the sherbet.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                              (interrupting)\n                         Can I take your picture?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You don't need a picture. Just look \n                         up handsome in the dictionary.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Please?\n\n               He rolls his eyes, why not.\n\n               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. \n               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)\n                         I have photos from the wedding to \n                         show you. There's a great one of you \n                         and my father. I had an extra print \n                         made.\n\n               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding \n               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.\n\n               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         I want to see pictures of your \n                         wedding. I've never seen any.\n\n               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job \n               masking the pain.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         That's because we didn't have a \n                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never \n                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged \n                         to somebody else.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                              (loading film)\n                         I never knew.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Will never told you that?\n                              (she shakes her head)\n                         Probably just as well. He would have \n                         told it all wrong anyway. All the \n                         facts and none of the flavor.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Oh, so this is a tall tale?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Well, it's not a short one.\n\n               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the \n               whirling fan.\n\n                                                              MATCH CUT TO:\n\n               SPINNING PINWHEEL\n\n               held by a LITTLE BOY.

OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT\n\n               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment \n               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, \n               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the \n               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip \n               through Spectre.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         I had just left Ashton, and was on \n                         my way to discover my destiny. Not \n                         knowing what that would be exactly, \n                         I explored every opportunity that \n                         presented itself.\n\n               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.\n\n               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT\n\n               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act \n               to tremendous APPLAUSE.\n\n               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster \n               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be \n               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think \n                         you've seen the unusual. You may \n                         think you've seen the bizarre. But \n                         I've travelled to the five corners \n                         of the world, and let me tell you, \n                         I've never seen anything like this.\n\n               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards \n               the crowd.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         When I found this man, he was picking \n                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers \n                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- \n                         because when you were working beside \n                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He \n                         could take a whole tree in his hands \n                         and shake off the fruit. I had to \n                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I \n                         could take him with me.\n\n               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a \n               quieter moment.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this \n                         man wanted to, he could crush your \n                         head between his toes.\n                              (she trembles)\n                         But he won't.\n                              (a long beat)\n                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, \n                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. \n                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you \n                         Colossus!\n\n               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL \n               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.\n\n               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. \n               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. \n               Intrigued.\n\n               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. \n               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is \n               COLOSSUS.\n\n               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he \n               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and \n               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.\n\n               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus \n               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at \n               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight \n               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.\n\n               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with \n               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.\n\n               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is \n               sitting on the dirt --\n\n               KARL THE GIANT\n\n               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold \n               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP \n               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will \n               happen next?\n\n               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.\n\n               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned \n               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into \n               the shadows.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

For no good reason, she \n               looks back at Edward.\n\n               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.\n\n               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A \n               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a \n               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.\n\n               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the \n               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and \n               closer to this woman.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         They say when you meet the love of \n                         your life, time stops. And that's \n                         true. What they don't tell you, is \n                         that once time starts again, it moves \n                         extra fast to catch up.\n\n               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and \n               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's \n               frozen, helpless in time.\n\n               EXT.

BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT\n\n               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to \n               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it \n               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are \n               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward \n               is dead.\n\n               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes \n               Edward antsier.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         From that moment on, I did everything \n                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of \n                         things he didn't. I'd go three days \n                         without stopping to eat, and four \n                         days without sleeping.\n\n               EXT.

One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the \n               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the \n               air.\n\n               EXT.

He dodges \n               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.\n\n               He catches his breath, lucky.\n\n               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him \n               in the shoulder.\n\n               EXT.

AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT\n\n               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, \n               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. \n               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.\n\n               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I \n                         need to talk to you.\n\n               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the \n               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.\n\n               Edward turns the knob.\n\n               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a \n               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green \n               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.\n\n               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his \n               throat. \n\n               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but \n               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold \n               on tight.\n\n               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES \n               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of \n               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.\n\n               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls \n               to his feet.\n\n               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready \n               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming \n               the revolver at the dog.\n\n               At the last moment...\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         No, wait!\n\n               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches \n               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.\n\n               The carnies GASP.\n\n               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, \n               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of \n               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, \n               ready to strike it.\n\n               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces \n               excitedly, ready to play fetch.\n\n               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he \n               can. The dog bounds after it,\n\n               SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.\n\n               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it \n               drops at Edward's feet.

The door opens to reveal the \n               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's \n               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.\n\n               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, \n               nervous.

Because I am \n                         destined to marry you. I knew that \n                         from the first moment I saw you at \n                         the circus.

Written on the \n               projector is \"I Love Sandra Templeton.\" She's horrified and \n               excited at the same time.

WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]\n\n               The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected \n               in The Eye.\n\n                                                         RETURNING BACK TO:\n\n               EXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back \n               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Don!\n\n               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.\n\n               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible \n               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I will never marry you.\n\n               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.\n\n               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting \n               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?\n\n                                     DON PRICE\n                         What. You love this guy?\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         He's almost a stranger and I prefer \n                         him to you. \n\n               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. \n               But not before decking Edward one last time.\n\n               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the \n               daffodils.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         How can I convince you to stop?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Go out with me.\n\n               He smiles, his teeth bloody.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Okay.\n\n               As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP \n               above the flowered battlefield.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         As it turned out, Sandra was able to \n                         keep her same date at the chapel. \n                         Only the groom had changed.\n\n               As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire \n               glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]\n\n               Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the \n               stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)\n                         Is it the medicine that's making you \n                         thirsty?\n\n                                     EDWARD (O.S.)\n                         Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole \n                         life. Never really known why.\n\n               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but \n               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few \n               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.\n\n               INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         There was one time when I was \n                         eleven...\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                              (gently)\n                         You were talking about your wedding.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I didn't forget. I was just working \n                         on a tangent. See, most men, they'll \n                         tell a story straight through, and \n                         it won't be complicated, but it won't \n                         be interesting either.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         I like your stories.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         And I like you.\n\n               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. \n               There's a story to be told.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now. The thing about working for a \n                         circus is you don't have a regular \n                         address, and after three years I had \n                         a lot of undelivered mail.\n\n               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself \n               listen to the story one more time.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         During the four weeks I was in the \n                         hospital, the postmaster finally \n                         caught up with me.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail \n               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking \n               letter. Reading it, his face drops.\n\n               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         It turned out that while my heart \n                         belonged to Sandra, the rest of my \n                         body belonged to the U.S. Government.\n\n               INT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT\n\n               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a \n               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, \n               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         A hitch in the Army was up to three \n                         years at that point, and having waited \n                         three years just to meet Sandra, I \n                         knew I couldn't survive being away \n                         from her that long. So I took every \n                         hazardous assignment I could find, \n                         with the hope of getting my time \n                         down to less than a year.\n\n               The JUMP LEADER yells...\n\n                                     JUMP LEADER\n                         GO! GO! GO!\n\n               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main \n               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...\n\n               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.\n\n               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking \n               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the \n               darkness. They're already long gone.\n\n               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting \n               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the \n               plane.\n\n               EXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT\n\n               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the \n               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.\n\n               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. \n               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every \n               act is fundamentally the same.\n\n               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's \n               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. \n               The Emcee makes a \"shoot him in the neck\" motion to one of \n               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.\n\n               EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT\n\n               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. \n               He can't steer. He's helpless.\n\n               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. \n               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough \n               cover for Edward to remain unseen.\n\n               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. \n               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the \n               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited \n               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless \n               cricket left on the anthill.\n\n               EXT. ON STAGE\n\n               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's \n               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.\n\n               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a \n               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their \n               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.\n\n               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. \n               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.\n\n               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an \n               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.\n\n                                     PING\n                         Sometimes a girl can feel so alone \n                         Without a lover to call her own. \n                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to \n                         explode. \n                         Wants to grab the first man she sees \n                         and tear off his clothes.\n\n               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.\n\n               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of \n               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up\n\n               BACKSTAGE.\n\n               His determined opponent follows him down.\n\n                                     PING (CONT'D)\n                         But she won't.\n                         No, she can't. \n                         She needs a special special different \n                         unusual man. \n                         Because that girl, \n                         Who looks like me, \n                         She has wants, but she has needs.\n\n                                     PING\n                              (speaking)\n                         Any of you got needs?\n\n               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.\n\n               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.\n\n                                     PING\n                              (chorus)\n                         I've had twice the adventure, \n                         Cried double the tears. \n                         Two times the bad times in half the \n                         years. \n                         I need a strong man, because I've \n                         got \n                         Twice the love to give.\n\n               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was \n               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of\n\n               SIAMESE TWINS.\n\n               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all \n               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, \n               one set of perfect legs beneath them.\n\n               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It \n               costs him a punch to the jaw.\n\n                                     PING\n                         Say hello, Jing.\n\n                                     JING\n                         Hello Jing.\n\n                                     PING\n                              (to the crowd)\n                         I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good \n                         one.\n                              (closer)\n                         I'm the bad one.\n\n               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the \n               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.\n\n               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final \n               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, \n               their backs forming the curves.\n\n               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.\n\n               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. \n               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing\n\n               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.\n\n               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee \n               yells for the Guards to search.\n\n               ON STAGE\n\n               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her \n               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.\n\n               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and \n               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, \n               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities \n               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, \n               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.\n\n               In Chinese, subtitled...\n\n                                     PING\n                         How could you miss your cue?

TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         And so the twins and I began our \n                         arduous journey halfway around the \n                         world. Unfortunately, there was no \n                         way to send a message back to America.\n\n               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         And so it was no surprise that the \n                         Army believed I was dead.\n\n               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout \n               makes church bells RING.\n\n               EXT. BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a \n               tunnel of fabric.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         After four months, Sandra had gotten \n                         over the worst of the nightmares. \n                         When the phone rang, she didn't think \n                         it was somehow me calling her. When \n                         a car drove past, she didn't get up \n                         to check out the window.\n\n               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see\n\n               A MAN'S SILHOUETTE\n\n               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow \n               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the \n               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.\n\n               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she \n               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.\n\n               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing \n               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. \n               It is destiny.\n\n               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.\n\n                                                              CROSSFADE TO:\n\n               BRIGHT SUNLIGHT\n\n               filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a \n               man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, \n               then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be\n\n               JOSEPHINE.\n\n               She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. \n               He's been up for a while. We are actually...\n\n               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY\n\n               ...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind \n               of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling.

And I started thinking -- \n                         maybe he has a second life somewhere \n                         else. With another house, another \n                         family. He leaves us, he goes to \n                         them. Or maybe there is no family. \n                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But \n                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that \n                         second life better. And the reason \n                         he tells all those stories is because \n                         he can't stand this boring place.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         But it's not true.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         What is \"true?\" I've never heard my \n                         father say a single true thing.\n\n               Off her silence...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Look, I know why you like him.

The pool has long \n               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, \n               slime covering the cemented rocks.\n\n               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's \n               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which \n               disappears into the murky water.\n\n               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He \n               casually walks away.\n\n               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY\n\n               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring \n               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of \n               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built \n               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian \n               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to \n               sell.\n\n               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its \n               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit \n               beside it.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Your father decided he needed to \n                         have an office, and it wouldn't do \n                         to have it in the house. You'll know \n                         better than me what's important.\n\n               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a \n               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to \n               being startled.\n\n               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]\n\n               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash \n               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, \n               Sandra makes a small sound.

Will re-reads the \n               telegram, still bewildered.\n\n               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange \n               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.\n\n               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device \n               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the \n               hand.\n\n               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         After the war, the sons of Alabama \n                         returned home, looking for work. \n                         Each had an advantage over me.

Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five \n               fingers and a thumb.

He takes the guard's gun.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                              (to the crowd)\n                         Now, I want all of you to lie down. \n                         I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash \n                         drawers, and my associate here is \n                         going to handle the vault. \n                              (pointing to a Teller \n                              Woman)\n                         You help my friend, okay?\n\n               The TELLER WOMAN nods.\n\n               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he \n               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is \n               already waving him to the back.\n\n               He decides he better go.\n\n               INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY\n\n               The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. \n               Edward feels horrible.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Look, I'm really sorry.

EDWARD'S CAR - DAY\n\n               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're \n               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following \n               them. It's an empty country road for miles.\n\n               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! \n                         Not bad for just the drawers. Let's \n                         see what you got from the vault.\n\n               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through \n               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single \n               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little \n               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         This is it?

There's something you \n                         should know, Norther. You see, the \n                         reason why...\n\n               Edward continues his narration...\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         I told Norther about the vagaries of \n                         Texas oil money and its effect on \n                         real estate prices, and how lax \n                         enforcement of fiduciary process had \n                         made savings and loans particularly \n                         vulnerable.\n\n               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:\n\n               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY\n\n               Norther leans in the driver's side window.\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         I should go to Wall Street. That's \n                         where all the money is.\n\n               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         I knew then that while my days as a \n                         criminal were over, Norther's were \n                         just beginning.\n\n               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the \n               last moment, Norther calls out:\n\n                                     NORTHER WINSLOW\n                         Edward, thank you for the hand!\n\n               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON \n               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         When Norther made his first million \n                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten \n                         thousand. I protested, but he said \n                         it was my fee as his career advisor.\n\n               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY\n\n               Sandra is watering the garden.

But it was enough to \n                         buy my wife a proper house with a \n                         white picket fence.\n\n               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. \n               Edward kisses his wife.\n\n                                     EDWARD (V.O.)\n                         And for that, it was all the riches \n                         a man could ever want.\n\n               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.\n\n                                                             TRANSITION TO:\n\n               INT.

It's \n               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the \n               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.\n\n               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. \n               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find\n\n               SANDRA\n\n               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly \n               worried -- her husband has always done this.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I was drying out.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I see.

We can spray \n                         you like a fern.\n\n               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in \n               the tub. A beat while she considers.\n\n               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, \n               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.\n\n               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has \n               tears hanging in her eyes.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Come now.\n\n               He wipes them away.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I don't think I'll ever dry out.\n\n               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY\n\n               Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another \n               file cabinet.

A LONE HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels \n               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through \n               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.\n\n               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He \n               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded \n               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. \n               Will notices this.\n\n               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside.

JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n               While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she \n               never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         How did you know my father?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         This was on his sales route, so he \n                         was through here all the time. \n                         Everyone in town knew him.\n\n               A beat. Not flinching...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Were you and my father having an \n                         affair?\n\n                                     JENNY\n                              (taken aback)\n                         Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was \n                         expecting to dance around this for \n                         another half hour.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I've seen him with women. He flirts. \n                         He always has. On some level, I \n                         presumed he was cheating on my mother. \n                         I just never had proof.\n\n               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her \n               into. Once she's finally free...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Can I ask you a question? Why did \n                         you come here today? If you found \n                         this deed, why didn't you just ask \n                         Eddie?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Because he's dying.\n\n               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. \n               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Look, I don't know how much you want \n                         to know about any of this. You have \n                         one image of your father and it would \n                         be wrong for me to go and change it. \n                         Especially this late in the game.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         My father talked about a lot of things \n                         he never did, and I'm sure he did a \n                         lot of things he never talked about. \n                         I'm just trying to reconcile the \n                         two.\n\n               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         The first thing you have to \n                         understand, is that your father never \n                         meant to end up here. And yet he \n                         did, twice. The first time, he was \n                         early. The second time, he was late.\n\n               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT\n\n               It's late, and Edward is pensive.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Those days, your father was working \n                         for himself. If there was one thing \n                         you could say about Edward Bloom, \n                         it's that he was a social person, \n                         and people took a liking to him. One \n                         night he was returning from three \n                         weeks on the road, when he hit a \n                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.\n\n               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the \n               wipers.\n\n               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]\n\n               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- \n               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught \n               in a waterfall. It's that loud.\n\n               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just \n               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but \n               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --\n\n               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, \n               but where there used to be air is water.\n\n               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.\n\n               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is \n               trickling in through the crack between the window and the \n               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.\n\n               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.\n\n               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face \n               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, \n               as the first time we saw her.\n\n               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet \n               hers. And smiles.\n\n                                                              FLASH CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY\n\n               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees \n               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.\n\n               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his \n               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from\n\n               HIS CAR,\n\n               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As \n               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny \n               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, \n               rubs it off.\n\n               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Fate has a way of circling back on a \n                         man, and taking him by surprise.\n\n               EXT. ROAD - DAY\n\n               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a \n               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...\n\n                                  \"Welcome to Spectre.\"\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n\n               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the \n               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to \n               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, \n               along with the rest of the town's.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         A man sees things differently at \n                         different times in his life. This \n                         town didn't seem the same now that \n                         he was older.\n\n               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS\n\n               We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are \n               \"FOR SALE\" signs in many of the windows\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         A new road had brought the outside \n                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, \n                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere \n                         you looked, people were bankrupt.\n\n               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY\n\n               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward \n               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among \n               the bidders.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Two different corporations were \n                         looking at buying the town, if they \n                         could get the price low enough. One \n                         wanted to open a chicken processing \n                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. \n                         Either way, Spectre would be \n                         destroyed.\n\n               Edward raises his hand.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Fifty-thousand!\n\n               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         And so Edward Bloom decided to buy \n                         the town, in order to save it.\n\n               INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY\n\n               Edward pitches his plan to Norther.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         He was never a wealthy man, but he \n                         had made other men rich, and now he \n                         asked for their favors.\n\n               INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY\n\n               VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward \n               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Most of them had never seen Spectre -- \n                         they only had Edward's words to \n                         describe it. That's all they needed. \n                         He sold them on the dream.\n\n                                     JING\n                         You can structure it as a historical \n                         trust. But you'll need every \n                         contiguous piece of property. It's \n                         all or nothing.\n\n               As Edward takes notes...\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         So first he bought the farms. Then \n                         he bought the houses. Then he bought \n                         the stores.\n\n               INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY\n\n               Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Whatever he bought, the people were \n                         not asked to leave or pay rent or \n                         anything. They were just asked to \n                         keep doing as they were doing. In \n                         that way, he could make sure the \n                         town would never die.\n\n               EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY\n\n               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally \n               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the \n               trees' thick canopy.\n\n                                     JENNY (V.O.)\n                         Within six months, his trust had \n                         purchased the entire town. With one \n                         exception.\n\n               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. \n               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around \n               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.\n\n               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS \n               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.\n\n               INT. SHACK - DAY\n\n               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire \n               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.\n\n               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. \n               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to \n               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You must be Edward Bloom.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         How did you know?\n\n               She keeps PLAYING.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         No one would come out here unless \n                         they had business. And no one would \n                         have business with me except for \n                         you. You're buying the town.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Apparently I've overlooked this one \n                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy \n                         that. You see, in order for the town \n                         to be preserved, the trust must own \n                         it in its entirety.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         So I've heard.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'll offer you more than it's worth. \n                         And you know you won't have to move. \n                         Nothing will change except the name \n                         on the deed, you have my word.\n\n               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns \n               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Now let me get this straight. You'll \n                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay \n                         in it. You'll own the house, but \n                         it'll still be mine.

You can ask anyone in town. \n                         I've been nothing if not generous.

Some sort of midlife crisis? \n                         Instead of buying a convertible, you \n                         buy a town?\n\n               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really \n               asked before.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Helping people makes me happy.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         I'm not convinced you should be happy.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'm sorry.

SWAMP SHACK - DAY\n\n               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it \n               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping \n               for.\n\n               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.\n\n               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they \n               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I'm sorry.\n\n               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps \n               slipping.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         It's okay, just leave it.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I can get it.

It holds for a beat then \n               falls in, SMASHING a small table.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Lord, I'm sorry I...\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         Please.

Weighing the scales of chivalry, he \n               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.\n\n               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's \n               something more in her feelings for him.

SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY\n\n               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.\n\n               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to \n               see the shack is now\n\n               THE LOVELY HOUSE\n\n               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and \n               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is \n               impossibly charming.\n\n               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. \n               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. \n               And watching him with deepest affection.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Of course, the best part was creating \n                         new material. By the time the twins \n                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole \n                         new routine worked out for them, \n                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.\n\n               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and \n               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.\n\n               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's \n               no reason for him to be staying any longer.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I suppose I should...\n\n               He takes his hat off the rack.\n\n                                     JENNY\n                         You can leave it there.\n\n               A beat. Does she really mean it?\n\n               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his \n               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- \n               just a half-inch from kissing him when --\n\n               -- Edward gently holds her back.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         No.\n\n               She freezes, stunned and humiliated.

BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK\n\n               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to \n               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.\n\n               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK\n\n               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. \n               Will sets his keys on the table.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK\n\n               Will looks in. Empty.\n\n                                     WILL\n                              (calling out)\n                         Hello? Mom? Dad?\n\n               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK\n\n               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He \n               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.\n\n               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK\n\n               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. \n               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.\n\n               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down \n               the stairs.\n\n               INT. FOYER - DUSK\n\n               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, \n               where the \"MESSAGE\" light blinks on the answering machine.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT\n\n               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick \n               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the \n               information desk, so Will forges ahead.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place \n               to start. Then, behind him --\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)\n                         Will!\n\n               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She \n               was calling him.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Your father had a stroke.

How can she answer?\n\n               He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of \n               course his father's not going to be okay.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         What I mean is, will he get back to \n                         the way he was when...\n\n               She cuts him off --\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         No. He won't. I'm sorry.\n\n               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the \n               news.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. \n               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's \n               mercifully quiet.\n\n               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself \n               together, but it's been a tough day.\n\n               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third \n               time.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I don't suppose one of us could stay \n                         with him.

Thank you.\n\n               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine \n               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.\n\n               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his \n               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.\n\n                                                             TRANSITION TO:\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a \n               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable \n               but refusing to surrender to it.\n\n               Josephine emerges.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         I'm sorry. It seems every hour I \n                         have to...\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I know. It was the same when I was \n                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.\n\n               The two women start to walk, no hurry.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         Do you like it, being pregnant?\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         I do.\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but \n                         I loved every minute of it. I did. \n                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he \n                         was gone, but I felt like I always \n                         had a piece of him with me. A little \n                         part of his soul inside me. I could \n                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.\n\n               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She \n               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...\n\n                                     SANDRA\n                         I really miss that.\n\n               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.\n\n                                     JOSEPHINE\n                         Don't stop. Don't.\n\n               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The \n               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment \n               be.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the \n               crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his \n               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.\n\n                                     DR.

It's one of \n                         my greatest annoyances, when people \n                         talk to those who can't hear them.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         My father and I have an advantage. \n                         We never talk.\n\n               Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         How long have you known my father?\n\n                                     DR.

He doesn't have \n               one.\n\n               Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.\n\n                                     DR. BENNETT\n                         Did your father ever tell you about \n                         the day you were born?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         A thousand times.

Did he \n                         ever tell you that?\n\n                                     WILL\n                              (suddenly interested)\n                         No.\n\n                                     DR. BENNETT\n                         Your mother came in about three in \n                         the afternoon. Her neighbor drove \n                         her, on account of your father was \n                         on business in Wichita. You were \n                         born a week early, but there were no \n                         complications. It was a perfect \n                         delivery. Now, your father was sorry \n                         to miss it, but it wasn't the custom \n                         for the men to be in the room for \n                         deliveries then, so I can't see as \n                         it would have been much different \n                         had he been there. And that's the \n                         real story of how you were born.\n\n               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors \n               being paged.\n\n                                     DR.

And I \n                         suppose if I had to choose between \n                         the true version and an elaborate \n                         one involving a fish and a wedding \n                         ring, I might choose the fancy \n                         version. But that's just me.\n\n               Will half-smiles.\n\n               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will \n               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and \n               starts making a list.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS\n\n               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.\n\n               He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he \n               looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly\n\n                                                              CROSSFADE TO:\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN\n\n               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is \n               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, \n               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, \n               the pen in his hand.\n\n               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What \n               woke him up?\n\n               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Dad?\n\n               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes \n               are open, scared and confused.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?\n\n               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his \n               finger on the orange \"nurse call\" button, but doesn't push \n               it.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         What can I do? Can I help? Can I get \n                         you something? Water?\n\n               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the \n               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward \n               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                              (whispering)\n                         The river.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         The river?\n\n               It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. \n               It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this \n               world.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Tell me how it happens.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         How what happens?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         How I go.\n\n               ON WILL, realizing...\n\n                                     WILL\n                         You mean what you saw in The Eye?\n\n               Edward nods.

There's nothing else to do.\n\n               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He \n               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's \n               coming. Without the story, he's lost.\n\n               Fighting the urge to panic --\n\n                                     WILL\n                         I can try, Dad. If you help.

Okay.\n\n               Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks \n               to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.\n\n               ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Okay.

Will dashes to catch up with \n               him.\n\n               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         Security!

Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, \n               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.\n\n               Will pops the trunk.

He HONKS, trying to \n               get around the jam. But it's no use.\n\n               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive \n               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.\n\n               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.\n\n               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY\n\n               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of \n               more than 100 waiting.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         As we get closer to the river, we \n                         see everybody's already there.

We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the \n               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a \n               day since we saw them last.\n\n               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, \n               Norther Winslow.

RIVERSIDE - DAY\n\n               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. \n               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl \n               comes just after that.\n\n               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. \n               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.\n\n               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He \n               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. \n               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.\n\n               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As \n               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the \n               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         And the strange thing is, there's \n                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's \n                         just so glad to see you, and send \n                         you off right.\n\n               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so \n               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell!

Will turns \n               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.\n\n               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an \n               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than \n               we've ever seen her.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         My girl in the river.\n\n               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in \n               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only \n               Will is there to witness.\n\n               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. \n               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free \n               with his teeth.\n\n               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the \n               ring out of his mouth.\n\n               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For \n               he's no longer a man, but rather\n\n               A FAT CATFISH\n\n               swimming at his feet.\n\n               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, \n               disappearing.\n\n               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching \n               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back \n               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.\n\n               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...\n\n               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, \n               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives \n               back under with a SPLASH.\n\n                                                         CROSSFADE BACK TO:\n\n               INT.

Exactly.\n\n               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale \n               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of \n               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.\n\n               And this is how he goes.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The \n               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.\n\n               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see \n               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. \n               The other end answers.\n\n                                     WILL\n                              (voice cracking)\n                         Hi.\n\n               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. \n               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.\n\n               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.\n\n               INT.

BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will \n               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on \n               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.\n\n               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to \n               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied \n               to\n\n               THE KEY TO THE CITY.\n\n               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY\n\n               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-\n               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.\n\n               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. \n               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than \n               expected.\n\n               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see \n               an Oldsmobile parking.\n\n               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.\n\n               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely \n               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be \n               70.\n\n               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.\n\n               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT \n               UP to see this man is huge.\n\n               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least \n               six-eight.\n\n               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY\n\n               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother \n               to a seat near the grave.\n\n               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN \n               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses \n               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.\n\n               It's PING and JING.\n\n               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. \n               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing \n               steps forward. They're really two separate people. \n\n               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: \n               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]\n\n               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. \n               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling \n               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.\n\n               We find Will watching them.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         Have you ever heard a joke so many \n                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? \n                         But then you hear it again and \n                         suddenly it's new. You remember why \n                         you loved it in the first place.\n\n               Will joins in, laughing.\n\n               We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the \n               screen.\n\n                                                             TRANSITION TO:\n\n               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]\n\n               Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching \n               his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.\n\n                                     SON\n                              (to the other boys)\n                         So he said he'd fight the giant who \n                         was fifteen feet tall.\n\n                                     KID\n                         No way.\n\n                                     SON\n                              (calling over)\n                         Dad, that's right, isn't it?\n\n                                     WILL\n                         Something like that.\n\n                                     SON\n                         See. So he was a giant but my grampa \n                         was going to fight him because he \n                         wasn't afraid of anything because \n                         he'd seen how he was going to die in \n                         this old lady's glass eye...\n\n               Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra \n               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.\n\n                                     WILL (V.O.)\n                         That was my father's final joke I \n                         guess. A man tells his stories so \n                         many times he becomes the stories. \n                         They live on after him.\n\n                                                              CROSSFADE TO:\n\n               EXT.
