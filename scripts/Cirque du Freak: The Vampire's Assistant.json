Neon green\n          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.\n          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR\n          appears from the bottom of frame.\n          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,\n          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg\n          tentatively through the air...\n\n<b>                         DARREN'S VOICE\n</b>          Come on... Just a little lower...\n          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on\n          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over\n          his head, is DARREN SHAN.\n          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.\n           The spider just hangs there.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Come on... I'll take good care of\n          you. All the bugs you can eat.\n\n<b>          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM\n</b>          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,\n          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.\n          Maybe that's why they're friends.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Hey, Darren!\n          No answer.

It's three to nothing.\n          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Your problem, Steve, not mine...\n          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing\n          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.\n          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and\n          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its\n          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.\n          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve\n          who flashes a wicked grin...\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY\n</b>\n          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren\n          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles\n          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          GOAL! Three to one!\n          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.\n          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!\n          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just\n          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>\n<b>                         (EXULTANT)\n</b>          Three to two!\n          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers\n          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          What does that prove? Huh?\n          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous\n          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.\n          Lunch's almost over.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          3.\n</b>\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          That's why he kicked it. To kill\n          time. Well, I still got time to\n          kick your face.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>\n<b>                         (BLOCKING HIM)\n</b>          Forget it. The ball.\n          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.\n\n<b>                         GOALIE\n</b>          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.\n          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.\n\n<b>                         THE STREET\n</b>          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.\n          From seemingly out of nowhere...\n          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking\n          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.\n          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          You idiot!\n          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve\n          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.\n          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.\n          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The\n          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve\n          notices, snatches it out of the air.\n          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear\n          down the street. Creepy...\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Look at this.\n          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath\n          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and\n          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20\n          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          .Human oddities and other living\n          curiosities...\n\n<b>                         (TO DARREN)\n</b>          Other.

There are tire tracks on the\n          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the\n          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS\n</b>          Probing the confines of its glass prison.

DALTON\n</b>          As you can see reptiles and\n          amphibians are not one in the same.\n          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,\n          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various\n          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...\n          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.\n          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.\n          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen\n          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.\n          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet\n          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same\n          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.\n          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>\n<b>          1923...\n</b>\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Must be a different one.\n          Steve scrolls down through pictures:\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          5.\n</b>          Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.\n          Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.\n          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...\n          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is\n          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from\n          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.\n          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall\n          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          I gotta show you something...\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          EXT.

Only the light from the half-closed\n          blinds streaking the floor where:\n          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and\n          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with\n          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack\n          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          I don't get it.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Vampires.

Like at the\n          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at\n          the same time the Russians and\n          Germans were fighting.\n          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Some people know about it.

A low murmur on the other side.\n          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...\n\n<b>          THE ZEITERION THEATER\n</b>          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once\n          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those\n          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching\n          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.\n          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of\n          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a\n          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.\n          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.\n          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second\n          stage light goes out.\n          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,\n          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the\n          trumpets and all is silent.\n          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it\n          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.\n          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.\n          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage\n          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..\n          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!\n          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of\n          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body\n          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the\n          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain\n          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.\n          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are\n          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.\n          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.\n\n<b>          MR. TALL\n</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to\n          the Cirque du Freak. We are an\n          ancient circus.

Our\n          freaks are not people in masks.\n          They are not harmless misfits.\n          What you see tonight is real. Each\n          performer unique. None harmless.\n          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the\n          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-\n          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.\n          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of\n          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin\n          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN\n          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.\n          Even the Wolfman takes notice.\n\n<b>          MR. TALL\n</b>          Beauty and the beast.\n          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper\n          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.\n          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,\n          step out and start to push the cage off stage.\n          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same\n          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.\n          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.\n          Some in the audience recoil.\n          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...\n          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE\n          &amp; SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back\n          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.\n          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like\n          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each\n          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like\n          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.\n          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The\n          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.\n          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The\n          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          15.\n</b>\n<b>                         RHAMUS\n</b>          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And\n          I do have two.\n          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in\n          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus\n          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's\n          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.\n          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and\n          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.\n          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it\n          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can\n          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.\n          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows\n          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the\n          sound of metal shifting inside.\n          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out\n          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on\n          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.\n          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his\n          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.\n          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.\n          Darren &amp; Steve break into applause. So does the audience.\n          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An\n          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out\n          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.\n          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises\n          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly\n          transfixed by the light. But in reality...\n          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)\n          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged\n          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists\n          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.\n          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.\n          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body\n          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!\n          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the\n          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides\n          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.\n          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          16.\n</b>\n<b>                         DARREN &amp; STEVE\n</b>\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          He's as old as us.\n\n<b>                         STAGE\n</b>          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake\n          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber\n          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back\n          to look him in the eye. And then...\n          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like\n          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.\n          More applause from the audience.\n          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at\n          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...\n          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's\n          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --\n\n<b>          LARTEN CREPSLEY!\n</b>          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from\n          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his\n          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.\n\n<b>                         DARREN &amp; STEVE\n</b>          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes.

The crowd mumble nervously. And just\n          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the\n          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.\n\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          It's not true. That all tarantulas\n          are poisonous. Though some can\n          kill a man. With one bite.\n          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA\n          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out\n          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Reacts.

Madam Octa. Pray that\n          she never learns yours.\n          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the\n          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley\n          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.\n          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The\n          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.\n          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.\n          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.\n          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.\n          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.\n\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          No...? Shall it be life?\n          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They\n          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.\n          Crepsley faces the audience.\n\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          I wonder if you would be as shocked\n          to see the same fate for me?\n          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --\n          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then\n          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.\n\n<b>                         DARREN &amp; STEVE\n</b>          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has\n          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.\n\n<b>                         STAGE\n</b>          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.\n\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          Though we have been together such a\n          long time, she is no pet. I think\n          she would quite enjoy killing me.\n          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN\n          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          18.\n</b>\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          For her bite there is no cure.\n          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence\n          about to be directed at her master.\n          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts\n          to play, as simple as it is evocative.\n          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,\n          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She\n          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.\n          She sways; she's dancing!\n          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley\n          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about\n          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.\n          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it\n          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She\n          sails up high over Crepsley's head.\n          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She\n          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.\n          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her\n          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.\n          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage\n          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.\n          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing\n          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the\n          gloom. It's too dark.\n          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light\n          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.\n\n<b>          MR.

What happens to us\n          all, can happen to any of us.\n          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion\n          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          19.\n</b>          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the\n          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.\n          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Let's get outta here.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          No, you go.

What're you doing?\n          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is\n          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.\n          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.\n          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.\n          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands\n          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          That car today. It was a sign.\n          Sending me here.

Darren stops\n          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR\n          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Steve...?\n          No answer.

But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two\n          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.\n          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a\n          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs\n          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his\n          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside\n          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of\n          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches\n          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          21.\n</b>\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be\n          filled with BLOOD.

Stops the point of the\n          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A\n          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is\n          resurgent. He throws Steve off.\n          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches\n          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other.

The factory floor 70 feet below.\n\n<b>                         EVRA\n</b>          Hey, be careful.\n\n<b>                         SAM\n</b>          Don't worry.

Darren and Evra gasp.\n          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          You're crazy!\n\n<b>                         DEBBIE\n</b>          How about you?\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          I got nothing to prove.\n\n<b>                         DEBBIE\n</b>          But it'd be easier for you than me.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Why's that?\n\n<b>                         DEBBIE\n</b>          Because chickens have wings.\n          She starts chicken CLUCKING.

Darren sighs, then\n          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.\n          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top\n          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.\n          Looks like a ballerina.\n          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.\n\n<b>                         EVRA\n</b>          Come on, guys...\n          Darren hesitates.

Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.\n          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.\n          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter\n          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren\n          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.\n\n<b>                         DEBBIE\n</b>          There definitely something\n          different about you.

As they start off...\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.\n\n<b>                         DARREN'S POV\n</b>          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.\n\n<b>                         RAFTER\n</b>          Darren legs go out and he falls off.

Steve looms, smiling.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>\n<b>                         (SMILES)\n</b>          And your sister. She was moving\n          into your room.

Oddly:\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Did you steal money from my mom's\n          purse?\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          What?\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Did you?\n          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Why do you ask? Is knowing that\n          gonna help you rest in peace?\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          No. It's just practically the last\n          thing that ever happened between me\n          and my dad was I was arguing with\n          him.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>\n<b>                         (FLIP)\n</b>          Least you had a dad to argue with.\n          A fury building in Darren.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          I was telling him he was wrong\n          about you.

How do you think we got the\n          money for the dumb tickets? I took\n          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.\n          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs\n          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,\n          no matter how many times Steve hits him.\n\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          112.\n</b>          WHAM!

Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.\n          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...\n          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he\n          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will\n          fall into the spikes below.\n          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.\n\n<b>                         CREPSLEY\n</b>          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you\n          won't have to do it later.\n          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>\n<b>                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)\n</b>          No. He used to be my friend.\n          Darren flings Steve back the other way.

Darren\n          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.\n\n<b>                         STEVE\n</b>          Next time...\n          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.\n          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.\n\n<b>                         DEBBIE\n</b>          Sam?\n          Darren shakes his head.

As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.\n\n<b>                         DARREN\n</b>          Half human.

There's no in\n          between. And the power of being\n          alone is never going to be greater\n          than the weakness.
