Neon green\n          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.\n          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR\n          appears from the bottom of frame.\n          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,\n          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg\n          tentatively through the air...\n\n                         DARREN'S VOICE\n          Come on... Just a little lower...\n          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on\n          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over\n          his head, is DARREN SHAN.\n          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.\n           The spider just hangs there.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Come on... I'll take good care of\n          you. All the bugs you can eat.\n\n          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM\n          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,\n          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.\n          Maybe that's why they're friends.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Hey, Darren!\n          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can\n          see any feet in front of the bowls.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Did you fall in? Darren!\n\n                         DARREN'S VOICE\n          Shhh...\n          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.\n          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.\n\n                         DARREN\n          You're gonna scare him away.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          2.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Man, we're getting killed out\n          there. It's three to nothing.\n          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Your problem, Steve, not mine...\n          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing\n          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.\n          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and\n          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its\n          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.\n          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve\n          who flashes a wicked grin...\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY\n\n          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren\n          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles\n          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:\n\n                         STEVE\n          GOAL! Three to one!\n          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.\n          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!\n          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just\n          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.\n\n                         STEVE\n\n                         (EXULTANT)\n          Three to two!\n          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers\n          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.\n\n                         STEVE\n          What does that prove? Huh?\n          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous\n          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.\n          Lunch's almost over.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          3.\n\n                         STEVE\n          That's why he kicked it. To kill\n          time. Well, I still got time to\n          kick your face.\n\n                         DARREN\n\n                         (BLOCKING HIM)\n          Forget it. The ball.\n          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.\n\n                         GOALIE\n          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.\n          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.\n\n                         THE STREET\n          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.\n          From seemingly out of nowhere...\n          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking\n          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.\n          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.\n\n                         STEVE\n          You idiot!\n          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve\n          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.\n          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.\n          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The\n          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve\n          notices, snatches it out of the air.\n          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear\n          down the street. Creepy...\n\n                         STEVE\n          Look at this.\n          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath\n          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and\n          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20\n          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.\n\n                         STEVE\n          .Human oddities and other living\n          curiosities...\n\n                         (TO DARREN)\n          Other. Does that mean not human?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          4.\n          Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.\n\n                         DARREN\n          A freak show. Ever been to one?\n\n                         STEVE\n\n                         (GRINS)\n          Just this school.\n          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the\n          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the\n          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS\n          Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR\n          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because\n          we're inside...\n\n          THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY\n          The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.\n          His voice like a metronome.\n\n          MR. DALTON\n          As you can see reptiles and\n          amphibians are not one in the same.\n          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,\n          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various\n          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...\n          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.\n          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.\n          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen\n          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.\n          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet\n          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same\n          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.\n          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:\n\n                         STEVE\n\n          1923...\n\n                         DARREN\n          Must be a different one.\n          Steve scrolls down through pictures:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          5.\n          Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.\n          Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.\n          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...\n          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is\n          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from\n          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.\n          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall\n          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I gotta show you something...\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. THE SHAN HOUSE - DAY\n\n          Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old\n          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.\n          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two\n          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          INT. DARREN'S ROOM - DAY\n\n          Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed\n          blinds streaking the floor where:\n          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and\n          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with\n          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack\n          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I don't get it.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Vampires. I've been studying them.\n          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Right. You're failing half your\n          classes at school, but you're\n          studying vampires.\n\n                         STEVE\n          They been around 1000's of years.\n          Two tribes.

When?\n\n                         STEVE\n          Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?\n          They fight at the same time. And\n          no one knows it. Like at the\n          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at\n          the same time the Russians and\n          Germans were fighting.\n          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Some people know about it. There\n          have even been books written.\n          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.\n\n                         DARREN\n          That's your proof? It smells.\n          Steve's really trying to convince him now.\n\n                         STEVE\n          It's everywhere if you look. On\n          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,\n          weird places. But you can find it.\n          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I chatted online with one of them.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Come on.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Serious.\n          We become aware of...\n\n          A SINISTER POV\n          Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open\n          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.\n\n                         DARREN\n          What was his name? Mr. Dracula?\n          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th\n          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet\n          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy!

And here 1855.\n          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.\n          Would that make you believe?\n          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.\n          Suddenly Darren spins...\n          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She\n          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.\n\n                         ANNIE\n          How'd you know?\n\n                         DARREN\n          Saw your shadow on the floor.\n          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.\n          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I'm gonna get a soda.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Get me one, too.\n          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          INT. KITCHEN - SHAN HOUSE - DAY\n\n          Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.\n          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in\n          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door\n          open, two sneakered feet behind it.\n\n                         MOM\n          I know you want to fight global\n          warming, Darren, but that's not the\n          way to do it.\n          Steve leans back to show his face.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Sorry, Mrs. Shan.\n\n                         MOM\n          Oh hi, Steve.

She's been working a\n          lot lately.\n          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something\n          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.\n\n                         MOM\n\n                         (POINTS)\n          Glasses are up there.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I know.\n          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to\n          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...\n          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take\n          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.\n          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off\n          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!\n          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,\n          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the\n          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --\n          Darren's Mom is back in.

Not\n          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses\n          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and\n          guilt in the air.

As\n          Annie wonders if she should ask what's up...\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. DARREN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          The moonlight glinting off Darren's spider terrarium.\n          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.\n          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the\n          window. Pulling out the screen, he starts to climb out.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. TRELLIS - SHAN HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n          Darren out his second floor bedroom window, starts to climb\n          down via the trellis. CRACK! A section of the trellis\n          BREAKS under his feet. Darren almost falls, catches hold.\n          He pulls himself over, starts down again.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. UNION STREET - NIGHT\n\n          Part of a dilapidated, mostly abandoned downtown. Noirish.\n          Darren and Steve hurry around a corner.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I came here after your house.\n          There was a van there, guy selling\n          tickets.\n          (holds up tickets)\n          Rest is history.\n          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the\n          ZEITERION THEATER. Deserted, except for a few CANDLES\n          burning on the sidewalk by a door. The wind moans.\n\n                         DARREN\n          You know why they closed it, right?\n          Years ago a kid fell out of the\n          balcony and died.

He shoves Darren.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Get inside.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          INT. ZEITERION LOBBY - NIGHT\n\n          Paint peeling. The walls scribbled on. Most of all - it's\n          dark. Darren and Steve head toward a glow coming from...\n\n                         A HALLWAY\n          They move toward a light at the end. Darren pauses at a\n          darkened staircase. Headed up. He points it out to Steve...\n\n                         DARREN\n          The balcony. Where he fell...\n\n                         VOICE\n          May I help you?\n          They wheel around, react to the sight behind them. MR. TALL.\n          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.\n\n                         STEVE\n          We're here to see the show.\n          He takes an ominous step forward, then holds out a hand.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Ticket.\n          Steve hands it over. Mr. Tall pockets it, looks to Darren.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Do you have your ticket? Darren.\n          Darren starts to hand it over, hesitates. The guy knew his\n          name. Mr. Tall reaches, takes it.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          This way. We're about to begin.\n          Mr. Tall turns on his heel and strides off. As they follow:\n\n                         DARREN\n\n                         (LOW)\n          He knew my name.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Maybe he heard me say it.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          13.\n          Mr. Tall turns a corner, only steps ahead of them. But...\n\n                         AROUND CORNER\n          When they turn it, Mr. Tall is gone. Vanished. Ahead, a\n          threadbare velvet CURTAIN. A low murmur on the other side.\n          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...\n\n          THE ZEITERION THEATER\n          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once\n          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those\n          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching\n          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.\n          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of\n          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a\n          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.\n          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.\n          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second\n          stage light goes out.\n          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,\n          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the\n          trumpets and all is silent.\n          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it\n          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.\n          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.\n          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage\n          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..\n          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!\n          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of\n          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body\n          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the\n          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain\n          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.\n          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are\n          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.\n          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to\n          the Cirque du Freak. We are an\n          ancient circus. We have toured for\n          five hundred years...\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          14.\n          Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          .Bringing the remarkable and\n          grotesque to generations. Our\n          freaks are not people in masks.\n          They are not harmless misfits.\n          What you see tonight is real. Each\n          performer unique. None harmless.\n          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the\n          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-\n          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.\n          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of\n          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin\n          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN\n          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.\n          Even the Wolfman takes notice.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Beauty and the beast.\n          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper\n          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.\n          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,\n          step out and start to push the cage off stage.\n          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same\n          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.\n          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.\n          Some in the audience recoil.\n          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...\n          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE\n          & SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back\n          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.\n          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like\n          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each\n          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like\n          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.\n          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The\n          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.\n          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The\n          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          15.\n\n                         RHAMUS\n          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And\n          I do have two.\n          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in\n          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus\n          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's\n          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.\n          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and\n          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.\n          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it\n          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can\n          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.\n          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows\n          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the\n          sound of metal shifting inside.\n          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out\n          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on\n          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.\n          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his\n          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.\n          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.\n          Darren & Steve break into applause. So does the audience.\n          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An\n          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out\n          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.\n          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises\n          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly\n          transfixed by the light. But in reality...\n          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)\n          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged\n          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists\n          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.\n          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.\n          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body\n          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!\n          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the\n          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides\n          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.\n          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          16.\n\n                         DARREN & STEVE\n\n                         DARREN\n          He's as old as us.\n\n                         STAGE\n          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake\n          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber\n          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back\n          to look him in the eye. And then...\n          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like\n          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.\n          More applause from the audience.\n          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at\n          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...\n          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's\n          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --\n\n          LARTEN CREPSLEY!\n          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from\n          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his\n          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.\n\n                         DARREN & STEVE\n          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the\n          print-out from his pocket, compares.\n\n                         DARREN\n          It's him...\n\n                         STAGE\n          Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just\n          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the\n          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          It's not true. That all tarantulas\n          are poisonous. Though some can\n          kill a man. With one bite.\n          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA\n          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out\n          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Reacts. A spider!\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          17.\n\n                         STAGE\n          Crepsley makes the introduction.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that\n          she never learns yours.\n          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the\n          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley\n          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.\n          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The\n          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.\n          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.\n          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.\n          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.\n          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          No...? Shall it be life?\n          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They\n          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.\n          Crepsley faces the audience.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I wonder if you would be as shocked\n          to see the same fate for me?\n          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --\n          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then\n          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.\n\n                         DARREN & STEVE\n          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has\n          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.\n\n                         STAGE\n          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Though we have been together such a\n          long time, she is no pet. I think\n          she would quite enjoy killing me.\n          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN\n          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          18.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          For her bite there is no cure.\n          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence\n          about to be directed at her master.\n          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts\n          to play, as simple as it is evocative.\n          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,\n          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She\n          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.\n          She sways; she's dancing!\n          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley\n          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about\n          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.\n          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it\n          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She\n          sails up high over Crepsley's head.\n          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She\n          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.\n          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her\n          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.\n          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage\n          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.\n          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing\n          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the\n          gloom. It's too dark.\n          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light\n          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.\n          That is the end of our show.\n\n                         AUDIENCE MAN\n          But... What happened to him?!\n\n          MR. TALL\n          Don't you know? What happens to us\n          all, can happen to any of us.\n          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion\n          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          19.\n          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the\n          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.\n          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Let's get outta here.\n\n                         STEVE\n          No, you go. I'm staying.\n          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Wait. What're you doing?\n          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is\n          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.\n          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.\n          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.\n\n                         STEVE\n          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.\n          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands\n          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.\n\n                         STEVE\n          That car today. It was a sign.\n          Sending me here. I was told\n          there'd be a sign.\n          Too friggin' weird.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Told by who? The guy in the chat\n          room? The internet guy?\n\n                         STEVE\n          I'll tell you later. If I can.\n          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.\n          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Steve...\n          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          20.\n\n          INT. ZEITERION THEATER - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT\n\n          Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts\n          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops\n          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR\n          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Steve...?\n          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA\n          He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he\n          heads further into the dark.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Steve...\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         STEVE\n          Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a\n          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two\n          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.\n          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a\n          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs\n          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his\n          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...\n\n                         STEVE\n          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside\n          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of\n          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches\n          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          21.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Reaches in the fridge, takes out a glass jar that looks to be\n          filled with BLOOD. Steve raises it, swirls it around inside.\n\n                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE\n          Are you looking for me?\n          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!\n          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Rooted to the spot. Watching...\n\n                         STEVE & CREPSLEY\n          Crespley sniffs the air - the spilled blood to be exact.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I -- I know who you are.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Tell me, boy. Who am I?\n\n                         STEVE\n          You're a vampire.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Too broad a definition. Do you\n          introduce yourself as a human? Who\n          I am is Larten Crepsley.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Moving slightly to get a clearer view.\n\n                         STEVE & CREPSLEY\n          Crepsley suddenly DISAPPEARS, REAPPEARS much closer. Steve\n          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Who sent you and what do they want?\n\n                         STEVE\n          Nothing. No one.\n          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Then what do you want?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          22.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I want to join you.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Join me? I don't understand.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I want you to make me a vampire.\n          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there\n          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Is it because you want to live\n          forever? Because we don't.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I don't care about living forever.\n          But you do seem to live a long\n          time.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          A long time alone. Do you want to\n          live alone?\n\n                         STEVE\n          I already do.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Are you an orphan?\n\n                         STEVE\n          My father's gone; my mother doesn't\n          care about me.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Nor mine. You're friendless also?\n\n                         STEVE\n          I have a friend, but he doesn't\n          understand. He's got too much to\n          know what it's like to be alone.\n          As Darren reacts to this...\n\n                         STEVE\n          When you're alone you feel weak.\n          Useless. But I know there must be\n          something strong about it, too. I\n          want to feel the power of being\n          alone. I want to be a vampire.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          23.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          The power of being alone will never\n          be greater than the weakness of it.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I don't care.\n          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a\n          dismissive hand.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          It makes no matter. We do not\n          blood children. I'm sorry.\n          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-\n          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Do you intend to use that on me?\n          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own\n          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Do it. Make me a vampire.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Do not tempt me.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly\n          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's\n          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's\n          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately\n          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.\n\n                         STEVE\n          What's wrong?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          You have bad blood.\n\n                         STEVE\n          What do you mean?\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          24.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I can taste the menace in your\n          blood. You can never be a vampire.\n          You're evil.\n          Steve scrambles to his feet.\n\n                         STEVE\n          That's a lie. You take that back!\n          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Go home.\n          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n\n          GO!\n          Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we\n          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds\n          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over\n          and kicks the fridge door closed.\n          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.\n          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.\n          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage\n          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. STREETS - DARREN'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT\n\n          3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.\n          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips\n          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.\n          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Oh. You want that?\n          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat\n          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          25.\n\n                         DARREN\n          See?

Disheveled,\n          cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.\n          She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.\n\n                         STEVE'S MOM\n          Did you hurt Stevie?!

One pair of hands create a hollow echo.\n          Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.\n          And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a\n          hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet.

And if\n          the shock didn't kill you, your\n          inexperience would. So you become\n          one in stages. A half-vampire at\n          first. With greater strength than\n          a human, but still able to go out\n          in sunlight. You learn from a full\n          vampire.

Regardless, I've left\n          the Cirque. Left my protection. I\n          need someone to protect me while I\n          sleep.

Crepsley smiles.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          You hardly have a choice. It's\n          your destiny.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Destiny? That doesn't make sense.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Try this then. You're reckless\n          enough to steal, responsible enough\n          to come back for a friend. That's\n          enough for me.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Not for me.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Yes, well, destiny can't be\n          explained. It must be lived. Now,\n          you're wasting my time.\n\n                         DARREN\n          There's gotta be another way.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          There isn't.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Please...

Yes or no?\n\n                         DARREN\n          You'd never be able to trust me.\n          If I got a chance for payback I'd\n          take it.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Yes or no?\n          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.\n          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially\n          long, but they look thick and sharp.\n          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws\n          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          You have good blood.\n          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of\n          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.\n          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the\n          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Lift your hands.\n          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into\n          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Get used to pain. More lies ahead.\n          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.\n          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.\n          As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          The blood flows into your left arm\n          and out of your right. Do you feel\n          it? Getting near your heart?\n          Darren nods, shivers.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Almost there.\n          A force arcs through Darren's body.

Only it seems\n          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.\n          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the\n          road a blurred ribbon.

She thinks he's\n          overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.\n\n                         MOM\n          Yeah, it's great news.

Moves toward a corner\n          away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its\n          head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.\n          ZAP! The snake STRIKES...\n          And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below\n          its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!\n          The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown\n          away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.\n          The BELL RINGS. Moment over.

He knocks Darren back on the ground.\n          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.\n          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the\n          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A\n          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is\n          resurgent. He throws Steve off.\n          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches\n          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams\n          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.\n\n                         DARREN\n          What do you have against vampires?\n          You wanted to become one yourself.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Yeah, I wanted to, but you did.\n          You stole my dream.

You told him I was evil.\n          You planned this all along. And\n          you'll pay! You'll pay --\n          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him\n          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I want you to leave...\n          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I want you to leave and forget you\n          ever saw me. Understand?\n          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in\n          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.\n\n                         STEVE\n          I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You\n          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll\n          put a stake in you and burn you to\n          ashes. I'll make sure you never\n          come back from the grave again.\n          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by\n          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          If we ever meet again, I will show\n          you loneliness you cannot imagine.\n          Steve trembles in fear.

A half-vampire like you:\n          one for every five.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I don't understand.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I was born in 1774.

Crepsley motions him to keep up.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I became a vampire when I was 20\n          years old. In 1794.\n\n                         DARREN\n\n          1794?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          In Paris. The days of the Terror.\n          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up\n          and down all day. Really when\n          humans put their minds to it, we\n          vampires can hardly compete.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          59.\n          Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Math. 1794. So I've been a\n          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?\n          Darren nods again, still with him.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211\n          divided by 10, I've aged about 21\n          years in that time. That 21 plus\n          my first human 20 makes me look\n          about 40.\n\n                         DARREN\n          But altogether you're 211 plus 20.\n          You're really 231 years old.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Exactly. You're going to be a\n          teenager for a very long time.\n          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Where do you keep your car anyhow?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          What car?\n\n                         DARREN\n          The one you were driving around my\n          town in.

PARKING LOT - NIGHT\n\n          The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her\n          remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the\n          seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.\n\n                         WOMAN\n          Yes?\n          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back\n          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she\n          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         DARREN & CREPSLEY\n          Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right\n          toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must\n          be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.\n          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.\n          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,\n          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...\n\n                         DARREN\n          Go. Run.\n          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his\n          hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she\n          passes out. Darren is horrified.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Did you kill her?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I put her to sleep. She'll be like\n          this 15 minutes.

One who drinks\n          only when he must can end up\n          feeding wildly.\n          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          The hunger inside us must be fed to\n          be controlled.

Crepsley takes a\n          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Your turn.\n\n                         DARREN\n          No. I won't.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Darren...\n\n                         DARREN\n          I'll never do it.\n          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          You can lead a vampire to blood,\n          but you can't make him drink.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I'm only half-vampire.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          62.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          No matter, you need blood to live\n          now. You'll drink eventually.\n          When you're hungry enough.\n          The wrist is clean, the cut gone.

You may abstain\n          tonight, but you must feed soon.\n          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks\n          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.\n\n                         DARREN\n          What is it?\n          As the woman starts to stir...\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Nothing.

The owner used\n          to beat me and keep me in a glass\n          cage. I felt like a useless freak.\n          One night I looked out of my cage\n          and saw Mr. Tall just standing\n          there. He watched me until the\n          owner came over and asked if he\n          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed\n          him by the throat and strangled him\n          to death. Then he opened the cage\n          and said, \"Let's go, Evra.\" He\n          named me that. I added the Von.\n          I've been with him ever since.\n          Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.\n\n                         CREPSLEY'S VOICE\n          Darren...\n          Darren turns.

Looking appropriate in his burial suit,\n          he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.\n\n                         DEBBIE & SAM\n          As she realizes it's Darren.

Crepsley opens the cage. Madam Octa\n          steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.\n          Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she\n          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to\n          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances\n          across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.\n          Darren looks out, sees how much Debbie enjoys it.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT.

We follow the sparks DOWN to...\n\n                         A BONFIRE\n          Blazing in the Cirque campgrounds. The freaks are eating,\n          drinking wine, relaxing after the show. Like a gypsy camp.\n          Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying\n          watching everyone else enjoy themselves.\n          Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.\n          Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And\n          he's certainly never experienced anything like this.\n          Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.\n          Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her\n          as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the\n          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a\n          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.\n          Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives\n          him a twinge or two, but only Truska notices.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          EXT. AN OLD VAN - NIGHT\n\n          A mattress on the floor inside.

One of our great leaders.\n          He may seem reluctant, but I assure\n          you, no one is as skilled at\n          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.\n          I think that's why they'd like to\n          get him out of the way. Kill him\n          off before the new war starts.\n\n                         DARREN\n          You've known him a long time?\n\n                         GAVNER PURL\n          I was his assistant.

Up\n          until now, it's the only reason he\n          ever chooses anyone.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Is it why he chose me?\n          Gavner hesitates, not sure.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          85.\n\n                         GAVNER PURL\n          That's for Crepsley to say.

Everything\n          they love is left behind until they\n          finally have nothing left to live\n          for. Except death. The fact that\n          he's taken an apprentice seems, to\n          me, a good sign.

As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren\n          reaches out and steadies her.

Finally...\n\n                         DARREN\n          We should get off this.\n          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...\n\n                         DARREN\n          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.\n\n                         DARREN'S POV\n          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.\n\n                         RAFTER\n          Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...\n          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.\n\n                         DEBBIE\n          Hold on.\n          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the\n          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.\n\n                         SAM\n          I don't think it'll hold you, dude.\n\n                         EVRA\n          Thanks for the heads up...

Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he\n          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.\n\n                         DEBBIE\n          I don't know how you hung on.

He's getting sicker.\n          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the\n          way. She smiles, waves.

To\n          avoid the end of the world.\n          As these words are pondered by Darren...\n\n          MR. TINY\n          I think I underestimated you.

Aware something's 'in the air'.\n\n                         MURLOUGH\n          Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Crepsley! Look out!\n          The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.\n          Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong.

He lands flat on his\n          back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.\n          Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG\n          KNIFE in either hand.\n          Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE\n          'switches' to life in his hand...\n\n          DARREN & MR. TINY\n          As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back\n          of the boy's neck.

His attack is brutal and blunt.\n          Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as\n          it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.\n          From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It\n          catches Murlough hard across the chops.\n\n                         OFF STAGE\n          Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.\n\n                         STAGE\n          Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in\n          Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.\n          Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade\n          dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.\n          Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over\n          heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Concentrating. Trying to flit.\n\n                         STAGE\n          Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus\n          style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so\n          brutish after all. He matches the move --\n          Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley\n          reacts, frozen in shock.\n\n          DARREN & MR. TINY\n          The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of\n          the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife\n          to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.\n          And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.\n\n          DARREN (FLIT WORLD)\n          Speeding down to the stage.

As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.\n          Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,\n          Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.\n          ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.\n\n          MR. TINY\n          Sighs. This is not how it's supposed to go.

I need blood.\n          As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...\n\n                         DARREN\n          We're going to save her together.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n          INT.

Pure animal action as he tears into\n          wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the\n          darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up\n          himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Is Crepsley dead?\n\n                         MURLOUGH\n          Who knows? Young Murlough lives,\n          but he's hurt.\n\n                         STEVE\n          What can I do?\n\n                         MURLOUGH\n          What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?\n          We need to get the blood inside\n          outside. Don't we?\n          Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:\n\n          DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA\n          He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off\n          him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams\n          again, the sound taking shape into words.\n\n                         DARREN\n\n          FORGIVE ME!!!\n\n          FACTORY STAGE SPACE\n          The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound\n          reaches them.\n\n          BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY\n          Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.\n\n                         UPPER FLOOR\n          Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Let her go.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Stop being a big shot.

He attacks.\n          Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.\n          Knocked in a heap.\n          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going\n          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's\n          pretty powerful himself.\n          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings\n          his fist in a vicious arc.\n          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right\n          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.\n          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.\n\n                         MURLOUGH\n          You need to stand still so you can\n          die.\n          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.\n          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.\n          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall\n          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with\n          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.\n\n                         FACTORY SPACE\n          The audience who remain chanting: \"Refund! Refund!\" They\n          react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.\n\n          UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY\n          Crepsley brings up his knife.\n          Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.\n          With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him\n          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We\n          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.\n          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He\n          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!\n          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at\n          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.\n          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,\n          falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking\n          Crepsley with him.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          110.\n\n                         FACTORY SPACE\n          SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in\n          mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the\n          center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.\n          As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.\n\n                         UPPER FLOOR\n          But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,\n          pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!\n          I mean it!\n          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.\n          She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.\n          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.\n          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.\n          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she\n          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.\n          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:\n          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping\n          station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.\n\n                         DARREN\n          It's over, Steve.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Is it?\n          Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling\n          but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will\n          be their last. They separate, try to gain position.\n\n                         STEVE\n          You wanna hear something funny?\n          After your funeral, I went to see\n          your parents.\n          They continue circling.\n\n                         STEVE\n          And they were fine. They acted\n          like they barely remembered you.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Liar.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n          Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the\n          head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.\n\n                         STEVE\n\n                         (SMILES)\n          And your sister. She was moving\n          into your room. They had a yard\n          sale. I bought some of your stuff.\n          Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:\n\n                         DARREN\n          Did you steal money from my mom's\n          purse?\n\n                         STEVE\n          What?\n\n                         DARREN\n          Did you?\n          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Why do you ask? Is knowing that\n          gonna help you rest in peace?\n\n                         DARREN\n          No. It's just practically the last\n          thing that ever happened between me\n          and my dad was I was arguing with\n          him.\n\n                         STEVE\n\n                         (FLIP)\n          Least you had a dad to argue with.\n          A fury building in Darren.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I was telling him he was wrong\n          about you. That's the last time we\n          had together. Fighting about you.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Hate to tell ya. Your dad was\n          right. How do you think we got the\n          money for the dumb tickets? I took\n          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.\n          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs\n          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,\n          no matter how many times Steve hits him.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          112.\n          WHAM! Darren lets Steve have it.\n\n                         DARREN\n          I miss him.\n\n          WHAM!\n\n                         DARREN\n          Do you understand?\n\n          WHAM!\n\n                         DARREN\n          I miss him so much.\n          WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.\n          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...\n          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he\n          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will\n          fall into the spikes below.\n          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you\n          won't have to do it later.\n          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.\n\n                         DARREN\n\n                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)\n          No. He used to be my friend.\n          Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Start running. Don't ever stop.\n          Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren\n          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.\n\n                         STEVE\n          Next time...\n          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.\n          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.\n\n                         DEBBIE\n          Sam?\n          Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          113.\n          She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Are you gonna be okay?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I just need to catch my breath.\n          For a few days. Maybe a week.\n\n                         DARREN\n          You think I made a mistake, don't\n          you?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          No. I think that you proved\n          yourself human after all.\n          Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.\n\n                         DARREN\n          Half human. What now?\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          What do you mean?\n\n                         DARREN\n          There's a war on, isn't there?\n          Crepsley shrugs.\n\n                         DARREN\n          This world is crossed by fences.\n          You have to decide which side you\n          stand on.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          Yes, yes. Black and white fences\n          crossing very gray fields.\n\n                         DARREN\n          It's not gray. I've met the bad\n          guys. They need to be stopped.\n\n                         CREPSLEY\n          I'm not sure it's my fight.\n\n                         DARREN\n          But you said it. There's no in\n          between. And the power of being\n          alone is never going to be greater\n          than the weakness. It's our fight.\n\n                         CUT TO:\n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n                         \n\n          114.\n\n          EXT.

Crepsley sets\n          Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam\n          Truska's tent silks.
