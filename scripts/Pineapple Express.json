FARMLAND - DAWN\n          \n          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       \n          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.\n          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.\n          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road\n          and through a massive field of emptiness.\n          \n          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.\n          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and\n          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of\n          the car.\n          \n          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the\n          General scans his surroundings with concern.\n          \n          TITLE CARD UP: THE PAST                                      \n          \n          Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL\n          HATCH in the ground.

General Brat and Agent Black\n          Suit exchange a concerned look.

He slowly walks toward the Private,\n          who looks at him in shock.\n          \n                                 SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)\n                           (through speakers)\n                    Private Miller?
