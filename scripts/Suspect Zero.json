Doesn't know if he\n    should jam on the brakes or drive faster.\n\n    He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE\n    snapping onto a hand.

The first is a TOP-SHEET,\n    written by hand: \"Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI\n    Resident Agency - Wichita Falls.\" No sender named.\n\n    He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 9.\n</b>\n\n    A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically\n    copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\"\n    At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read:\n\n    \"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1\", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn.\n    Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99.\"\n\n    Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was\n    sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two.\n\n    A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed\n    photo. Another \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" scrawled across the top of\n    it. And, at the bottom of the sheet:\n\n    \"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6\", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk.\n    Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00.\"\n\n    The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and\n    vitals. Faces. Facts. \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\"\n\n    He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax\n    number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud\n    grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line.\n\n    He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then\n    Charlton emerges from his office, shouting:\n\n<b>                         CHARLTON\n</b>               Mackelway!

Those\n    STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now...\n\n    POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site.\n    Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out.\n\n    Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD\n    GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.\n\n<b>                         DYLAN\n</b>               Afternoon, Rick.\n                   (Charlton nods)\n               Looks like a robbery/homicide.

Dylan hands a\n     preliminary report to Charlton.\n\n<b>                          DYLAN\n</b>                Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling\n                salesman, from Abilene.\n\n     Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The\n     hierarchy is being made clear. Very.\n\n     Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that\n     reads \"Welcome to Texas\" on one side and \"You are now leaving\n     Oklahoma\" on the other.\n\n     A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd...\n\n     Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just\n     about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.\n\n<b>                          MACKELWAY\n</b>                    (it blurts out)\n                Hey!\n\n     Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this\n     weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.\n\n<b>10   EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING                                 10\n</b>\n     The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic\n     handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in:\n\n<b>                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n</b>                What the fuck're you doing?!\n\n<b>                          JUMBO\n</b>                What's it look like, Bud?\n\n     Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the \"Stop\" button\n     himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of\n     LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 11.\n</b>\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n</b>                You guys ever heard of evidentiary\n                procedure?\n\n     No one replies.

Mackelway doesn't,\n     hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before\n     tumbling. Something about them...\n\n     He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a\n     few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks,\n     some FOOTPRINTS alongside them.\n\n     Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.\n\n<b>11   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING                                          11\n</b>\n     It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is\n     facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally.\n\n     Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some\n     gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even\n     breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious.\n\n<b>                          CHARLTON (O.S.)\n</b>                What's that?\n\n     Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window,\n     pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's\n     lap. It lies face down on the seat.\n\n     But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A\n     RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it.\n\n     Charlton begins to reach for it, when:\n\n<b>                          MACKELWAY\n</b>                    (to stop him)\n                Sir?\n\n     Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: \"Gloves.\"\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                            12.\n</b>\n\nCharlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy\nyou outrank, especially when he's right.\n\n<b>                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n</b>           Sort of a... stickler for procedure.\n\n<b>                     CHARLTON\n</b>           I imagine you would be.\n\nThat was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his\ngloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,\nlooking over the rest of this car, as:\n\n<b>                     GRANGER\n</b>               (aloud)\n           Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.\n\nGranger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo\nhas tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a\nten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.\n\nEverybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.\nJumbo shrugs.\n\n<b>                     JUMBO\n</b>           You said toss it.\n\nMackelway shakes his head. \"Shitkicker.\" Granger grabs the\ncrowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:\n\n<b>                     MACKELWAY\n</b>           Hold it a second.\n\nGranger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off\na few shots with the Minox.\n\nSomething catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He\nkneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a\nthin line on top of the paint in a single post.\n\nHe takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.\nThen he sniffs it. Pauses...\n\n<b>                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n</b>           Smells like... clove.\n\nHe looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.\n\n<b>                     DYLAN\n</b>               (re: Mackelway)\n           Where the hell'd you find this guy?\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 13.\n</b>\n\n<b>                          CHARLTON\n</b>                Field Office.

Granger opens the trunk.\n     Mackelway and the others look inside...\n\n     There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-\n     shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a\n     fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet.\n\n     Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's\n     nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body.\n\n     He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the\n     steering wheel. Gently.\n\n     ...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn\n     off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton\n     leans in, gets a look.\n\n<b>                            CHARLTON\n</b>                Christ...\n\n     Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS\n     EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed\n     into a series of dark, disjointed images:\n\n<b>12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12\n</b>\n     Seems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't\n     say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.\n\n     A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to\n     the ground. Then we look up.\n\n     Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just\n     as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are:\n\n<b>13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13\n</b>\n     We start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of\n     paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds\n     the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if\n     expecting to get some kind of pulse from it.\n\n     Here come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash,\n     Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease...\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 14.\n</b>\n\n     ...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face\n     is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is\n     total.\n\n     His pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as\n     the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain,\n     the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind...\n\n     And that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the\n     gun, Mackelway.\n\n     Then, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete.\n\n     O'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the\n     exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a\n     folder marked, \"MACKELWAY.\"\n\n<b>                                                       CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB.

O'Ryan\n     extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off.\n\n     Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck.

This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top\nsheet without even looking. But here's Page One:\n\nA photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN.

Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample\n     frame yet to be examined.\n\n     The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO,\n     with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a\n     quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc.\n\n     Mackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is\n     particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now\n     see, have also been torn off.

She knows that. Still, she\n     eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses\n     himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's...\n\n     Then there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM.\n\n     They turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS\n     WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses\n     a piece of paper up against the glass.\n\n     On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: \"MATCHES\n     ONE OF ONE.\" Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash-\n     through-it.\n\n     This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points\n     further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at\n     first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street\n     map.\n\n     The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those\n     scrawled lines take us to \"The Hope House,\" in Oklahoma City.\n     At the bottom a scribbled name, \"David Dyson,\" and a contact\n     number.\n\n     Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a\n     break...\n\n<b>                                                        CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>23   INT.

The rest of Boulder Elementary's student body fills\n     the seats in here, along with FACULTY MEMBERS.\n\n     Everybody's weeping.

The street is still.\n\n     Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine\n     within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the\n     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.\n\n<b>25   EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING                       25\n</b>\n     The front door is open.

He grabs the box.\n\n     Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color\n     O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK\n     PAINT here. And some used brushes.\n\n     Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look\n     INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson.\n\n     Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a\n     yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE.\n     Mackelway grabs it, eyes it.\n\n     He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with\n     eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc.\n\n     Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials\n     in this box, he spots a large folded MAP.\n\n     He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been\n     written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED.\n\n     But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots\n     something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker:\n\n     A photograph of himself.\n\n     It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But\n     there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway.\n\n     It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year,\n     concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7\n     on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List...\n\n     Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway.\n\n     Mackelway stares.

Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps\n     her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of\n     savagery fill the night.\n\n     Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful\n     silence... and the assault is over.\n\n     Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with\n     the knife will be coming after her next.\n\n     But then she hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away.

But he can't say\nfor sure just yet what it is...\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                         43.\n</b>\n\nThat wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it\nwas a red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.\n\n<b>                        MACKELWAY\n</b>           I'm sorry?\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN\n</b>           A shark, as we know, will only attack\n           humans if he runs out of food. But\n           biologists have theorized that for a\n           shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an\n           endless buffet. He'd never run out of\n           food, so he'd have no need to come to the\n           surface. Consequently, we would never see\n           him. Do you follow?\n               (Mackelway doesn't)\n           We'll never see one. But that doesn't\n           mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect\n           Zero.\n\nMackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient\nweapons... Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his\nsidearm, as O'Ryan continues:\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           Some of my colleagues think I'm\n           fascinated with evil. I think the truth\n           is just the opposite: evil is fascinated\n           with us. What better vehicle could there\n           be for creating havoc in the world - what\n           better instrument - than Man? We're vain,\n           we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have\n           an imagination that is limitless in its\n           perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying\n           to harness us. Wouldn't you?\n\nThe more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting\nthat gun...\n\nThen, disturbing the silence, a KNOCK at the door.\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           Excuse me.\n\nO'Ryan rises, goes to the door... as Mackelway unholsters his\ngun. O'Ryan opens the door. Standing here is a COED, with a\nbackpack. She looks confused.\n\n<b>                     COED\n</b>           Oh. I'm sorry.

Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as\n     time allows, then blows out of the room...\n\n<b>60   INT. BUILDING - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                   60\n</b>\n     O'Ryan turns a corner, vanishing. Mackelway follows.\n\n<b>61   INT. BUILDING - CORRIDOR CORNER - CONTINUING                     61\n</b>\n     Mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor: One\n     door after another, for what seems like a mile. But no O'Ryan.\n     Then Mackelway spots an EXIT SIGN. A stairwell...\n\n<b>62   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING                                      62\n</b>\n     Mackelway enters. The stairs go six stories UP from here...\n     and one story DOWN. A sub-basement.\n\n     It's a guess. He descends, gun drawn.\n\n<b>63   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING                                   63\n</b>\n     Mackelway emerges. \"B-2\" looks a lot like B-1: long and\n     endless. We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water,\n     the wheezing of an old generator...\n\n     And, on all sides of us, DOOES, a mile of them: maintenance\n     offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens one - a janitor's\n     supply. No one in here.\n\n     Tries another door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked.\n     Air sucks through a corridor around us. He thinks he hears\n     footsteps around a corner. Runs at them.\n\n<b>64   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING                          64\n</b>\n     Nothing. No one. Just another vast corridor. More doors.\n\n     Then, a sound. GLASS, shattering on the floor. He runs down\n     the corridor, passing a long metal CAGE that houses this\n     building's FIVE FURNACES. They're old and wheezy.\n\n     It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide.\n\n     Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted\n     glass. A sign on it reads \"Neuropsychiatric Lab.\" That's where\n     the sound came from... he thinks.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 45.\n</b>\n\n<b>65   INT.

He throws on every light\n     switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the\n     shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER.\n\n     So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work-\n     stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it.\n     Lining the walls are wide CABINETS.\n\n     But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of\n     BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the \"stacks\" -\n     perfect for hiding behind.\n\n     He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row\n     #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out...\n\n     He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching,\n     nudging open cabinets. One has been opened:\n\n     Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been\n     unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it...\n\n     In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's\n     tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it.\n     Kneels down, looking into darkness...\n\n     Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open...\n     And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck.\n\n<b>66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66\n</b>\n     Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside\n     him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage\n     has been left ajar...\n\n<b>67   INT. \"FURNACE ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                  67\n</b>\n     Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by\n     steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn.\n\n     He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the\n     humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath\n     us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1...\n\n     ...and is assaulted, from above.\n\n     O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp\n     CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's\n     gun skids across the floor.\n\n     And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                46.\n</b>\n\n     He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head\n     is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting\n     fuzzy.\n\n     We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own\n     BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of\n     that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE?\n\n     O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control.\n\n     Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of\n     FOOTSTEPS. And we hear:\n\n<b>                          MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                Hey! You! What're you doing down here!\n\n     We turn, groggily.

Above\n     him are fluorescent lights. Monitors blink...\n\n     Fran is here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries to sit up.

He likes her, despite\n      himself.\n\n      Then a MAN passes by him, a trucker. Let's call him VIC.\n\n      All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm: a cobra.\n      Keys jingle on his belt-hook. He wears a sleeveless down vest\n      and a \"God Bless America\" cap.\n\n      Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us.\n\n      Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk,\n      the attitude. Something.\n\n      So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic\n      crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast.\n      Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched.\n\n      Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to\n      distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee.\n      Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again.\n\n      And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig...\n\n      But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his\n      car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly...\n      all of this visible through the windshield.\n\n      Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit...\n\n      Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like\n      he's saying \"Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!\" He might be\n      little Charlie - we can't tell from here.\n\n      But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: \"Shut up!\"\n\n      And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling\n      dairy products.\n\n      On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as\n      coincidence. He might not be so vigilant.\n\n      This isn't a normal day. He races for the door.\n\n<b>169   EXT.

But there are three cars between them -\n      Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate.\n\n      Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between\n      them.\n\n      Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to\n      it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail.\n\n      He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from\n      ten states.\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)\n</b>                 This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a\n                 plate.

A\n      few pick-ups.\n\n      There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel,\n      and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must\n      be a thousand people in attendance today.\n\n      Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching:\n\n      Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year-\n      old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still\n      screaming and flailing.\n\n      Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, \"Behave or\n      else.\" Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                  94.\n</b>\n\n<b>172   EXT.

We CROSS\n<b>      THE LOT WITH HIM.\n</b>\n      He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's\n      the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We\n      still can't tell if it's Charlie.)\n\n      Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of\n      course. And he can't shoot his way in.\n\n      He looks to the kid inside:\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY\n</b>                 You okay?\n                     (Kid's a blank)\n                 Kid? You okay in there?\n\n      The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit...\n      Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still\n      visible to us, but he won't be for long.\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n</b>                     (at the Kid)\n                 I'll be back.

Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that\n      Vic on the other side of it?\n\n      Mackelway takes off.\n\n<b>174   EXT.

But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back\n      in the direction of the parking lot.\n\n      He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn\n      machine, past those ladies selling tickets.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 95.\n</b>\n\n<b>175   EXT.

But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away.\n\n      Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A\n      second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to\n      face with O'Ryan.\n\n      And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused.\n\n<b>                           O'RYAN\n</b>                 Well, well...

Turns\n      out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door,\n      unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.\n\n<b>                           FIVE YEAR-OLD\n</b>                 Mommy!\n\n      The kid dives into the Woman's arms.\n\n<b>                           WOMAN\n</b>                 Morning, Baby!\n\n<b>                           VIC\n</b>                 I told you she'd be here.\n                     (to Woman)\n                 He's been a brat all morning.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                  96.\n</b>\n\n      Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread\n      things, badly.\n\n      And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY\n</b>                     (at O'Ryan)\n                 Hands up.\n\n      O'Ryan raises his hands.

I put this\n           mirror here because I don't want you to\n           miss it. Are you afraid?\n\nWith that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is\nRED-HOT.

Only this time we see it through\n      Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the\n      wet wind - familiar images to us.

But as we approach them, they\n      seem to get farther away.

Then looks to see who he's just shot.\n\n      A body. He turns it over.\n\n      ...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the\n      mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror,\n      giving way as we...\n\n<b>181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181\n</b>\n      ...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a\n      pad.

His FOREHEAD has a bright red\n      raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror.\n\n      But the brain is functioning. It starts running through a\n      check-list:\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           104.\n</b>\n\nI'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive.

Maybe I am dead.\n\nMackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort.\nEverything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it.\nFlexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it.\n\nThen he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped\naround it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks\nas though a nurse had tended to it.\n\nBut this sure as hell isn't a hospital...\n\nThen, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without\nmeaning to.\n\nBut O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed\nmalevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN\n</b>               (softly)\n           Stand up.\n\nMackelway pauses, rewinding that one.\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           It's over now.

Even unbound, Mackelway is\nexpecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a\npiece of paper onto Mackelway's lap.\n\nIt's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the\nbackground. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still\ntoo unwound to speak...\n\n<b>                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n</b>           This is where he'll be. With the boy.\n               (a beat)\n           Zero.

Stand up.\n\nMackelway eyes him - utter disbelief.\n\nO'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of\nBasic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can\nwe shake on it?\n\nInstead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:\n\nIt is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an\nanimal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back.\n\nThen Mackelway is upon him.\n\nAll the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching\nhimself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable\nsobbing... they ERUPT now into violence.\n\nIt is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it\noff. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand\ncomes down like a sledgehammer.\n\nOne blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are\nsavage, barely human. He's out of control.\n\nO'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around\nthis fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here.\nHe's going to squeeze the life from him.\n\nThis is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild,\nhateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out\nof O'Ryan's throat.\n\nThen Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than\na second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own\ntwisted image.\n\nHe looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined\nto kill this guy.\n\n...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again.\n\n...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An\nanimal.\n\nHis hands, without warning, release their grip.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 106.\n</b>\n\n      O'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway\n      rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest.\n      That makes breathing a little easier.\n\n      Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM.\n\n<b>183   INT.

Initiating him\n      with that red-hot knife.\n\n      Mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes\n      some water on his face, his mind still reeling.\n\n      Then O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell -\n      face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat...\n\n      Mackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that\n      DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it.\n\n      Then O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the\n      drawing, without a word.\n\n      Mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at\n      O'Ryan's face, just inches away.\n\n      We're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage.\n\n      But O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In\n      fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then:\n\n<b>                           O'RYAN\n</b>                     (re: gun)\n                 Soon. I promise... But not yet.\n\n      He eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then\n      O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the\n      front door.\n\n      Mackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just\n      shoot this fucker in the back.\n\n      Then those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere:\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 107.\n</b>\n\n<b>184   EXT.

That is, we've seen it in\n      O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A\n      ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard.\n\n      O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind\n      blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift\n      briefly to the drawing.\n\n<b>                           MACKELWAY\n</b>                 Can't bring you in with me.

Mackelway\n      reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan\n      to club the guy.\n\n      But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them.

He walks around the side of the house.\n\n<b>190   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 190\n</b>\n      O'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes.

But now he\n      can see inside the Living Room of this home:\n\n      It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old\n      radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames.\n\n      And an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player.\n\n      Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm\n      is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an\n      old tv in here: \"Wizard of Oz\" is on it.\n\n      The lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND.\n      Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches\n      her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen.\n\n      He moves to another window.\n\n<b>192   INT.

Delia crosses to it, grabs a\n      towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              111.\n</b>\n\n      She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a\n      lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's\n      frosting tube.\n\n      She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins\n      to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly.\n\n      Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The\n      first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: \"Happy Bir...\" It's\n      a work in progress.\n\n<b>194   INT.

Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what\n      O'Ryan's doing with that lighter.\n\n      O'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly.

A monstrous, rolling beast. And\n      Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him,\n      Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.\n\n      But that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the\n      sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking-\n      up on the wet road.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 112.\n</b>\n\n      Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man\n      of 35...

It bangs, passenger\n      side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window.\n\n      Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig\n      pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.\n\n<b>198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198\n</b>\n      Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to\n      the Interstate.

He just saw something that\n      made his jaw drop:\n\n      On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT.\n\n      Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed.\n      Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen\n      it before.\n\n      And so has O'Ryan...\n\n      Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past\n      them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he\n      forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid...\n\n      Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows\n      that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with\n      O'Ryan.\n\n      And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. \"Please...\"\n\n      O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig.\n      Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time.\n      That shreds their front tire.\n\n      ...which means that in one minute this car is going to be\n      undriveable.

Then:\n\n      He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he\n      jams on the brakes.\n\n      Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a\n      vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab,\n      swatting the Yukon away like a fly.\n\n      We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look\n      like tinker toys.\n\n      The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal\n      hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS.\n\n      The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road,\n      upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out\n      the busted windshield.\n\n      What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig\n      is lying flat on its side.\n\n      And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field...\n\n<b>199   EXT.

O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now\n      opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.\n\n      Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his\n      hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat\n      field - vanishing.\n\n      Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door\n      is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels\n      across the street.\n\n      Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                 115.\n</b>\n\n<b>                            MACKELWAY\n</b>                      (over his shoulder, running)\n                 Get the van open!
