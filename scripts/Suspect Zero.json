We can't tell if this\n    is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything -\n    noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars.\n\n    Then we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually\n    just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an\n    Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now...\n\n    ...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES.\n\n1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1\n\n    Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its\n    back. The carton asks \"Have You Seen Me?\" above a photographed\n    face that's been obscured by grime.\n\n    Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in\n    that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through\n    it all. We stay with the carton...\n\n    Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows\n    in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts\n    off and whips past us.\n\n    ...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the\n    corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.\n\n    Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The\n    milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.\n\n    A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes\n    away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. \"Have\n    You Seen Me?\" It's heartbreaking.\n    TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35:\n    concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to\n    black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie.\n\n    A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n    ...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.\n\n                                                                 2.\n\n\n2   INT. \"THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER\" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2\n    (4:30 A.M.)\n\n    HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man.\n    Reads \"Rod and Reel\" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his\n    side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight:\n\n    Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a \"Drink Bud!\"\n    mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO...\n\n                         DOLLY (O.S.)\n               Top that off for ya, Hon?\n\n    That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck\n    looks up, smiles thinly, \"No.\" Dolly heads off. Speck returns\n    to his article, underlining a particular passage.\n\n    ...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite\n    Speck's. Speck reacts, startled.\n\n                          SPECK\n               Jesus...\n\n    The MAN's name is O'RYAN.

Speck pauses.\n\n                     SPECK\n           What?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           She must get lonely, with you gone all\n           the time.

On it\nis a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see\nit in rich detail. And his eyes go wide.\n\nWe catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like\na rendering of a young, naked WOMAN.\n\nAnd, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Did it myself. It's sort of a hobby.\n               (no reply)\n           I've got more. Would you like to see\n           them?\n\nO'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is\nspeechless, transfixed. Can't look away.\n\n                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Tell me: those jokes about the traveling\n           salesman and the farmer's daughter - are\n           they true?\n                      (MORE)\n\n                                                            4.\n\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (Speck remains silent)\n           Here. This one's my favorite.\n\nO'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it.\nAnd we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face.\n\nBut we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact\nhe recoils so violently that his coffee spills.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Really says it all, wouldn't you agree?\n\n                     SPECK\n           You're a... You're sick.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           That's a matter of opinion.\n\n                     SPECK\n           You're sick!\n\nHe rises, leaving the drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM as he\ncrosses the diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches the Manager,\n(MEL, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.\n\n                      MEL\n           Mmm-hmm?\n\n                     SPECK\n           I'm having a problem - with another\n           customer. I'd like you to ask him to\n           leave, please.\n\n                     MEL\n           What kind of problem?\n\n                      SPECK\n           He's--\n\nHe turns, to point out O'Ryan.\n\n...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply\ndisappeared, taking those drawings with him.\n\nSpeck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n                                                                 5.\n\n\n3   EXT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER             3\n\n    Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder\n    repeatedly. Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys. They fall\n    to the asphalt. He grabs them, opens the door.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n4   INT. SPECK'S CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER                        4\n\n    Speck guns the Buick. Interstate 35 flies by. The farther he\n    gets away from that Diner, the happier he'll be.\n\n    ...until a strange SOUND gets his attention: it's WIND, as if\n    whistling through a ghost town. Hollow, varied - building then\n    falling off again. Wind.\n\n    Trouble is, the windows in this Buick are up.\n\n    Yet there it is again: a thin, hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND,\n    whistling over his shoulder. He's heard it before - in every\n    Western he ever watched as a kid.\n\n    But this wind is coming from his back-seat.\n\n    The blood drains right out of Speck's face. Doesn't know if he\n    should jam on the brakes or drive faster.\n\n    He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE\n    snapping onto a hand. Dear God: O'Ryan is back there, making\n    that odd Ghost-Town wind sound. Whistling.\n\n                          SPECK\n                    (sheer terror)\n               What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-\n               me?!\n\n    No reply. Instead, another gift appears from the back: a\n    FOURTH DRAWING, tossed from the darkness into Speck's lap.\n\n    He looks down, registers the image... and SHRIEKS.\n\n                         O'RYAN (O.S.)\n               There's a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull\n               into it.\n\n                         SPECK\n               I have some money. It's not a lot but--\n\n                         O'RYAN\n               Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just\n               pull in.\n\n                                                                 6.\n\n\n                         SPECK\n               Why?!\n\n    O'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu...\n\n                         O'RYAN\n               Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles\n               an hour. It could be dangerous.\n\n    Speck finds the off-ramp. His breaths are shallow now.\n\n                         SPECK\n               Please, Mister - what do you want from\n               me?\n\n    O'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n    ...the face of VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, on a bulletin board.\n\n5   INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME       5\n    DAY)\n\n    We're looking at the F.B.I.'s \"Ten Most-Wanted List.\" Starkey\n    is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape,\n    murder, kidnapping.\n\n    THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes...\n\n    Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact,\n    a whiz at everything he's ever attempted.\n\n    So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas...?\n\n    EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet\n    phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig.\n\n                         CHARLTON (O.S.)\n               Got a spot set up for you, Tom.\n\n    That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly.\n    Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows.\n\n                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n               Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the\n               desk. She puts a package together for all\n               the new agents, things to know about the\n               area, help with finding apartments and\n               such. This one's yours:\n\n    Charlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A\n    corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread.\n\n                                                                 7.\n\n\n\n                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n               Not so different from Dallas, is it?\n\n                         MACKELWAY\n                   (fuck yes)\n               No, Sir.\n\n                         CHARLTON\n               Good.\n\n    An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so\n    we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a\n    briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world:\n\n    A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15,\n    on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer,\n    calendar, a baseball covered with autographs.\n\n    He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of\n    BUFFERIN into the back of it.\n\n    ...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles,\n    and throws them down his throat, as:\n\n                         GRIEVES (O.S.)\n               Ya like Frito Pies?\n\n    Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white\n    grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not\n    quite as ambitious. But solid, decent.\n\n                         MACKELWAY\n               I dunno. What are they?\n\n    Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a\n    semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway:\n\n                         GRIEVES\n               Welcome to the minors.\n\n    Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a\n    few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie.\n    God, get me outta here...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6\n\n    A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE\n    OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on\n    assignment. Men in motion.\n\n                                                                 8.\n\n\n    But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report.\n    It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word\n    \"beige\" and replacing it with \"tan.\"\n\n    His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him.\n    But after lingering for a half-second on that \"Most-Wanted\n    List\" again? Starkey? It's a wound...\n\n7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7\n\n    Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to\n    him. Filter, water, grounds, etc.\n\n                         KATIE (O.S.)\n               Here. Lemme do that.\n\n    He turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under-\n    challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds\n    she's got the thing percolating. Of course.\n\n                         KATIE (CONT'D)\n               It takes some experience.\n\n    He shrugs, not feeling too smooth.\n\n                         KATIE (CONT'D)\n               You're Mackelway, right?\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n               Mmm-hmm.\n\n                         KATIE\n               Fax came in for you. It's the room next\n               door.\n\n                         MACKELWAY\n               Oh. Thanks.\n\n    He rises, heads for the \"fax room\"...\n\n8   INT. \"FAX ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                      8\n\n    A former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX\n    MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax\n    machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it.\n\n    Six pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET,\n    written by hand: \"Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI\n    Resident Agency - Wichita Falls.\" No sender named.\n\n    He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax.\n\n                                                                 9.\n\n\n    A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically\n    copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\"\n    At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read:\n\n    \"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1\", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn.\n    Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99.\"\n\n    Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was\n    sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two.\n\n    A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed\n    photo. Another \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\" scrawled across the top of\n    it. And, at the bottom of the sheet:\n\n    \"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6\", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk.\n    Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00.\"\n\n    The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and\n    vitals. Faces. Facts. \"HAVE YOU SEEN ME?\"\n\n    He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax\n    number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud\n    grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line.\n\n    He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then\n    Charlton emerges from his office, shouting:\n\n                         CHARLTON\n               Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all\n               day, or do you wanna do something?\n\n    Mackelway's out of this room in an instant.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9\n\n    Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds\n    poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those\n    STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now...\n\n    POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site.\n    Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out.\n\n    Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD\n    GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.\n\n                         DYLAN\n               Afternoon, Rick.\n                   (Charlton nods)\n               Looks like a robbery/homicide. Body's\n               over that way.\n\n                                                                 10.\n\n\n     He gestures toward a ravine, where a TOW TRUCK is currently\n     lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle.\n\n     It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering\n     on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Ya run the plates?\n\n     Charlton eyes Mackelway: \"Easy, Hot-shot.\" Mackelway nods,\n     reminding himself to remember his new rank. Dylan hands a\n     preliminary report to Charlton.\n\n                          DYLAN\n                Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling\n                salesman, from Abilene.\n\n     Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The\n     hierarchy is being made clear. Very.\n\n     Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that\n     reads \"Welcome to Texas\" on one side and \"You are now leaving\n     Oklahoma\" on the other.\n\n     A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd...\n\n     Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just\n     about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (it blurts out)\n                Hey!\n\n     Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this\n     weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.\n\n10   EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING                                 10\n\n     The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic\n     handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in:\n\n                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                What the fuck're you doing?!\n\n                          JUMBO\n                What's it look like, Bud?\n\n     Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the \"Stop\" button\n     himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of\n     LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching.\n\n                                                                 11.\n\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                You guys ever heard of evidentiary\n                procedure?\n\n     No one replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens,\n     expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds.\n\n                          MACKWELWAY (CONT'D)\n                Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.\n\n     Charlton eyes the car. Then Mackelway.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway.\n                Let's have a look.\n\n     Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't,\n     hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before\n     tumbling. Something about them...\n\n     He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a\n     few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks,\n     some FOOTPRINTS alongside them.\n\n     Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.\n\n11   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING                                          11\n\n     It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is\n     facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally.\n\n     Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some\n     gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even\n     breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious.\n\n                          CHARLTON (O.S.)\n                What's that?\n\n     Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window,\n     pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's\n     lap. It lies face down on the seat.\n\n     But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A\n     RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it.\n\n     Charlton begins to reach for it, when:\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (to stop him)\n                Sir?\n\n     Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: \"Gloves.\"\n\n                                                            12.\n\n\nCharlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy\nyou outrank, especially when he's right.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Sort of a... stickler for procedure.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           I imagine you would be.\n\nThat was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his\ngloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,\nlooking over the rest of this car, as:\n\n                     GRANGER\n               (aloud)\n           Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.\n\nGranger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo\nhas tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a\nten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.\n\nEverybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.\nJumbo shrugs.\n\n                     JUMBO\n           You said toss it.\n\nMackelway shakes his head. \"Shitkicker.\" Granger grabs the\ncrowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Hold it a second.\n\nGranger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off\na few shots with the Minox.\n\nSomething catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He\nkneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a\nthin line on top of the paint in a single post.\n\nHe takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.\nThen he sniffs it. Pauses...\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Smells like... clove.\n\nHe looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.\n\n                     DYLAN\n               (re: Mackelway)\n           Where the hell'd you find this guy?\n\n                                                                 13.\n\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Field Office. Dallas.\n\n                          DYLAN\n                    (impressed)\n                Well now...\n                    (Charlton shrugs)\n                So what the hell's he doin' here?\n\n     That one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk.\n     Mackelway and the others look inside...\n\n     There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-\n     shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a\n     fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet.\n\n     Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's\n     nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body.\n\n     He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the\n     steering wheel. Gently.\n\n     ...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn\n     off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton\n     leans in, gets a look.\n\n                            CHARLTON\n                Christ...\n\n     Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS\n     EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed\n     into a series of dark, disjointed images:\n\n12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12\n\n     Seems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't\n     say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.\n\n     A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to\n     the ground. Then we look up.\n\n     Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just\n     as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are:\n\n13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13\n\n     We start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of\n     paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds\n     the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if\n     expecting to get some kind of pulse from it.\n\n     Here come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash,\n     Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease...\n\n                                                                 14.\n\n\n     ...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face\n     is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is\n     total.\n\n     His pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as\n     the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain,\n     the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind...\n\n     And that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the\n     gun, Mackelway.\n\n     Then, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete.\n\n     O'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the\n     exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a\n     folder marked, \"MACKELWAY.\"\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY                   14\n\n     Picket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing.\n     A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to\n     cry into.\n\n15   INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)             15\n\n     Shocked faces. Food on unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN,\n     40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. FRIENDS and FAMILY\n     mill about, tending to her.\n\n     KIDS hover. Two of them, a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD\n     GIRL, sniff back tears as people offer condolences.\n\n     But the focus here is Jan - her grief. She's shaking...\n\n                          O'RYAN (O.S.)\n                Mrs. Speck?\n\n     She looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty\n     faces in here. Jan half-nods.\n\n                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                Just wanted to offer my condolences.\n                    (takes her hand)\n                I didn't know him well but... I think\n                Harold was a much more complex man than\n                people realized.\n\n     Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now.\n\n                                                                  15.\n\n\n                          JAN\n                    (through tears)\n                He was, wasn't he?\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.\n\n     She sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan\n     extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off.\n\n     Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and\n     into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the\n     portrait's FRAME, and:\n\n     BAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again:\n\n16   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                                  16\n\n     This time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear\n     that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were\n     running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to\n     be saying:\n\n                            (O.S.)\n                Please...\n\n     The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite\n     somewhere, or a distance of time and space.\n\n     Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just\n     ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway...\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n17   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17\n\n     Mackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked\n     between two big-rigs in the lot of the \"All-American Diner.\"\n     Sky looks black tonight. It rumbles...\n\n     And that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... It was all\n     his.\n\n     He pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket.\n     Slugs them down. This headache is a constant. Then he gets out\n     of the Yukon...\n\n18   INT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING                   18\n\n     Mackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite\n     a WOMAN, her back to us.\n\n                                                               16.\n\n\n19   INT. BOOTH - CONTINUING                                         19\n\n     Mackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn.\n\n                           CHARLTON\n                Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce\n                you, but I understand that won't be\n                necessary.\n\n     Mackelway doesn't get it... until the WOMAN turns. She is\n     AGENT FRAN KULOK. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to\n     be. But with a guard that never comes down.\n\n     Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react.\n     It takes some effort.\n\n                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                Seems your former office has decided we\n                might need some help on this one. So they\n                sent out Agent Kulok.\n\n                          FRAN\n                Tom.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Fran.\n\n     That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                I guess we're skipping the tearful\n                reunion. Have a seat, Tom.\n\n     Mackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds her hands.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                How's things back at the ranch?\n\n                          FRAN\n                Movin' right along.\n\n     That might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Okay. Whadda we know?\n\n                          FRAN\n                Picked up a foot-print in the back seat\n                of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger\n                than Speck's.\n\n     Just like that, Fran is piping up. Mackelway's unoffended.\n\n                                                         17.\n\n\n                       CHARLTON\n           'Kay.\n\n                     FRAN\n           Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he\n           was strangled from behind... I think our\n           guy waited for him in the backseat,\n           sprung this on him once the car was\n           moving.\n\nShe slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our\nfirst look at it.\n\nINSERT - THE DRAWING:\n\n...a STEAMER-TRUNK, lined with plastic. Inside it are large\nZIPLOC BAGS. Inside the bags are BODY PARTS.\n\nIt's realized so accurately that it looks more like a\nphotograph. No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply.\n\nTHE BOOTH - RESUMING\n\nCharlton eyes it without reaction.\n\n                     FRAN (CONT'D)\n           Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges\n           of the paper, consistent with powdered\n           gloves.\n               (Charlton nods)\n           So he gets the dropped in his lap, it\n           spooks him, and the car winds up in the\n           ravine.\n\nPlausible enough, until:\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           I don't think so, no. I think it was\n           pushed.\n\n                     FRAN\n           How ya figure?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near\n           the embankment.\n\nWithout embellishing any further, he slides over the\nPHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox: tire-\ntracks, foot-prints. She eyes them.\n\nThen she eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes the tension.\n\n                                                           18.\n\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures\n           of body parts and then spring 'em on\n           people. What's that get us?\n               (they're silent)\n           That's what I thought.\n\nThere is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran.\nCharlton has no time for it.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came in for you:\n\nHe tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway, who opens it. Six\nsheets of paper slide out.\n\nFirst one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written\ninscription as the last one: \"Attention, Agent Thomas\nMackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls.\"\n\nOkay. This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top\nsheet without even looking. But here's Page One:\n\nA photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN.

They come to a stop at that Bonneville,\n     stripped down to its primer. Time to work...\n\n     Two agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details,\n     their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox,\n     snaps off a few more shots. Then:\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Trunk's ajar.\n\n     She turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar.\n     Mackelway approaches, cautiously.\n\n     He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to\n     protect against prints. He opens the trunk.\n\n     First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a-\n     slash-through-it... staring right at him.\n\n                                                                 21.\n\n\n     But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.\n\n     Mackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body,\n     stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead.\n\n     Mackelway sighs.

Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample\n     frame yet to be examined.\n\n     The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO,\n     with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a\n     quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc.\n\n     Mackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is\n     particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now\n     see, have also been torn off. Hmmmm...\n\n                          FRAN\n                Why eyelids?\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Huh?\n\n                          FRAN\n                No other signs of torture here.

So:\n\n                                                                  22.\n\n\n                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                    (to Fran, quietly)\n                I'm sorry about Don.\n\n                          FRAN\n                    (thrown)\n                Huh?\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                You're not wearing your ring anymore.\n\n     That was an attempt at kindness. She knows that. Still, she\n     eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses\n     himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's...\n\n     Then there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM.\n\n     They turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS\n     WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses\n     a piece of paper up against the glass.\n\n     On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: \"MATCHES\n     ONE OF ONE.\" Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash-\n     through-it.\n\n     This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points\n     further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at\n     first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street\n     map.\n\n     The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those\n     scrawled lines take us to \"The Hope House,\" in Oklahoma City.\n     At the bottom a scribbled name, \"David Dyson,\" and a contact\n     number.\n\n     Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a\n     break...\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n23   INT.

The rest of Boulder Elementary's student body fills\n     the seats in here, along with FACULTY MEMBERS.\n\n     Everybody's weeping. A framed picture of Barney Fulcher sits\n     on a stand, with candles around it:\n\n                          SINGING FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS\n                A-may-zing Grace, How sweet the sound--\n\n                                                                 23.\n\n\n     In the back, some of the TOWNSFOLK have gathered for this\n     assembly, touched. O'Ryan stands among them. No expression on\n     his face at all...\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n24   EXT. \"HOPE HOUSE\" - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT                         24\n\n     A three-story Victorian residence in decay, next door to a\n     CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma City's Skid Row.\n     Rain falls. The street is still.\n\n     Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine\n     within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the\n     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.\n\n25   EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING                       25\n\n     The front door is open. Through a SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway can\n     see an old-fashioned \"foyer.\" He knocks. Waits.\n\n     Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident\n     singing, which we realize is an a capela version of \"La Vida\n     Loca\" audible through an open bedroom window.\n\n     But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open\n     anyway... So Mackelway enters.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Hello?\n\n26   INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                              26\n\n     TV room is to his left. There, a single 35 year-old DRUNK/\n     TRANSIENT (we'll call him \"PIPER\") sits, watching \"Behind the\n     Music\" on VH1. Tonight's subject? Leif Garret...\n\n     Piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge Mackelway at all. Rather\n     he INCREASES THE TV VOLUME to drown out the singing upstairs,\n     which seems to be intentionally off-key.\n\n     Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. Posters and\n     fliers on the walls. 10 BEDROOMS upstairs.\n\n                          DYSON (O.S.)\n                Agent Mackelway?\n\n     Mackelway turns. Descending a creaking stairway is DAVID\n     DYSON: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n                                                               24.\n\n\n27   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      27\n\n     We are staring at a BASEMENT WALL that has been covered, floor\n     to ceiling, with 1,000 identical renderings of that same\n     symbol: the CIRCLE-WITH-A-SLASH-THROUGH-IT.\n\n     1,000 of them, in bright red paint, against pitch black\n     enamel. Only a machine could have achieved this kind of\n     repetition. Or a maniac.\n\n     This basement is leaky, drafty, poorly lit. But it's also\n     quiet: the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been MUTED\n     by the basement door and the rain itself.\n\n                          DYSON\n                Benjamin spent hours down here.\n\n     Mackelway takes it all in, every corner of this basement. He\n     notes a row of standing GYM LOCKERS.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (re: lockers)\n                Did he have access to those?\n\n                          DYSON\n                No. They're staff-only.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Would you mind opening them for me?\n\n     Dyson shrugs; he thinks it's a waste of time - but he'll do\n     it. Mackelway follows him across the dank room.\n\n                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                He was here... seven years you said?\n\n                          DYSON\n                Off and on. It's not uncommon for our\n                guests to vanish for months at a time.\n\n     Dyson works a combination lock on the first locker.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                I ran the name through our database, just\n                to be sure. There's never been an Agent\n                Benjamin O'Ryan in the Bureau.\n\n                          DYSON\n                No... but as elaborate fantasies go, it\n                was one of my favorites.\n                    (fondly)\n                And he always seemed so sincere about it.\n\n                                                          25.\n\n\nDyson half-chuckles; he always liked the guy... He throws open\nthe locker. Inside, nothing. Mackelway indicates the next\nlocker. Dyson works the combination.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Is that what you called him? Benjamin?\n\n                     DYSON\n           It's what he wished to be called.\n\nLocker #2 is opened - also empty. Only one locker left.\n\n                     DYSON (CONT'D)\n               (re: locker #3)\n           That one's mine.\n\nMackelway shrugs: \"Sorry, it has to be opened.\" Dyson sighs,\nthen works the combination. Mackelway waits.\n\nLocker #3 is opened. Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater,\nsome old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: \"See?\" Mackelway\nnods. Dyson shuts the locker.\n\nMackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with-\na-slash-through-it. No idea what they signify...\n\n                     DYSON (CONT'D)\n           He painted one of the walls in his room,\n           too.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Can I see it?\n\n                     DYSON\n           We've painted it over.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Still, might be helpful.\n\nDyson heads for the stairs. They're wooden slats with more\nbasement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old\nvaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture.\n\nMackelway follows. They climb...\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Wait.\n\nThey stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible\nbeneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking\nout of it...\n\n                                                                26.\n\n\n28   INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28\n\n     Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing\n     aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box.\n\n     Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color\n     O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK\n     PAINT here. And some used brushes.\n\n     Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look\n     INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson.\n\n     Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a\n     yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE.\n     Mackelway grabs it, eyes it.\n\n     He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with\n     eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc.\n\n     Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials\n     in this box, he spots a large folded MAP.\n\n     He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been\n     written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED.\n\n     But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots\n     something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker:\n\n     A photograph of himself.\n\n     It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But\n     there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway.\n\n     It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year,\n     concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7\n     on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List...\n\n     Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway.\n\n     Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS,\n     for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK.\n                                                                      29\n29   EXT.

HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30\n\n     Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist,\n     murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning\n     failure for all involved.\n\n     ...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again...\n\n31   INT. \"CLUB\" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31\n\n     Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW\n     taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into\n     some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying.\n\n     Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the\n     only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing.\n\n     Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head.\n\n     Starkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find\n     somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on.\n\n32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32\n\n     That ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's\n     case was thrown out of court. It is this:\n\n     The F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in\n     \"evidentiary procedure.\" Hence, Mackelway's picture.\n\n     On his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago.\n\n33   INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK           33\n\n     Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros. Now\n     Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent to a\n     courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him.\n\n                          PROSECUTOR #1\n                D'you understand how fucked we are?\n\n                            MACKELWAY\n                Yes, Sir.\n\n                          PROSECUTOR #1\n                Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a\n                Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me?\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                They assured me that they understood\n                protocol.\n\n                                                                 28.\n\n\n                          PROSECUTOR #1\n                Well guess what? They didn't. And this\n                prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.\n\n     That registered.\n\n34   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             34\n\n     Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all\n     concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it.\n\n     Mackelway's memory just got stoked again:\n\n35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35\n\n     Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped.\n\n     The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he\n     sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes\n     say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps.\n\n36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36\n\n     The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look\n     composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel\n     dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror.\n\n     He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his\n     own reflection.\n\n     Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns.\n\n     Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey\n     emerges, coming into view under a single light.\n\n     Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by\n     Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts\n     his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK.\n\n37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37\n\n     Mackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what\n     the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient?\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n38   INT. HOPE HOUSE - \"O'RYAN'S ROOM\" - MOMENTS LATER                 38\n\n     Mackelway leans in, looking around. A bed. A small end-table.\n     Bathroom. A window without bars.\n\n                                                               29.\n\n\n     From down the hall we hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING, then\n     a FAX transmission. An old fax machine begins to whine\n     noisily, creaking. It's a distraction.\n\n     But Mackelway's focus is in this room. The walls have been newly\n     painted. But there's a hint of barely-perceptible color\n     beneath one of them. Rain from a LEAKY ROOF is causing some of\n     the new paint to peel a bit.\n\n     A BUCKET collects drops in the center of the room. The feeling\n     in here is damp, mildewy, creepy. Mackelway remains in the\n     doorway... then backs out.\n\n                          DYSON (O.S.)\n                I guess you fellas're never unaccounted\n                for, huh?\n\n39   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUING                                       39\n\n     Mackelway turns, a bit startled. Dyson is approaching, FAX in\n     hand.\n\n                            MACKELWAY\n                Huh?\n\n     Dyson extends six pages. On the TOP-SHEET, written by hand,\n     are the words: \"Agent Thomas Mackelway, C/O Mr. David Dyson,\n     Hope House\" with a street address.\n\n     And under that top sheet? Five more pages.\n\n     Mackelway sighs, takes them from Dyson. Sure enough, he's\n     staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets. Five more\n     HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.\n\n     But how would anyone know to send them here?\n\n                          DYSON\n                Anything urgent?\n\n                            MACKELWAY\n                      (doesn't look up)\n                No.\n\n     Dyson is glad to hear it.\n\n                                                     CUT TO:\n\n40   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER                         40\n\n     Mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place.\n     Piper is where we left him, watching VH1 in the TV Room.\n\n                                                         30.\n\n\nMackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more\nHAVE YOU SEEN ME'S... He reaches the door.\n\n                        PIPER\n              Ever seen a fifty-foot shark?\n\nMackelway stops, turns.\n\n                        MACKELWAY\n              I'm sorry?\n\n                        PIPER\n              Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?\n\n                        MACKELWAY\n              No.\n\n                        PIPER\n              Doesn't mean there aren't any.\n\nGreat. Mackelway reaches for the front door again. Then he\nhalts. Maybe this guy can be helpful. Mackelway turns:\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Did you know him?\n               (Piper's silent)\n           The guy who used to stay upstairs.\n           \"O'Ryan.\" Did you know him?\n\n                     PIPER\n           Why? Is he dead?\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n           I don't...\n\n                     PIPER\n           You said \"Did.\" Is he dead?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's not dead...\n               (a beat)\n           You know him?\n\nPiper nods.\n\nMackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that\nimage: the circle-with-slash-through-it.\n\n                        MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n              He ever talk about this? A circle with a\n              slash through it?\n\n                                                                 31.\n\n\n     Piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close.\n     It's unsettling.\n\n                          PIPER\n                That's not a circle. It's a zero.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Oh. How do you know?\n\n     Piper doesn't answer. Instead he simply starts whistling.\n\n     But it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. It's that same\n     sound that O'Ryan made: A WHISTLING WIND, blowing through a\n     ghost town... Building, then falling again.\n\n     Piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it,\n     stifling a giggle...\n\n     Then, suddenly, everything turns GRAINY, CHOPPY...\n\n     We've jumped into a distorted, REMOTE POV of this same scene -\n     as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or\n     a distance of time and space...\n\n     We see images, fragments: Piper, the tv, the sofa, Mackelway's\n     face. Then all sound breaks up, and we are...\n\n41   INT. MOTEL ROOM - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                  41\n\n     Start on O'Ryan's EYES. Then a pad of paper. The spasm of a\n     pen, scrawling a LIST on to it: \"Piper. TV. Whistling.\" We're\n     in another non-descript MOTEL ROOM. $29 a night.\n\n     He holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that\n     list of words, keeping it there for a few seconds, as if\n     expecting to receive some kind of pulse from it.\n\n     No more pulse. He has lost the \"connection\" that had somehow\n     transported him. He notes his watch. Jots down the exact time.\n     Slips the pad into that FOLDER: \"Mackelway.\"\n\n     Then he starts to DRAW - a hurried but accurate sketch of\n     Mackelway and Piper, just as they stood during that\n     conversation. The geography is fairly accurate.\n\n     O'Ryan continues to draw. We CRANE OUT of this motel room, to\n     find, on the street below:\n\n42   EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                       42\n\n     A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just\n     across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel...\n\n                                                                32.\n\n\n43   INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                        43\n\n     Low-lights, dust on the floor. Pool tables.\n\n     LORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox,\n     weighing her choices. She's got a thick curtain of hair, which\n     she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP. It's a habit.\n\n     She chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar,\n     walking to the beat. It's fun being 19 and beautiful.\n\n44   AT THE BAR - CONTINUING                                          44\n\n     The BARTENDER'S a stocky guy with a broad smile.\n\n                          LORETTA\n                    (re: song)\n                How's that?\n\n                          BARTENDER\n                Little cute for my taste, but I can stand\n                three minutes of it.\n\n                          LORETTA\n                I'll have a seven and seven, please.\n\n                          BARTENDER\n                Seven and seven. Got some i.d.?\n\n     She half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and\n     throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re-\n     fastening that chip-clip. It's her best move.\n\n                          LORETTA\n                It's in the car. No one's asked me for it\n                for a couple years now.\n\n                          BARTENDER\n                If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end\n                of the song.\n\n     She eyes him: are you really carding me? He smiles: nothing\n     personal, Sugar. So she heads for the door.\n\n     ...on her way, she passes a booth. In it we find a familiar\n     face - Virgil Ray Starkey...\n\n     He remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. But behind\n     his eyes, something primal just took place. He rises, heads\n     for the door.\n\n                                                                 33.\n\n\n45   EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                          45\n\n     Loretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She\n     doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's\n     motel room...\n\n46   EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                             46\n\n     It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground\n     beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away,\n     kicking up gravel.\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n     ...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread.\n\n47   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER                            47\n\n     We're off-road. Missouri's woods can be seen through the\n     windshield. And Starkey is staring at us. Pawing at us...\n\n                          LORETTA\n                Please, Mister...\n\n     Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the\n     window, hard. That makes things start to swim. Starkey tears\n     at her clothes, lowers himself on to her.\n\n     She whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO:\n\n48   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME                                 48\n\n     This is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls\n     and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen\n     table, scuffed blinds.\n\n     ...and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night.\n\n     Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear\n     Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights are like this. His head\n     is POUNDING again. Down go four more Bufferin.\n\n     Above him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the MAP he took\n     from that Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED.\n\n     It's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror.\n\n     As we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been\n     written on, in pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it:\n     Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED, by hand, in\n     RED. Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside\n     it, also in red: (\"4/6,\" \"5/19,\" \"10-26,\" etc.)\n\n                                                                 34.\n\n\n     Mackelway studies it, his face working. Another of those\n     WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang, suspended. Mackelway\n     shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it.\n\n     He won't sleep a wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to:\n\n49   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING                                 49\n\n     The attack continues, its terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs.\n     It hurts. Starkey's too powerful to fight off. We stay on her\n     face: dazed, her mind simply checking out.\n\n     ...until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a\n     SHADOW that just passed by.\n\n     Then the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES.\n\n     Glass flies everywhere, and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up.\n     They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up,\n     his back sliced open by shards. He screams.\n\n     She can't resist coming to the window, where she sees:\n\n50   EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING                       50\n\n     Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing\n     over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long\n     HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand.\n\n     But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational:\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya\n                know where I can find a good donkey show?\n\n     Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac:\n\n                          STARKEY\n                Huh?\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America\n                animals have rights.\n                    (pointedly)\n                Don't they, Virgil?\n\n                          STARKEY\n                How the fuck should I know?\n\n     O'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head.\n     Loretta's eyes go wide. Another kick follows, to the ribs.\n     Then one to the groin. Then:\n\n                                                                 35.\n\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                    (at Loretta)\n                Turn around.\n\n     He said that without looking at her. But he can tell that she\n     hasn't moved - too frightened. So he eyes her.\n\n                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                    (again)\n                Turn around!\n\n     She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her\n     head. No idea what kind of terror is to come next. We STAY\n     WITH HER... able only to hear what follows:\n\n     The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a\n     horrible SQUEAL, covering the GRUNTS coming from O'Ryan.\n\n     In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from\n     Starkey. Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps\n     her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of\n     savagery fill the night.\n\n     Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful\n     silence... and the assault is over.\n\n     Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with\n     the knife will be coming after her next.\n\n     But then she hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away. So she rises,\n     peeking over the edge of the window. WE STAY ON HER FACE, as\n     she sees what's become of her attacker.\n\n     Her horrified SCREAM fills the woods...\n\n51   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - RESUMING                   51\n\n     Mackelway STARES out the window; seems like he just HEARD that\n     scream. Of course, that'd be impossible. He looks to that map.\n     His PHONE RINGS. He eyes it, unsurprised...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n52   EXT.

Loretta is sitting on the back\n     of an ambulance, being tended to.\n\n     A COMPOSITE ARTIST sits beside her, trying.\n\n                          LORETTA\n                I don't think the eyes are right.\n\n                                                          36.\n\n\n                       COMPOSITE ARTIST\n           Narrower?\n\n                     LORETTA\n           No, they were... I don't really know.\n\nComposite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look\nanything like the face of O'Ryan.\n\nCharlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.\n\nA Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps out of\nit. We follow him as he takes in the scene.\n\nA FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; is got a zero-with-\na-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face\nyet.\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n           Sir?\n               (Charlton turns)\n           We got an i.d. yet?\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Mmm-hmm.\n               (Mackelway waits)\n           Might wanna find yourself a fender.\n           You're gonna need to sit down.\n               (Mackelway's still waiting)\n           It's Virgil Ray Starkey.\n\nMackelway pales.\n\nWe stay on him for a moment as it registers.

No. God, no.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n               (struggling for composure:)\n           Starkey did this?\n                     CHARLTON\n           No. Starkey's the one on the ground.\n\nMackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. But he turns\ntoward the face, as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing\nthe image into the darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped\naway.\n\nMackelway stares, stunned.

FBI OFFICE - MACKELWAY'S CUBICLE - MORNING                    53\n\n     The number of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has now grown, quite a bit.\n     45 PAGES sit stacked on Mackelway's desk. 45 victims. He grabs\n     the stack, rises.\n\n     Heading for the Conference Room, he nearly bumps into Katie,\n     the Receptionist, rounding a corner.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                'Scuse me.\n\n     She smiles. He carries the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's into:\n\n54   INT. FBI OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUING                     54\n\n     A room has been dedicated solely to those three murders. On an\n     erasure board are the words: The \"O'Ryan\" Room.\n\n     On one wall is the MAP Mackelway took from Hope House: over a\n     thousand CITIES circled by O'Ryan himself.\n\n     Mackelway puts down the stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Picks up\n     a box of YELLOW STICK-PINS, affixing them to the map - one for\n     every faxed face.\n\n     Here's \"Jason Corey, Age 14.\" Last seen in \"Riverside, Ca.\" on\n     \"10-16-99.\"\n\n     Sure enough, O'Ryan had circled \"Riverside, Ca.\" on this map.\n     Next to it he'd written \"10-16.\"\n\n     Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside.\n\n     Next, the fax concerning \"Anna Casitas, Age 22.\" Last Seen?\n     \"Macon, Ga.\" on \"5-6-00.\"\n\n     Of course, O'Ryan had circled \"Macon\" too. Beside it he'd\n     written \"5-6.\" So Macon gets a yellow pin.\n\n                                                         38.\n\n\nMackelway continues, as:\n\n                     FRAN (O.S.)\n           Got nothing on the last fax.\n\nMackelway turns. In comes Fran.\n\n                     FRAN (CONT'D)\n           Came from a business center at a Mariott\n           in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it.\n\nMackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the\nroom.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Whadda we know about the map?\n\n                      MACKELWAY\n           It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost\n           perfectly.\n\nCharlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red.\nMackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE\nYOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)\n\nCharlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the\nmap: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Why's Greenville in blue?\n\n(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but\ntiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.)\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Only city where the date on the fax and\n           the date on the map didn't correspond.\n\nHe pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named \"Steven\nKim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance:\n8-7-98.\"\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Fax lists the date of disappearance as\n           August 7. On the map he's written \"10-\n           26.\"\n\nThe DATE on O'Ryan's map reads \"10-26\" beside Greenville, Tx.\nSo Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map.\n\nCharlton notes today's date: October 17...\n\n                                                                39.\n\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Any of these bodies been recovered?\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Two so far. Female, disappeared from\n                Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male,\n                Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.\n\n     On the MAP, Dayton's got \"4/12\" written beside it. Trenton has\n     \"1/5.\" Both have yellow pins in them.\n\n                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                But both bodies were found over a\n                thousand miles from where they'd last\n                been seen. One in Montana, the other in\n                Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both.\n\n     Charlton looks to the table, where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY\n     PHOTOS sit - two victims we've never seen before.\n\n     We see the VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist and\n     above, waist and below. Charlton gives the photos a cursory\n     glance, nothing more.\n\n     But we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from\n     Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf.\n\n     Looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf...\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Either of the bodies have the zero on\n                them?\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                No, Sir.\n\n     Charlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We\n     look to that MAP, a handful of yellow pins in it...\n\n                                                 DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     ...that same map, over a HUNDRED YELLOW PINS in it now.\n\n55   INT. FBI OFFICE - \"O'RYAN ROOM\" - NIGHT                          55\n\n     It's 8:30 at night. Mackelway is alone in here - staring at\n     the map. He's been doing a lot of that lately.\n\n     The stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has grown as well. Every one\n     of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map.\n\n                                                           40.\n\n\n(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We\nsee a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC,\neach stamped and addressed to Mackelway.)\n\nMackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him.\nAssorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he\ntook himself with that Minox.\n\n                      FRAN\n           Why you?\n\n                      MACKELWAY\n           Huh?\n\n                     FRAN\n           He could be sending these to any agent in\n           any office in the country... But he's\n           sending them to you. Why?\n\nMackelway's been asking himself that same question lately.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           I don't know.\n\nPHONE RINGS.

TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                     56\n\n     A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast,\n     expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The\n     place goes on forever.\n\n57   INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME                 57\n\n     Mackelway exits an elevator on the \"B-1 Level.\" Corridors\n     octopus their way from these elevators, confusing us...\n\n58   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                            58\n\n     Every door looks the same. Mackelway follows the numbers -\n     can't believe how long these hallways are. Turns a corner.\n\n     Air can be heard, moving through the corridor. But he has\n     found the right number, at last.\n\n     A tiny CARD fastened to a wall reads, \"Dr. Emile Daitz,\n     Professor Emeritus, Criminal Psychology.\" It also lists his\n     office hours. Mackelway knocks at a door.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Professor Daitz?\n\n                          O'RYAN (O.S.)\n                Yes?\n\n     Mackelway opens the door. Looks inside.\n\n     Here sits O'Ryan, looking as much like a tweedy professor as\n     he can look. He rises, smiles warmly.\n\n                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                Agent Mackelway. Come in...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n59   INT. DAITZ' OFFICE - LATER NIGHT                                  59\n\n     A tiny, cramped hovel. Books, papers, and all of it jammed to\n     overflowing. Mackelway sits across from O'Ryan...\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                    (as \"Daitz:\")\n                ...The name of this theory was \"Suspect\n                Zero.\"\n                    (Mackelway nods)\n                The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a\n                serial killer were diabolical enough, he\n                could traverse the country without ever\n                being caught, killing randomly.\n\n                                                         42.\n\n\nThere's a COLLECTION here in a glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS -\ncrude knives, swords, blow-darts. Mackelway notes them.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Tell me, what makes a killer catchable?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Patterns, repetition of behavior.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no\n           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden\n           desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of\n           evil, killing without ever leaving a\n           single meaningful clue in his wake...\n           He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he?\n           Your task forces, your forensics teams -\n           they'd be helpless.\n\nMackelway looks over Daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume\nabout evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of\nserial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Is that something you believe in,\n           Professor? Evil?\n\n                    O'RYAN\n          As a citizen of the world, it's hard not\n          to. Wouldn't you say?\n              (Mackelway can't argue)\n          Evil is all around us, I think - a part\n          of the natural order of things. Like\n          gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave,\n          corrupting everything it touches. A virus\n          invades a cell, causing it to\n          dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did\n          it ever occur to you that something may\n          have invaded that virus, something\n          capable of using it to mutate so\n          powerfully?\n\nMackelway pauses, considering that.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Just because something's invisible to us\n           doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n\nMackelway is silent: Something's off here. But he can't say\nfor sure just yet what it is...\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?\n\n                                                         43.\n\n\nThat wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it\nwas a red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.\n\n                        MACKELWAY\n           I'm sorry?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           A shark, as we know, will only attack\n           humans if he runs out of food. But\n           biologists have theorized that for a\n           shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an\n           endless buffet. He'd never run out of\n           food, so he'd have no need to come to the\n           surface. Consequently, we would never see\n           him. Do you follow?\n               (Mackelway doesn't)\n           We'll never see one. But that doesn't\n           mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect\n           Zero.\n\nMackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient\nweapons... Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his\nsidearm, as O'Ryan continues:\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Some of my colleagues think I'm\n           fascinated with evil. I think the truth\n           is just the opposite: evil is fascinated\n           with us. What better vehicle could there\n           be for creating havoc in the world - what\n           better instrument - than Man? We're vain,\n           we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have\n           an imagination that is limitless in its\n           perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying\n           to harness us. Wouldn't you?\n\nThe more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting\nthat gun...\n\nThen, disturbing the silence, a KNOCK at the door.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Excuse me.\n\nO'Ryan rises, goes to the door... as Mackelway unholsters his\ngun. O'Ryan opens the door. Standing here is a COED, with a\nbackpack. She looks confused.\n\n                     COED\n           Oh. I'm sorry. I was looking for\n           Professor--\n\n                                                                44.\n\n\n     Just like that, O'Ryan has bolted past the Coed, literally\n     tossing her onto Mackelway, exploding into the hall.\n\n     She screams. Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as\n     time allows, then blows out of the room...\n\n60   INT. BUILDING - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                   60\n\n     O'Ryan turns a corner, vanishing. Mackelway follows.\n\n61   INT. BUILDING - CORRIDOR CORNER - CONTINUING                     61\n\n     Mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor: One\n     door after another, for what seems like a mile. But no O'Ryan.\n     Then Mackelway spots an EXIT SIGN. A stairwell...\n\n62   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING                                      62\n\n     Mackelway enters. The stairs go six stories UP from here...\n     and one story DOWN. A sub-basement.\n\n     It's a guess. He descends, gun drawn.\n\n63   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING                                   63\n\n     Mackelway emerges. \"B-2\" looks a lot like B-1: long and\n     endless. We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water,\n     the wheezing of an old generator...\n\n     And, on all sides of us, DOOES, a mile of them: maintenance\n     offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens one - a janitor's\n     supply. No one in here.\n\n     Tries another door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked.\n     Air sucks through a corridor around us. He thinks he hears\n     footsteps around a corner. Runs at them.\n\n64   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING                          64\n\n     Nothing. No one. Just another vast corridor. More doors.\n\n     Then, a sound. GLASS, shattering on the floor. He runs down\n     the corridor, passing a long metal CAGE that houses this\n     building's FIVE FURNACES. They're old and wheezy.\n\n     It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide.\n\n     Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted\n     glass. A sign on it reads \"Neuropsychiatric Lab.\" That's where\n     the sound came from... he thinks.\n\n                                                                 45.\n\n\n65   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING                              65\n\n     Mackelway enters. The lab is dark. He throws on every light\n     switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the\n     shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER.\n\n     So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work-\n     stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it.\n     Lining the walls are wide CABINETS.\n\n     But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of\n     BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the \"stacks\" -\n     perfect for hiding behind.\n\n     He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row\n     #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out...\n\n     He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching,\n     nudging open cabinets. One has been opened:\n\n     Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been\n     unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it...\n\n     In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's\n     tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it.\n     Kneels down, looking into darkness...\n\n     Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open...\n     And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck.\n\n66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66\n\n     Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside\n     him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage\n     has been left ajar...\n\n67   INT. \"FURNACE ROOM\" - CONTINUING                                  67\n\n     Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by\n     steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn.\n\n     He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the\n     humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath\n     us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1...\n\n     ...and is assaulted, from above.\n\n     O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp\n     CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's\n     gun skids across the floor.\n\n     And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze.\n\n                                                                46.\n\n\n     He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head\n     is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting\n     fuzzy.\n\n     We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own\n     BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of\n     that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE?\n\n     O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control.\n\n     Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of\n     FOOTSTEPS. And we hear:\n\n                          MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n                Hey! You! What're you doing down here!\n\n     We turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush toward us, keys jangling.\n     It's all foggy, wavy, distorted.\n\n     We see O'Ryan RISE. Then everything goes black...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n68   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   68\n\n     Mackelway's head is ringing. Feels like he can hear\n     electricity in the walls around him. Slowly, he awakens. Above\n     him are fluorescent lights. Monitors blink...\n\n     Fran is here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries to sit up. The\n     shock of pain from his chest stops him.\n\n                          FRAN\n                How ya doin'?\n\n     Mackelway half-nods. His chest is bandaged.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                We're gonna need everything you can\n                remember about this guy, Tom. Physical\n                description, any kind of distinguishing\n                characteristics.\n\n     That was terse. Charlton looks pretty pissed-off.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (scratchy)\n                Where is he?\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked\n                in on it.\n                    (before Mack can ask:)\n                          (MORE)\n\n                                                         47.\n\n\n                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n           They're fine. But the description they\n           gave of him wasn't worth a damn.\n\nMackelway nods.\n\n                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n           Case you're curious the real Professor\n           Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the\n           country. We can't find him.\n               (Mackelway nods)\n           Whose idea was it to meet there?\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n           His, Sir.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone?\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n           No, Sir.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on\n           the head if you wrapped this whole thing\n           up without any help - is that it?\n\nThe truth? Charlton has him pegged. But:\n\n                     FRAN\n           Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent\n           Mackelway was acting under the assumption\n           that I'd already checked the guy out.\n           We're both to blame.\n\nHold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright\nlie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced.\n\nCharlton, however, seems unmoved...\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview\n           unaccompanied?\n\n                     FRAN\n               (reluctantly)\n           Yes, Sir.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Then whose fuck-up is it?\n\nMackelway eyes her: \"Thanks for trying.\" She nods.\n\n                                                                 48.\n\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (at Charlton)\n                It was... poor judgment, Sir.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                You wanna work alone, start your own\n                agency.\n\n     Mackelway can do nothing but nod. Then, bailing him out,\n     another COMPOSITE ARTIST enters, tools in hand. Charlton\n     sighs, frustrated.\n\n                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                    (re: Composite Artist)\n                Let's get you two started.\n\n     Composite Artist is ready to begin...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n69   INT.

Music and praise filling the room.\n\n     We move along the pews, until we came to the very back row...\n     There, one man sits. Alone. Quiet. O'Ryan.\n\n     Odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this\n     rousing music, or feel the power of this place. People in the\n     next row are stomping their feet. Music soars.\n\n     But O'Ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to WEEP\n     in the middle of this boisterous congregation.\n\n     Outside, an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard, rumbling by with\n     great force. No one else in here seems to hear it.\n\n     But O'Ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing...\n\n70   EXT.

We TILT UP from it... to find that those STORMCLOUDS\n     once in the distance are upon us now.\n\n     And they are pulsing with menace. Rain, wind, lightning,\n     thunder. Like a black wave, about to descend...\n\n71   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FBI OFFICE - \"FAX ROOM\" - SAME                 71\n\n     One of those five FAX MACHINES begins to ring.

It's the BAND-LEADER, who is\n     taking note of the weather gathering overhead.

LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - MOMENTS LATER                 84\n\n     Hardly a sound in here. Mackelway stands at the register,\n     paying for his TAKE-OUT. Another night with nothing but his\n     thoughts for company. Great. Then:\n\n                          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                Agent Mackelway?\n\n     It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by\n     herself in a nearby booth.

Character.\n\n     And candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway\n     and Katie all over the walls.\n\n     An odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the\n     floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American\n     drums providing the pulse.\n\n     It's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the\n     intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly,\n     their eyes locked. She's breathless.\n\n                                                                52.\n\n\n     First time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that\n     furnace room. A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest.\n     Dried blood can be seen beneath it.\n\n     There's an intensity in his eyes. The chanting, the candles,\n     Katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an\n     intensity into his eyes. It's dark, primal.\n\n     And he's been expressing it for an hour without relent...\n     which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge\n     of the bed, exhausted.\n\n     She reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. The chanting\n     dies down into silence. She catches her breath.\n\n                          KATIE\n                    (softly)\n                I can't anymore.\n\n     Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the\n     VOLUME on that boom-box back UP. The chanting fills the room\n     again.\n\n     And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently.\n     That primal side hasn't been sated yet...\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n86   INT.

He unwraps the gauze over that fat\n     bandage soaked through with blood.\n\n     He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep\n     gash. Dried blood, torn skin, bruising. Looks like hell. But\n     Mackelway eyes it calmly.\n\n     He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the\n     wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the\n     doorway.

You have any idea\n                the kind of favors I had to pull with the\n                Abilene cops to cover your ass?!\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Sir...\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                    (not allowing him to talk)\n                Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house\n                without a shred of evidence and NO\n                WARRANT?!\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                    (not going down without a\n                     fight)\n                The sample I took from Speck's bumper...\n                It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with\n                oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the\n                odor of the acid.\n\n     Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through.\n\n                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                It was SPECK not his killer who was\n                hiding something.\n\n                          CHARLTON\n                Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent\n                from Dallas gets sent down to the\n                Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give\n                you TWO WORDS... Hell I'll even write it\n                down for ya.\n\n     Charlton leans in to emphasize his point. He pulls out a pad\n     and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using\n     Mackelway's chest as support. It's humiliating.\n\n                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                \"EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE.\" Don't talk about\n                it.

Charlton\n      tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into\n      Mackelway's hand.\n\n                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                 Turns out you were right about this guy.\n                 You were right about both of them. But\n                 that doesn't change the fact that you\n                 went about your business like a rookie.\n                 Got it?\n\n      Charlton turns, the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence\n      throwing a circle of light around the Yukon. Mackelway watches\n      as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away.\n\n      A sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of\n      Mackelway's hand, he stares at it, as it disappears into\n      darkness.\n\n103   INT.

Driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't\n      notice that there's a SIREN wailing behind him.\n\n      He looks in the rear-view. A TEXAS STATE TROOPER is on his\n      tail. Shit. O'Ryan tightens, pulling over...\n\n114   INT./EXT. STOLEN CAR - ROADSIDE - CONTINUING                      114\n\n      The TROOPER approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle.\n      He stands before O'Ryan's window.

Is there a problem?\n\n      O'Ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an I.D. Hands it\n      over.\n\n      Trooper eyes it. According to this i.d., we are now staring at\n      \"James Garvey\" from Littleton, Colorado. But the Trooper\n      doesn't seem too convinced.\n\n                           TROOPER\n                 See your registration, please?\n\n                            O'RYAN\n                 Sure.\n\n      O'Ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching\n      through it.

There is no way in hell he's going to let\n      himself get deterred by a State Trooper. But he gets out.\n\n115   EXT.

I'd like\n           to hand it over, voluntarily, so you\n           won't think I'm trying to conceal\n           anything. Would that be all right?\n\n                     TROOPER\n           What kind of weapon, Sir?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           It's a hunting knife, right here on my\n           hip.\n\nTrooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed KNIFE - the\none O'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath O'Ryan's\nshirt.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           I was on my way to the woods.

The light is spotty out\n      here... but it's just strong enough to show us the expression\n      on his face: a look of pure awe.\n\n118   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - ENTRY - CONTINUING                118\n\n      The door bursts open. The greasy bag and the soda fall to the\n      floor. Mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. He\n      dials hurriedly.\n\n119   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME                           119\n\n      We're in a PARKING LOT outside a WAL-MART. Fran's just thrown\n      a bag into her Ford Taurus. Her CEL-PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.\n\n                           FRAN (INTO CEL)\n                 Kulok.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)\n                 He really was FBI.\n\n                           FRAN\n                 Huh?\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep.\n                 Fran, he was FBI.\n\n      He can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what\n      was in that file now; PAGES are splayed across Mackelway's\n      coffee table:\n\n      A copy of an FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores,\n      citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career of Special\n      Agent Benjamin O'Ryan... in black and white.\n\n                          FRAN\n                That's impossible.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                I'm look at his whole history!\n                Citations, letters of commendation, even\n                his fucking test scores from Quantico.\n                The guy was an agent.\n\n                          FRAN\n                I don't believe it.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Listen to me--\n\n                                                         70.\n\n\nThen we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Shit! Hold on.\n\nThat irritated her. Mackelway clicks over.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Yes?\n\n                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)\n           Read anything interesting lately?\n\nMackelway's eyes go wide.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Where are you?\n\nCLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Shit!\n\nHe stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting\nto Fran.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           That was him.\n\n                     FRAN\n           He called you at home?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Yes.\n\nBEEP. Call-Waiting again.\n\n                     FRAN\n           Jesus. Call me back.\n\nMackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)\n           O'Ryan?\n\n                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)\n           I've found him, you know.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Who?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Zero.\n\n                                                          71.\n\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Zero's a myth. You made him up.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Do you?\n\nSounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve:\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Was she pretty?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Huh?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           I could hear her moaning, right under the\n           Navajo chanting. Whole thing was\n           downright tribal. What's she look like?\n\nThat was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling\nviolated, feeling \"watched.\" He draws the blinds. Double bolts\nthe front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any\nkind of wire tapping.\n\nBut Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with\nO'Ryan on the phone.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n               (calmly)\n           You tell me.\n\nO'Ryan laughs. He liked that.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Fair enough. We'll stick to business:\n           How'd ya like my old room?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Huh?\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           \"Hope House.\" You were there.\n\nHow the hell did he know that? It's unsettling.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Dyson re-paint it?\n               (no reply)\n           My room. Did he re-paint it?\n\n                                                                  72.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Yeah. White.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 ...But you saw what was underneath, of\n                 course.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 No. Tell me about it.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 No. You tell me.\n\n      CLICK. O'Ryan just hung up. Mackelway stares at the phone.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n120   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (9 P.M.)                          120\n\n      More rain falls outside. Lightning too. Mackelway waits here.\n      Piper's in his usual spot in front of the TV. Dyson descends\n      the stairs, a bit testy tonight.\n\n                           DYSON\n                 Welcome back.\n\n      That had some edge. Mackelway doesn't reply.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n121   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT            121\n\n      Mackelway stands in the center of this room, Dyson in the\n      doorway. That SINGER down the hall is at it again, off-key as\n      ever. Tonight it's the \"Gilligan's Island\" theme-song.\n\n                           DYSON\n                 I'll be in my office.\n\n      Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar.\n\n      Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed, sink, window,\n      the leaky ceiling, the bucket, the peeling paint. This room is\n      heaving with energy...\n\n      He sits on the bed, checks his watch. 9:05 p.m.\n\n      Opposite this bed is that WALL, re-painted in industrial\n      white, with the hint of a shape underneath. It's what\n      Mackelway's come here to investigate. INTERCUT WITH...\n\n                                                                 73.\n\n\n122   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME                           122\n\n      O'Ryan sits at a desk: eyes closed, writing pad at his wrist.\n      On it, more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to\n      us. They're called IDEOGRAMS.\n\n      He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them, as if\n      receiving information from it, and we jump back into:\n\n123   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                123\n\n      Mackelway. Sitting. Staring. Outside this room we hear that\n      awful, toneless singing as it fills the hallway.\n\n      Mackelway rises, approaching that re-painted wall. He pulls\n      out his keys. Checks to see that no one's watching.\n\n124   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       124\n\n      O'Ryan, his pen on that pad, his concentration total.\n\n125   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                125\n\n      We hear the singing, the TV, the rain, that bucket collecting\n      drips. Semi-darkness... until MORE LIGHTNING throws a burst of\n      white light against that wall.\n\n      A faint shape becomes visible, just beneath the white paint.\n      Then it vanishes again.\n\n      Using his keys, he begins to scratch away at the white paint.\n      It's an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the\n      last few days it makes an odd kind of sense.\n\n      Instantly, a hint of BLACK can be seen underneath...\n\n126   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       126\n\n      O'Ryan, at that desk. Outside, he can hear an 18-WHEEL TRUCK\n      rumble by. He doesn't allow it to distract him.\n\n127   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                127\n\n      Mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall.\n      More BLACKNESS appears beneath it. Then, a SOUND behind him.\n      He turns.\n\n      The door to this room just SHUT; someone outside must've\n      pushed it. He keeps scratching at the paint.\n\n      LIGHTNING rages outside. We PULL BACK, away from that wall,\n      which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway\n      is too close to the wall to see for himself:\n\n                                                                  74.\n\n\n      There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white\n      paint. It is the shape of a vast, black WAVE. A hand-painted\n      image as large as this wall itself.\n\n      Mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black\n      that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal.\n\n      In fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow\n      him whole... and he can't even see it.\n\n      But we can. Must've taken O'Ryan days to paint something this\n      large. A vast, black wave. Evil itself...\n\n      And Mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it.\n\n128   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        128\n\n      O'Ryan, somehow, seems to be sensing what is going on in that\n      room. Or maybe he's just feeling the power of that wave, from\n      memory. Or maybe he's just plain crazy.\n\n      But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are\n      feeding one another...\n\n129   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 129\n\n      Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly,\n      revealing more of the blackness underneath. We PUSH IN on it,\n      moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping.\n\n      Then we're beneath that thin coat of white, and:\n\n130   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME                    130\n\n      Somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself. A black, tidal\n      force of nature.\n\n      And it is MOVING. Alive. We hear the SOUNDS of it: a sucking,\n      a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before\n      exploding forward.\n\n      The sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that\n      bucket... Evil itself, on the move, gathering might. And we're\n      along for the ride...\n\n      The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon.\n      It is massive, powerful, dark. And we're right on its forward\n      edge, as if surfing it somehow.\n\n131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131\n\n      O'Ryan reacts. Something just changed:\n\n                                                                  75.\n\n\n132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132\n\n      The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a\n      tsunami.\n\n      ...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY.\n\n133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133\n\n      O'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but\n      they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY...\n\n134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134\n\n      The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the\n      background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the\n      squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING.\n\n      Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a\n      moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens:\n\n      We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels\n      like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images\n      appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness.\n\n      Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE.\n\n135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135\n\n      Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now -\n      enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave,\n      its lip. He continues.\n\n136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136\n\n      O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something\n      from the past, the present, the future...\n\n137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137\n\n      We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself.\n      There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's\n      mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40.\n\n      Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy\n      diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table.\n\n138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138\n\n      O'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it\n      is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead.\n\n                                                               76.\n\n\n139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139\n\n      The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up\n      at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine.\n\n      We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy\n      with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie.\n\n140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140\n\n      O'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part\n      of him is becoming tense.\n\n141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141\n\n      Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of\n      that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take\n      that in.\n\n142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142\n\n      That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running\n      we know not where.\n\n143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     143\n\n      O'Ryan's foot starts to tap: anxiousness, discomfort.\n\n144   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144\n\n      We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without\n      effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave.\n\n      Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back\n      door, which leads on to that Play Area.\n\n      And we hear a horrified yell:\n\n                           KATHLEEN (O.S.)\n                 Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?!\n                     (fainter)\n                 Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?!\n\n      The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken\n      over by the sounds of that awful WAVE...\n\n145   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              145\n\n      Mackelway suddenly stops... as if some electric charge had\n      just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness. He\n      begins to step away from the wall.\n\n                                                                  77.\n\n\n146   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                        146\n\n      O'Ryan has lost the \"pulse\" - the connection that had allowed\n      him inside what we just witnessed.\n\n      He rises, hurrying into a tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT\n      WRITING PAD, trying to decipher these lines and squiggles -\n      the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of O'Ryan, retching.\n\n147   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 147\n\n      Mackelway sits on the bed, looking at what he's just\n      uncovered. An awesome sight. His head is pounding worse than\n      ever... so he reaches for the Vicoden.\n\n148   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         148\n\n      We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs\n      her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK\n      blows by us in the distance...\n\n149   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        149\n\n      O'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror,\n      scrutinizing himself.\n\n150   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 150\n\n      On the wall opposite Mackelway, that huge black wave is now\n      entirely visible to him. Bits of chipped white paint litter\n      the floor.\n\n      A vast black wave. It fills the whole wall...\n\n      Mackelway eyes his watch. It's one o'clock in the morning.\n      He's been in here for four hours. That seems impossible.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n      ...a box, slamming down hard on a desk. We are:\n\n151   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT                        151\n\n      2:30 a.m. Mackelway is in here by himself, angry. He reaches\n      into that box. Inside? More pins. BLACK ONES. He crosses to\n      the map.\n\n152   CLOSE-UP: MACKELWAY                                               152\n\n      He starts pulling out the YELLOW PINS we've grown accustomed\n      to seeing on this map, replacing them with the BLACK ONES,\n      tossing the discards onto the floor.\n\n                                                                  78.\n\n\n153   A SERIES OF DISSOLVES                                             153\n\n      ...as Mackelway replaces pin after pin.\n\n      ...Mackelway's face, as he backs away from that huge map.\n\n154   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATER NIGHT                       154\n\n      Ten minutes have passed, but Mackelway has seen a revelation.\n      We can read it on his face.\n\n      He eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000\n      BLACK PINS, one for each city with a HAVE YOU SEEN ME to its\n      credit.\n\n      And those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we\n      weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when\n      the pins were yellow.\n\n      Looks like a big black WAVE. And that's just what it is.\n\n      1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that\n      O'Ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave\n      of darkness, gathering strength.\n\n      But this black wave is consuming America...\n\n      Mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. The thing\n      seems vast, unstoppable... A black wave - pure malevolence,\n      covering the states like a fog.\n\n      One blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart\n      of Greenville, Texas. Then, piercing the silence:\n\n                           CHARLTON (O.S.)\n                 Got one of those pins in Denton yet?\n\n      Mackelway turns. Charlton leans in the doorway.\n                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                 O'Ryan was spotted there tonight. Took a\n                 squad-car and a side-arm from a State\n                 Trooper. 'Bout an hour later a five-year\n                 old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up\n                 the Interstate.\n\n      It's 3 a.m. What's this guy doing here?\n\n                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)\n                 The vehicle was found in an abandoned\n                 lot. We're establishing a perimeter\n                 around the city now.\n\n                                                         79.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n               (knows already)\n           But the Trooper wasn't hurt...\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           What makes you so sure?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Professional courtesy.\n\nCharlton's at a loss... until Mackelway gestures to the table,\nwhere he has laid out O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo,\ncitation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.\n\nCharlton eyes it, calmly. He's not going to let his jaw drop,\nnot with Mackelway watching. So he just nods.\n\n                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Is that... possible, Sir? An agent can\n           just be deleted?\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Looks like it.\n\n Mackelway pauses. It's a depressing reality...\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           I couldn't understand it before - pushing\n           Speck's car onto the state line. Makes\n           sense now. He wanted to make the case\n           Federal. He's drawing us in.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Why would he do that?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           So we'd be paying attention when he found\n           Suspect Zero.\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired\n           of hearing that word. In fact, that's\n           gonna be policy from now on. No Zero.\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta\n           Quantico. All he's doing is working a\n           case, like we would. He's not kidnapping\n           little kids - he's chasing the guy who's\n           doing the kidnapping! Look at the map!\n\n                                                       80.\n\n\n                     CHARLTON\n           What're you saying - that all these\n           abductions are the work of one guy? Do\n           you know how fucking insane that is?!\n               (over Mackelway)\n           Not let's try something that actually\n           makes sense: He sends in these faxes,\n           picks off three scumbags. For what?! So\n           we'll think exactly what you're thinking\n           right now - that we've got a friend out\n           there, somebody willing to take out the\n           garbage for the rest of us. And it's all\n           horse-shit!\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           What if it isn't? What if there really is\n           a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy\n           who's got a shot at him?\n\n                     CHARLTON\n               (just blew his top)\n           Fuck's sake, Mackelway - when did you\n           start buying into this guy?!\n\nA beat.

He hears Charlton,\n      leaving the building.\n\n      He slams another Vicoden, then hears a PHONE RING. Fuck it.\n      He's not moving.

There's that wave\n      of black pins, with the one BLUE PIN in its center;\n      Greenville, with a \"10-26\" written beside it.\n\n      Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a\n      black one.

He likes her, despite\n      himself.\n\n      Then a MAN passes by him, a trucker. Let's call him VIC.\n\n      All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm: a cobra.\n      Keys jingle on his belt-hook. He wears a sleeveless down vest\n      and a \"God Bless America\" cap.\n\n      Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us.\n\n      Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk,\n      the attitude. Something.\n\n      So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic\n      crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast.\n      Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched.\n\n      Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to\n      distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee.\n      Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again.\n\n      And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig...\n\n      But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his\n      car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly...\n      all of this visible through the windshield.\n\n      Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit...\n\n      Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like\n      he's saying \"Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!\" He might be\n      little Charlie - we can't tell from here.\n\n      But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: \"Shut up!\"\n\n      And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling\n      dairy products.\n\n      On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as\n      coincidence. He might not be so vigilant.\n\n      This isn't a normal day. He races for the door.\n\n169   EXT.

ROAD/INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                     170\n\n      He follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road\n      approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them -\n      Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate.\n\n      Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between\n      them.\n\n      Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to\n      it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail.\n\n      He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from\n      ten states.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)\n                 This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a\n                 plate.

A\n      few pick-ups.\n\n      There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel,\n      and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must\n      be a thousand people in attendance today.\n\n      Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching:\n\n      Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year-\n      old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still\n      screaming and flailing.\n\n      Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, \"Behave or\n      else.\" Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival.\n\n                                                                  94.\n\n\n172   EXT.

We CROSS\n      THE LOT WITH HIM.\n\n      He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's\n      the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We\n      still can't tell if it's Charlie.)\n\n      Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of\n      course. And he can't shoot his way in.\n\n      He looks to the kid inside:\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 You okay?\n                     (Kid's a blank)\n                 Kid? You okay in there?\n\n      The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit...\n      Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still\n      visible to us, but he won't be for long.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                     (at the Kid)\n                 I'll be back. Don't worry.\n\n      Mackelway heads into the carnival.\n\n173   EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUING                                        173\n\n      He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling\n      TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy.\n\n      Running... because we just lost sight of Vic.\n\n      Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a\n      tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that\n      Vic on the other side of it?\n\n      Mackelway takes off.\n\n174   EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING                                    174\n\n      No Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back\n      in the direction of the parking lot.\n\n      He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn\n      machine, past those ladies selling tickets.\n\n                                                                 95.\n\n\n175   EXT. PARKING LOT - RESUMING                                      175\n\n      He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts\n      through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big-\n      rigs, then turns a corner and:\n\n      ...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan.\n\n      The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to\n      recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away.\n\n      Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A\n      second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to\n      face with O'Ryan.\n\n      And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 Well, well... Must be quite a moment for\n                 you. Congratulations.\n\n      Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until:\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 What're you doing here?\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 Waiting for you.\n\n      ...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right\n      in front of Vic's rig.\n\n      But he wasn't expecting what comes next:\n\n      Vic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns\n      out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door,\n      unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.\n\n                           FIVE YEAR-OLD\n                 Mommy!\n\n      The kid dives into the Woman's arms.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                 Morning, Baby!\n\n                           VIC\n                 I told you she'd be here.\n                     (to Woman)\n                 He's been a brat all morning.\n\n                                                                  96.\n\n\n      Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread\n      things, badly.\n\n      And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                     (at O'Ryan)\n                 Hands up.\n\n      O'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs.\n\n                                                        CUT TO:\n\n176   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                       176\n\n      O'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him\n      to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the\n      backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek.\n\n177   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               177\n\n      Mackelway gets in, hits the ignition. Reaches for his cel-\n      phone.

MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER               178\n\n      Through sparse traffic, heading for an Interstate on-ramp.\n                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                I'm talking about uncompromised justice.\n                No trials. No lawyers. No hiccups in a\n                chain of evidence that can set a monster\n                free. You of all people should be able to\n                appreciate the value of that.\n\n                          MACKELWAY\n                Where's the boy?\n\n                          O'RYAN\n                I won't be doing this much longer.\n                Actually, this is the end of it.

Where's the boy?\n\nO'Ryan can't help it. He's pleased.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Good. This is good. Sort of thing you'd\n           never find in a procedural manual. It\n           tells me I was right about you.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n               (cocking the hammer)\n           I will kill you, O'Ryan.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           I know. But we have work to do first.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Where's the Goddamn kid?!?!\n\nSilence... Then that CEL-PHONE rings. Must be Fran.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Don't pick that up.\n\nMackelway eyes him: are you kidding? It rings again.\n\n                    O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n              (a panicked offer)\n          This is the guy who put all those pins in\n          that map of yours!

Then O'Ryan smiles... and\n      points to his own forehead.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 Right here...\n\n      Mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh.\n\n                             MACKELWAY\n                 Fuck you.\n\n      He punches the \"Talk\" button, taking his eyes off O'Ryan for a\n      split second.\n\n      ...What follows is a blur:\n\n      O'Ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed\n      wrists over Mackelway's head, yanking Mackelway out of his\n      seat with a violent tug. The gun falls.\n\n      We POP OUTSIDE THE YUKON, pulling back... obscuring our view\n      of what's going on inside that truck.\n\n      That cel-phone continues to ring... We keep pulling back,\n      under this sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling.\n\n      The cel-phone stops ringing. CONTINUE PULLING BACK, taking in\n      the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the\n      peril beneath them...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n179   INT.

She reaches for that cel-phone again...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180\n\n      Mackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms\n      and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED.\n\n      And he is staring into his own REFLECTION.\n\n      He lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor,\n      just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look\n      at but himself.\n\n      He strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them.\n      He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to\n      watch it all with perfect clarity.\n\n                                                        100.\n\n\nA few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the\nskin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A\nCANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Are you afraid?\n\nThere was a delight to that question - we can see it on\nO'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the\ngag. But the answer's obvious.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (quoting himself, as Daitz:)\n           \"Imagine a killer with no patterns, no\n           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any\n           kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A\n           perfect vessel of evil.\"\n\nAll Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his\neyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           And the name we give that killer... is\n           Zero.\n               (again:)\n           Are you afraid?\n\nSlowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on\nthe floor. It GLOWS. Good God...\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           It'd be customary at this point to start\n           praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't\n           seen too many answers though. I wouldn't\n           hold my breath waiting for another\n           janitor to break in here and save you,\n           either. You're alone.\n\nMackelway tries to speak. It's impossible.\n\nO'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for\nMackelway to say:\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Where's the boy?\n\nO'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n               (re: the mirror)\n           My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to\n           watch yourself say something so heroic.\n           I'm almost envious.\n                     (MORE)\n\n                                                           101.\n\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (casually)\n           The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are\n           you afraid?\n\nMackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then\nlooks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it...\n\nO'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           I know what you're thinking: \"There is\n           pain coming. Am I going to take it like a\n           man?\" Let me put you at ease: You won't.\n           None of them do. Men, women, children.\n           They all weep, they all beg. They pass\n           out, they piss themselves. They attempt\n           negotiation: You wouldn't believe how\n           many men have lain right where you're\n           lying right now - grown men, with wives\n           and children back home - offering all\n           kinds of sexual gratification in exchange\n           for a five minute reprieve. It's\n           pathetic. Are you afraid?\n               (of course, no reply)\n           Then there's that moment when they\n           realize there's nothing left to be\n           negotiated. They're just mine. And\n           they're helpless. And the look in their\n           eyes, the level of surrender... well,\n           it's almost pornographic. I put this\n           mirror here because I don't want you to\n           miss it. Are you afraid?\n\nWith that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is\nRED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful.\n\nBut Mackelway can't look at anything else.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           How about now?\n\nJust like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's\nface. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke\nrise from its edge.\n\nAnd Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it.\n\nHe struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound\ncomes out of him.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Are you afraid?\n\n                                                           102.\n\n\nO'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife\njust under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is\nunbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes...\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?\n\nTwo things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me\nto death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the\nsatisfaction of seeing me cry...\n\nO'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch\nabove Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary\nthat Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke.\n\n                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Are you?\n\nMackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is\nawful. He stares at his own reflection.\n\n...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (top of his lungs)\n           Are you afraid?!\n\nThat bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight -\ncan't watch this anymore.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (infuriated)\n           Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit\n           or I'll cut the fucking lids off!!\n\nMackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep\nsobs shudder through him, as...\n\nO'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm:\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           ARE YOU AFRAID?!?!\n\nMackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am\nterrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag.\n\nWith his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head\nforward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS,\nobliterating the image.\n\n...and everything goes black.\n\n                                                                 103.\n\n\n      Then, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them\n      back:\n\n180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a\n\n      Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've\n      visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote\n      Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through\n      Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the\n      wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of\n      the Navaho.\n\n      But then OTHER IMAGES enter this world. They're jarring:\n\n      -That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth,\n      dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat\n      obscures him, revealing:\n      -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting\n      us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they\n      seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that\n      separates us from them reveals:\n      -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us\n      for something, a job well done, when:\n\n      Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn.\n      He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot.\n\n      A body. He turns it over.\n\n      ...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the\n      mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror,\n      giving way as we...\n\n181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181\n\n      ...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a\n      pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us.\n\n182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182\n\n      Time has passed. We don't know how much. Or maybe we're dead,\n      or dreaming. It's hard to say...\n\n      But there's O'Ryan, at a desk. Writing...\n\n      Mackelway's eyes are open. His FOREHEAD has a bright red\n      raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror.\n\n      But the brain is functioning. It starts running through a\n      check-list:\n\n                                                           104.\n\n\nI'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's\nO'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it\nis searing.\n\nThe check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has\nbeen removed.\n\nAnd MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead.\n\nMackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort.\nEverything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it.\nFlexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it.\n\nThen he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped\naround it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks\nas though a nurse had tended to it.\n\nBut this sure as hell isn't a hospital...\n\nThen, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without\nmeaning to.\n\nBut O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed\nmalevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n               (softly)\n           Stand up.\n\nMackelway pauses, rewinding that one.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           It's over now. Can you stand?\n\nMackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So\nhe's a step behind.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           We really do have to go.\n\nO'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is\nexpecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a\npiece of paper onto Mackelway's lap.\n\nIt's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the\nbackground. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still\ntoo unwound to speak...\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           This is where he'll be. With the boy.\n               (a beat)\n           Zero. He's coming home today. We're going\n           to be there.\n\n                                                        105.\n\n\nMackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An\ninitiation. That stuns him...\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           You're ready to come with me now. You've\n           been in the pit. Stand up.\n\nMackelway eyes him - utter disbelief.\n\nO'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of\nBasic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can\nwe shake on it?\n\nInstead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:\n\nIt is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an\nanimal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back.\n\nThen Mackelway is upon him.\n\nAll the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching\nhimself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable\nsobbing... they ERUPT now into violence.\n\nIt is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it\noff. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand\ncomes down like a sledgehammer.\n\nOne blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are\nsavage, barely human. He's out of control.\n\nO'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around\nthis fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here.\nHe's going to squeeze the life from him.\n\nThis is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild,\nhateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out\nof O'Ryan's throat.\n\nThen Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than\na second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own\ntwisted image.\n\nHe looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined\nto kill this guy.\n\n...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again.\n\n...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An\nanimal.\n\nHis hands, without warning, release their grip.\n\n                                                                 106.\n\n\n      O'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway\n      rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest.\n      That makes breathing a little easier.\n\n      Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM.\n\n183   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING                           183\n\n      Mackelway enters. There's a mirror in here too. That fat\n      BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him.\n\n      He tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm -\n      revealing a hideous wound.\n\n      It's a ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT.\n\n      Now everything clicks: O'Ryan was branding him. Initiating him\n      with that red-hot knife.\n\n      Mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes\n      some water on his face, his mind still reeling.\n\n      Then O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell -\n      face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat...\n\n      Mackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that\n      DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it.\n\n      Then O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the\n      drawing, without a word.\n\n      Mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at\n      O'Ryan's face, just inches away.\n\n      We're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage.\n\n      But O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In\n      fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then:\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                     (re: gun)\n                 Soon. I promise... But not yet.\n\n      He eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then\n      O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the\n      front door.\n\n      Mackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just\n      shoot this fucker in the back.\n\n      Then those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere:\n\n                                                                 107.\n\n\n184   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                          184\n\n      Out of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet\n      wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And\n      that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the\n      sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling:\n\n                           O'RYAN (O.S.)\n                 Please... I'm begging you.\n\n      That was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding\n      it...\n\n      Then those images vanish, and we are jolted back to:\n\n185   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING                             185\n\n      Mackelway tightens. O'Ryan's out the door. This VISION that\n      keeps getting clearer and clearer... What the hell does this\n      it mean?\n\n      Down go two more Vicodens...\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n186   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT                          186\n\n      A huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us. O'Ryan\n      drives. Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face,\n      still recovering from what happened in that room...\n\n      Silence... Then:\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Tell me about Icarus.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 Why?\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Just... wanna know.\n\n      O'Ryan eyes him. The sky is black.\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 There were five of us. In the program.\n\n      Mackelway's all ears...\n\n                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                 We'd come in in the morning, have a cup\n                 of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then\n                 you'd go to your room, with your pen and\n                           (MORE)\n\n                                                         108.\n\n\n                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n             your pad of paper, always alone, and\n             you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John\n             Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be\n             driving his car, or having a beer or\n             brushing his teeth... or cutting\n             someone's eyes out.\n\nThat was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling.\n\n                        O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n             If you did it right, you got all of it:\n             The way it sounded. The way it smelled...\n             Those people were looking up at you,\n             begging you for mercy. It was like being\n             God.\n                  (a beat)\n             ...except you're not. Because you can't\n             do a thing for them. Can't make it stop.\n             You're just watching, helpless.\n\nHe pauses.\n\n                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n             They wired us into this current, the five\n             of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were\n             plugged right into it. But nobody taught\n             us how to shut it off...\n                 (thinking back...)\n             We were just men. And we saw things men\n             shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and\n             it never shut off. Even now, it's still\n             there.\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n             They all wind up like you? The other\n             agents?\n\n                       O'RYAN\n             No. They're dead now.\n\nOh. Mackelway doesn't reply...\n\n                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n             They broke down. Then they opted out.\n                 (Mackelway's a blank)\n             Killed themselves... After a while, those\n             conversations about the Yankees became\n             impossible. Ya see?\n\nMackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-\nlights. Then:\n\n                       MACKELWAY\n             I'm sorry.\n\n                                                                   109.\n\n\n      O'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat\n      back rain...\n\n                                                         CUT TO:\n\n187   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT                      187\n\n      O'Ryan continues to drive. Silence hangs. Then:\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 We're here.\n\n      Mackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at:\n\n188   EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING                   188\n\n      We've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in\n      O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A\n      ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard.\n\n      O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind\n      blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift\n      briefly to the drawing.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Can't bring you in with me. You know\n                 that.\n\n      O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: \"Cuff me.\"\n\n      The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway\n      reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan\n      to club the guy.\n\n      But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops.\n      Simply has to ask:\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                 Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's...\n                 How many of 'em is he actually\n                 responsible for?\n\n      O'Ryan lays it right out:\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 All of 'em.\n\n      Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel\n      and approaches the house.\n\n                                                                 110.\n\n\n189   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING                           189\n\n      The place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint,\n      etc. Mackelway looks through the kitchen window.\n\n      No one's visible. He walks around the side of the house.\n\n190   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 190\n\n      O'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes. This is a moment of\n      opportunity. With his free hand, he reaches into his pocket,\n      grabbing a lighter.\n\n191   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING                              191\n\n      Mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. But now he\n      can see inside the Living Room of this home:\n\n      It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old\n      radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames.\n\n      And an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player.\n\n      Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm\n      is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an\n      old tv in here: \"Wizard of Oz\" is on it.\n\n      The lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND.\n      Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches\n      her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen.\n\n      He moves to another window.\n\n192   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 192\n\n      O'Ryan, keeping his eyes on that house, now lights the\n      lighter... and holds the flame up to the CHAIN connecting his\n      hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel.\n\n      The chain begins to heat up...\n\n193   EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING                                 193\n\n      Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen.\n\n      It, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the\n      center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose.\n      The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old.\n\n      The oven is an antique too. Delia crosses to it, grabs a\n      towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it.\n\n                                                              111.\n\n\n      She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a\n      lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's\n      frosting tube.\n\n      She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins\n      to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly.\n\n      Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The\n      first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: \"Happy Bir...\" It's\n      a work in progress.\n\n194   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                              194\n\n      O'Ryan has that handcuff chain GLOWING now. We don't know if\n      he'll have time to break the thing... until:\n\n      The passenger-side door is opened, abruptly.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 It's his birthday, isn't it?\n\n      O'Ryan turns. Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what\n      O'Ryan's doing with that lighter.\n\n      O'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly. Mackelway decides to\n      ignore the whole thing...\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                 He comes home on his birthday.\n\n      O'Ryan nods. Then Delia's front door swings open.\n\n                           DELIA (O.S.)\n                     (aloud, delighted)\n                 Darling?! That you?!\n\n195   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                          195\n\n      Delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking\n      to the dark rainy street. That confuses them.\n\n      ...until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK.\n\n      It turns a corner onto this street. Mackelway turns now...\n\n      We've seen this truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And\n      Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him,\n      Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.\n\n      But that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the\n      sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking-\n      up on the wet road.\n\n                                                                 112.\n\n\n      Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man\n      of 35... Let's call him ZERO.\n\n      Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again\n      and begins to rumble down the street.\n\n                           DELIA (CONT'D)\n                     (confused)\n                 Daryl? Honey?\n\n      No answer. That truck is rumbling away. Mackelway turns,\n      racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door.\n\n196   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               196\n\n      Mackelway jumps in to the Yukon, unlocking those cuffs.\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Drive.\n\n      He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                     (re: burn)\n                 Fuck!\n\n      Cuffs are unlocked now. O'Ryan starts up the Yukon.\n\n197   EXT. GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING                    197\n\n      O'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel-\n      phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE)\n                     (urgently)\n                 This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north\n                 on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in\n                 Greenville. Request immediate back-up.\n                 Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated\n                 truck, Texas license plate Alpha--\n\n      The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the\n      tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path.\n      Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D)\n                 Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.\n\n      Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the\n      road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on\n      to a curb, then clunks down to the street again.\n\n                                                                 113.\n\n\n      Then Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                     (at O'Ryan)\n                 Brakes!\n\n      O'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop,\n      throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger\n      side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window.\n\n      Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig\n      pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.\n\n198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198\n\n      Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to\n      the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck.\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                     (into cel-phone again)\n                 Travelling due west now. Don't see a\n                 name. It's a service road, running\n                 parallel to the--\n\n      Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that\n      made his jaw drop:\n\n      On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT.\n\n      Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed.\n      Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen\n      it before.\n\n      And so has O'Ryan...\n\n      Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past\n      them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he\n      forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid...\n\n      Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows\n      that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with\n      O'Ryan.\n\n      And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. \"Please...\"\n\n      O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig.\n      Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time.\n      That shreds their front tire.\n\n      ...which means that in one minute this car is going to be\n      undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that\n      Interstate - now - Zero will be gone.\n\n                                                              114.\n\n\n                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n                     (absently)\n                 What're you...\n\n                           O'RYAN\n                 Can't let him hit the Interstate.\n\n      Mackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left\n      side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then:\n\n      He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he\n      jams on the brakes.\n\n      Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a\n      vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab,\n      swatting the Yukon away like a fly.\n\n      We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look\n      like tinker toys.\n\n      The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal\n      hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS.\n\n      The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road,\n      upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out\n      the busted windshield.\n\n      What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig\n      is lying flat on its side.\n\n      And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field...\n\n199   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING                                 199\n\n      The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side\n      door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes\n      immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours.\n\n      Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now\n      opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.\n\n      Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his\n      hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat\n      field - vanishing.\n\n      Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door\n      is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels\n      across the street.\n\n      Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives.\n\n                                                                 115.\n\n\n                            MACKELWAY\n                      (over his shoulder, running)\n                 Get the van open! He's got a kid in the\n                 van!\n\n      STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints\n      into the tall wheat.\n\n      O'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too\n      disappears into that Wheat Field.\n\n200   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING                                     200\n\n      Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to\n      guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's\n      going.\n\n      ...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a\n      feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting.\n\n      He's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front\n      of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing.\n\n      That, too, was presaged. Those visions...\n\n201   EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING                              201\n\n      It's locked. Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock\n      away.\n\n202   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       202\n\n      Mackelway keeps running, deaf and blind.\n\n      O'Ryan is running nearby, but they can't see or hear one\n      another.\n\n203   INT. THE TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                203\n\n      200 sides of beef lie on their sides. Ranger plunges in.\n\n      Then the Ranger spots, in the back of the van, a FALSE-WALL\n      that used to hide a secret compartment.\n\n      The crash has collapsed part of the false-wall. Frozen air\n      blows out in wisps. He climbs over those carcasses, fast as he\n      can...\n\n204   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       204\n\n      Mackelway keeps going, running blind.\n\n                                                                116.\n\n\n      Then, another sound, up ahead. Sounds like the noise of\n      someone stumbling. Mackelway stops. Listens.\n\n      Silence. The sound does not repeat itself.\n\n      He continues along, step by cautious step now.\n\n205   INT. TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                   205\n\n      Ranger gets over the last of the carcasses, pulling himself up\n      to the now-open compartment.\n\n      First thing we see is a REFRIGERATION ROD, the one that was\n      responsible for those freezer burns.\n\n      Then we see Charlie, bound. He's trembling with cold, but he's\n      alive. His leg presses up against the rod.\n\n206   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      206\n\n      Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding. He hears a noise to\n      his left. Whips around, gun poised.\n\n      But it's nothing. He sighs. The wheat almost sounds like it's\n      laughing at him.\n\n      Then that TIRE IRON lashes out, from the right.\n\n      It catches Mackelway with horrific force, shattering his wrist\n      and sending that gun flying into the wheat.\n\n      Before Mackelway can react, Zero is upon him...\n\n207   EXT. THE TOPPLED RIG - RESUMING                                  207\n\n      Fran's Ford skids to a stop outside the van.\n\n      ...just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig. The kid\n      is shaking, traumatized. He begins to cry...\n\n      Fran gets the idea. She hurries over.\n\n208   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      208\n\n      Mackelway and Zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of\n      that wheat... Zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron.\n      Mackelway has a busted wrist. Hardly a fair fight.\n\n      But Mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as\n      many shots as he can. His shirt rips away from his body,\n      exposing that brand-mark. They roll back and forth. Until:\n\n                                                        117.\n\n\n                       O'RYAN (O.S.)\n                 (calmly, firmly)\n           Up.\n\nZero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn to find:\n\nO'Ryan... who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand.\n\n                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           Up.\n\nMackelway's relief is total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero\npulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.\n\n                     ZERO\n               (re: Mackelway)\n           Glad you're here, Man. Guy was about to\n           kill me.\n\nO'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left\npalm. That got Mackelway's attention.\n\nZero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to\nthe ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           I'll take it from here.\n\nHe extends his good hand to O'Ryan: \"The gun.\" O'Ryan pauses.\nThen...\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Are you going to shoot him?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Give me the gun, O'Ryan.\n\n                     ZERO\n           Hey, I just surrendered.\n\n                      O'RYAN\n           Shut up.\n\n                     ZERO\n           I surrendered! That's it!\n\n                       O'RYAN\n           SHUT UP!!!\n\nO'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face.\nThat shuts the guy up in a hurry.\n\n                                                        118.\n\n\nFrom that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS,\napproaching from a distance. Unit after unit.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n               (quietly now)\n           Look at him, Mack. He's not human\n           anymore. Go dig up that old lady's\n           backyard - you'll find bodies there...\n           Maybe hundreds of them. Of course, ya\n           gotta get a warrant first, chain of\n           custody's gotta be followed. One breach,\n           and he walks.\n               (no reply)\n           My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid\n           of him. It's a lot closer to justice than\n           having some Prosecutor tell you you've\n           left a tissue sample in the wrong lab.\n           Isn't it?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n               (that stung)\n           Give me the fucking gun!\n\nO'Ryan turns, studies him.\n\n...and hands him the gun. Just like that.\n\nMackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses\nback to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground.\n\nO'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as:\n\n                     O'RYAN\n               (at Mackelway)\n           You have to understand: none of this was\n           arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.\nWHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage.\nWe hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He\ndrops to his knees, gasping.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           I saw us here. You did too.\nTHUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the\nother side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage\nhave shattered. Breathing is almost impossible.\n\nMackelway tightens. His head just began to throb...\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Okay. You made your point.\n\n                                                        119.\n\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point\n           you would've shot him yourself by now!\n\nAnother swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's\nneck. He crumbles, face down.\n\nFuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right\nup against the back of O'Ryan's head.\n\n                      MACKELWAY\n           Enough!\n\nThen, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.\n\nSomething about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a\nrelief.\n\n                      MACKELWAY (CONT'D)\n           Drop it.\n\n                      O'RYAN\n           Or what?\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Just drop it.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Would you shoot me?\n\nThat's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Put it down.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n               (calmly)\n           I want you to think for a second. About\n           your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed,\n           like I am - except you keep running from\n           it.\n               (Mackelway's silent)\n           You hear things. You see things. That's\n           why you can't sleep, why your head always\n           aches.\n\nHe turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between\nthem.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           ...and it's why you are going to let me\n           kill this animal. And then you're going\n           to kill me.\n\n                                                         120.\n\n\nThat threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment -\nwheeling around...\n\nHe takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire-\niron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is\ndead.\n\nMackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur.\n\nO'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a\nman awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway.\n\nMackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in\nskull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.\n\nBut O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Get up.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this\n           already. For months now.\n\n                     MACKELWAY\n           Get up.\n\n                     O'RYAN\n           Every time, we're in this field: same\n           wind, same rain. And you...\n\nHe puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he\npretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea.\n\n                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n           It's okay.

Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan.\n\nThere's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right\non O'Ryan. His shock is total.\n\n                       FRAN (CONT'D)\n           Drop it.\n\nO'Ryan doesn't move at first.

Unsettling as hell.\n\n     ...and we begin to INTERCUT: images of this moment with images\n     from those \"VISIONS\" that have been hinting at this very\n     wheatfield since Page One...\n\n208a INTERCUT WITH/EXT.

She fires.\n\n     O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron\n     hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground,\n     landing face up.\n\n     ...a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands\n     over him...\n\n     Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as\n     O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as\n     he's dying.\n\n                                                                  125.\n\n\n                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)\n                     (weak)\n                 Thank you.\n\n      Then he dies, eyes open.

Zero's rig remains on its side.\n\n      Mackelway sits nearby on a CURB, his shattered wrist is in a\n      SLING. Up above, the CLOUDS have parted. Morning sun streaks\n      through. No more rain. Fran sits beside him.\n\n      At their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a\n      discarded MILK CARTON, covered with dust. The face under the\n      \"Have You Seen Me?\" is unknown to us.\n\n      Kathleen is nearby, holding Charlie tight. Cops surround them.\n\n      An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives. Charlton hurries out of it, making\n      a bee-line for Mackelway.\n\n                            CHARLTON\n                 Nice work.\n                     (Mackelway half-nods)\n                 Where is he?\n\n                           MACKELWAY\n                 Sir?\n\n                           CHARLTON\n                 O'Ryan.

They leave Charlton behind...\n\n      We PULL AWAY from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of\n      tall wheat, TILTING UP to that morning sun.\n\n                                             MATCH DISSOLVE TO:\n\n      ...an AFTERNOON SUN now - blazing white hot.
