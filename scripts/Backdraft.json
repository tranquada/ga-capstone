FIRE STATION 17 - STORAGE ROOM - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n\n               Darkness. Then the GLINT of a flashlight. Its beam rocks \n               crazily to and fro across the inside of a small storage room \n               as we hear two children arguing.\n\n                                     OLDER KID\n                         You're doing it wrong.\n\n                                     YOUNGER KID\n                         Shut up.\n\n                                     OLDER KID\n                         You're doing it wrong.\n\n               It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping \n               beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef \n               on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African \n               masks.\n\n               Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle \n               into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their \n               pajamas.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         It doesn't go like that.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Who asked you?\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         If you do it like that it'll open in \n                         the fire. Then you'll get burned and \n                         DIE.\n\n               The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a \n               fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands \n               in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS \n               McCAFFREY.\n\n                                     DENNIS\n                         Who's going to die?\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Brian.

FIRE STATION 17 - DAY\n\n               The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out \n               boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats \n               drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty \n               sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat.\n\n                                     DENNIS\n                         Your brother's right.

The other three firemen climb aboard and take their \n               places.\n\n               EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY\n\n               There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine \n               is pulling out of the station.\n\n                                     DENNIS\n                         Hit the button, Brian.\n\n               Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light \n               snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down \n               the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last \n               instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older \n               brother.\n\n               They stick their tongues out.\n\n               EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n\n               The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched \n               between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at \n               intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on \n               sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency \n               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n\n               Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block. \n               Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping \n               off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and \n               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his \n               son.\n\n                                     DENNIS\n                         Stay near the truck.\n                              (winks)\n                         And keep an eye out for us, huh? \n                         We're short handed today.\n\n               Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis \n               smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward \n               a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the \n               cab.\n\n                                     ENGINEER\n                         Don't stray too far, little man.\n\n               Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better \n               look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking \n               on purpose.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n\n               There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian \n               watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox \n               onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window \n               over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.\n\n               Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed \n               with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. \n               A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out \n               the frame with his axe, and dives in.\n\n               A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, \n               smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing \n               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a \n               ladder.\n\n               Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than \n               life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between \n               fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling \n               darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, \n               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing \n               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. \n               The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, \n               don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head \n               staring up in astonishment.\n\n               Nobody else has noticed it.\n\n               Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; \n               probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian \n               starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Dad...\n\n               He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is \n               happening very fast in slow motion:\n\n               -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole \n               as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that \n               beckons him as -- \n\n               Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him \n               clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling \n               fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT \n               and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm \n               that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, \n               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and \n               spins slowly.\n\n               A fire helmet.\n\n               And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, \n               hopeless tears streaming down his face.\n\n                                     AXE\n                         Get us some backup! We need some \n                         goddamn backup!\n\n               And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet \n               spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is \n               raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to \n               its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at \n               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we \n               read the printing on the neck guard.\n\n               MCCAFFREY\n\n               And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, \n               protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian \n               doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his \n               father's helmet, And puts it on.\n\n               The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures \n               the instant.\n\n               INT.

Let it become an aged cover of \n               LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's \n               sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat \n               of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live \n               on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now \n               27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and \n               Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up \n               palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with \"McCaffrey \n               High-End Stereo Sales\".\n\n               EXT.

Brian JUMPS him, shuts off the hose and \n               pins him to the pavement.\n\n                                     TIM\n                         Okay okay!

Tim grabs \n               Brian by the shoulder.\n\n                                     TIM\n                         Let's go, man!\n\n               EXT. STREETS - NIGHT\n\n               Brian and Tim jump into Brian's car. They shoot blindly down \n               the street looking for the fire engine, running down red \n               lights or anything else that gets in their way. Brian suddenly \n               hits the brakes, SCREECHING to a stop. They roll down their \n               windows. Far off can be heard the wind-up of a siren.\n\n                                     TIM\n                              (points)\n                         That way.\n\n               EXT. STREETS - FIRE ENGINE - NIGHT\n\n               SCREECH. They fly around a corner, down a block, and there \n               it is, lights flashing up ahead. Brian GUNS it, roars up \n               alongside the fire engine. Tim leans out the window, shakes \n               a bottle of beer, and lets loose a foamy eruption in the \n               truck driver's face.\n\n                                     DRIVER\n                         Tim!

BROWNSTONE - WALTON AVENUE - NIGHT\n\n               As Brian and Tim pull up two engine companies are already \n               dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode \n               earlier. Tim cheers the firemen on like a drive-in movie.\n\n               Brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. Embers \n               whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him.\n\n               One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He \n               watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person \n               would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian \n               turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are \n               gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian \n               notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice \n               the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield. \n               It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy \n               angles. A dog barks furiously at it.\n\n                                     TIM\n                              (also looking at body)\n                         Man.

And one of the firemen is coming \n               back out now, walking toward Brian.\n\n               When he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask \n               and helmet and we shudder with Brian, because the man is a \n               dead ringer for HIS FATHER.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Well, look what we have here.

Had \n                         a talk with Chief Fitzgerald, and we \n                         decided in the interest of brotherly \n                         love, that maybe you shouldn't be \n                         way over on the other side of town. \n                         So starting tomorrow, your assigned \n                         to company 17.

BROWNSTONE - ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT\n\n               A flame LEAPS up into the foreground. Touches a cigarette. \n               The cigarette glows, lingers, then lowers slowly from the \n               mouth of RIMGALE, fifty-five years old and six and a half \n               feet of solid granite. Wearing a windbreaker and grey slacks \n               tucked into fire department rubber boots, he takes another \n               slow drag. Looks at the body stuffed into the windshield. \n               It's twenty yards away from the brownstone. Stephen looks up \n               as Rimgale drops the cigarette, crushes it with his boot, \n               and crosses the street to the building.\n\n               INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\n               Charred walls hiss and snap in the steamy darkness. Rimgale \n               is there, gloomy in the beam of his flashlight. He crouches \n               down, plays his flashlight along the ruined baseboard.\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         If you stare any longer Stevie, I'll \n                         start charging you admission.\n\n               Stephen is leaning in the doorway, watching him.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Got a cause?\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         Are the glory boys actually showing \n                         interest in Investigation's work?

He lowers it, takes in the walls, \n               the room.\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         They're gonna have to wait a few \n                         days on this one.\n\n               EXT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT\n\n               Tim's talking to his cousin. Brian hangs back, watches the \n               body-bag people load the Porsche driver into a meat wagon. \n               There's a still an audience for this, still stray dogs \n               circling and barking. Brian walks up, looks inside the car, \n               and sees on a seat the ragged remains of a FINGER.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                              (to coroner crew)\n                         Hey, you forgot... this.\n\n               They're already climbing into the wagon. The driver smiles \n               creepily.\n\n                                     CORONER DRIVER\n                         We always leave something for the \n                         dogs.\n\n               Brian looks across the fireground, sees his brother walking \n               back to the fire engine. They share a brief, edgy glance.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\n               A modest one. South-side Irish old fashioned. Brian walks \n               up. There's a little kid, about five, playing with a toy \n               fire truck on the drive.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey, Sean.

How 'bout it, huh?\n\n               Brian pushes past the workers and takes his position on the \n               hose line. Stephen reaches over and re-adjusts Brian's air \n               tank strap.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You're doing it wrong.\n\n               Stephen eases the door open. Thick smoke rolls sickly out \n               over their heads.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                              (to Brian)\n                         Stay beside me.\n\n               And in they go...\n\n               INT. BURNING FACTORY - DAY\n\n               Inside the smoke is like liquid lead. Going by feel, they \n               hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on \n               their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. Turning a \n               corner, they enter\n\n               INT. BURNING FACTORY - A VAST ROOM - DAY\n\n               Totally ablaze. Brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting \n               waves of flame in the ceiling, at the SCREECHING timbers \n               crumbling to the white-hot floor. At the walls HOWLING in \n               bestial agony. It is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing \n               he has ever seen.\n\n                                     AXE\n                         Wash it to the windows?\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         No, we'll hit the son of a bitch \n                         head on.\n\n                                     AXE\n                         It's gonna flash, Stevie.

Go high in the ceiling.\n\n               Adcox and Grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, \n               expecting the worst. Adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose \n               a high pressure BLAST OF WATER into the ceiling. The fire \n               SCREAMS in manic anger and HEAVES a cloud of HOWLING steam \n               that WHIRLS back and BAKES them like lobsters. Brian gasps \n               for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. A window \n               somewhere EXPLODES. Somebody shouts. Christ, you can't see \n               anything. Stephen HOOPS in victory.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                              (to fire)\n                         I knew you were a pussy! C'mon!

Going for the throat while the fire's \n               confused and defensive, the firemen SCRAMBLE through the \n               boiling cloud. They hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, \n               forcing it back and back. It HOWLS and CLAWS in anger, \n               furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. \n               The walls ECHO with its SCREAMS as it retreats to a corner.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Ya love it, probie?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I'm in heaven, Lt.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Hook us up to a stand-pipe.\n\n               Brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the \n               building water system. He goes to unscrew the cap with his \n               hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Jesus, how 'bout man, huh?

Then, a sucking sound: RUSH-RUSH-RUSH... \n               Stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Hey Otis, is it...?\n\n                                     SCHMIDT\n                              (into radio)\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Goddamn it, where's our backup? \n                         Where's the second-in companies?\n\n                                     SCHMIDT'S VOICE\n                         Sorry, man.

A \n               circling of the wagons. -- BOOM! rush-rush-rush -- BOOM! \n               Each louder than the last. Stephen and Brian are ducked behind \n               an overturned desk. Adcox and Krizminski clutch hoselines \n               like frontiersmen's Winchesters.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You're gonna love this.\n\n               -- rush-rush-rush -- CRAAAASH!! On an instant the world comes \n               apart as all four walls of factory windows EXPLODE in a hail \n               of glass. A wave of HOWLING FLAME POURS IN after it, SHRIEKING \n               and HISSING.\n\n               At the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing \n               machine GIVES WAY and a ladderman, SANTOS, FALLS THROUGH, \n               grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames BELLOW UP \n               from underneath. He SCREAMS as his grip loosens.\n\n               Grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and \n               coat. Brian hesitates just an instant and Stephen SHOVES him \n               out of the way to back up Grindle.\n\n                                     SANTOS\n                         Help... Oh God...\n\n               Adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. Water and \n               flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling \n               ROAR. It's a thrashing, murderous standoff.\n\n               Stephen and Grindle have got Santos but the angle's bad. \n               Blow it now and all three could take a header. Santos is \n               panicking, losing his grip. Grindle bores his eyes into the \n               man's with the calm and conviction of Moses.\n\n                                     GRINDLE\n                         You go, we go.\n\n               They may all die, but they won't leave him. He calms a little, \n               hangs on till they PULL him out of harm's way. Adcox continues \n               with the hose as suddenly, everyone HITS the deck as the \n               fire EXPLODES over them, BURSTING their coats into flame. \n               Tim's company opens up their line, WASHING everybody down \n               before CHARGING after the fire. A ladderman, NIGHTENGALE, \n               steps on Brian's back.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey!\n\n                                     NIGHTENGALE\n                         Sorry man, I thought you were dead.\n\n               Brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. Stephen \n               seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over \n               the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he \n               mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a \n               corner. The fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its \n               furious anger. But it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.\n\n                                     PENGELLY\n                              (ladder co. captain)\n                         Stephen! BC's on the radio.

Take Tim and do a search.\n\n               Adcox leads Tim downstairs. Brian looks shaken up. Stephen \n               helps him roughly to his feet.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Don't you fold on me now, man.\n\n               Brian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Clear the hose for me.\n\n               Brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. \n               small voice. Faint. \"Help me...\"\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey, I think it's coming from a \n                         different staircase.\n\n               Nobody hears. -- Brian takes off down the other steps on his \n               own.\n\n               INT.

He turns to backtrack his way out when A TONGUE OF \n               FLAME suddenly LEAPS up through the floor in front of him, \n               cutting off the door. Brian lands on his ass as it hisses \n               and giggles and dances unreally in front of him.\n\n               I never forget a face, kid. -- That fire from childhood.

Looks for another doorway -- \n               And ends up in thick smoke. He drops to a crawl, stays on \n               his belly where the air's clear. When he sees it. Behind \n               some furniture. Something flesh-colored. Shit. It's a body. \n               He crawls up closer. It's a woman. Adrenalin pounding the \n               top of his skull off, he grabs her and stumbles back down \n               the hall, makes a turn --\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I got one!\n\n               EXT.

Brian looks down. The woman looks strange. \n               Mostly because she's a heavy store DRESSING DUMMY. The \n               paramedics burst into laughter. Brian, looking pale and \n               shaken, turns and walks away.

FIRE STATION 17 - LOCKER ROOM\n\n               Brian enters, strips down his battered uniform, and opens \n               his locker. The mannequin from the fire SPRINGS OUT, legs \n               spread. A sign taped to its mouth says: \"TAKE ME BRIAN, YOU'RE \n               MY SUPERMAN!\"\n\n               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - WASHROOM\n\n               Brian and the others scrub the morning's fire off their bodies \n               in the station shower. Tim keeps filling his mouth full of \n               water and launching it upward in a stream.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Do you have to do that?\n\n                                     TIM\n                              (pumped)\n                         Could you believe that fire?

FIRE STATION 17 - BUNKROOM\n\n               Stephen sits alone at his bunk, slowly stretching a strained \n               and ruined back. He blows out a long, tired breath, and begins \n               working ointment into an anciently scarred and battered knee.\n\n               On the wall is a small glass case full of station memorabilia \n               through the years. There's a two battered fire helmets there, \n               set reverently on velvet. Beside it is a photograph of his \n               father. Grinning. Top of the world. He's wearing a T-shirt \n               proudly stenciled FIGHTING 17th.\n\n               Father and son exchange a long, awkward greeting.\n\n               In the doorway, Brian stands watching his brother, who not \n               even 40, suddenly seems an old and broken man.\n\n               The ALARM KLAXON suddenly sounds. Brian, just in a towel and \n               Tim, in boxers covered with little dinosaurs, dash for the \n               fire pole.\n\n               INT.

FIRE STATION 17 - KITCHEN/DINING AREA\n\n               The makings of a meal are laid out on the counter. Brian and \n               Tim come to a screeching halt. The rest of the station is \n               sitting calmly at the kitchen table, watching.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         What's going on?\n\n                                     PENGELLY\n                         Dinner, Probies.

City \n               brass--including Alderman Swayzak -- a few reporters, firemen \n               and their families all mix together for this is a RETIREMENT \n               PARTY for the Captain Fitzgerald. Brian enters, seeks out a \n               beer at the bar. Stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly \n               not his first drink of the evening.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Hey.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey.\n\n               CHEERS as a one joke gift after another is laid on the Chief. \n               Stephen sees his ex-wife, Helen, dancing with another man. \n               He turns away.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         I gotta change the view...\n\n               Santos and Grindle walk up.\n\n                                     GRINDLE\n                         Heard you didn't make the list for \n                         captain, man.

Go!\n\n               Tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his \n               shoulder and runs with Adcox to the foot of the building. \n               There's a fixed standpipe that Adcox ties into as Tim drags \n               the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Go!\n\n               Brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the \n               building.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         That isn't a football, probie. Get \n                         it on your shoulder.\n\n               Brian runs up two flights to meet Tim and connect his end. \n               Tim heads down for another roll as Brian drags his up another \n               two flights. It's a bitch.\n\n               Sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing Tim coming \n               up with another roll.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Having fun, fireman?\n\n               Tim flips him off. Brian laughs and sprints for another roll.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You're not breaking any records, \n                         Brian.\n\n               Brian holds it under his arm and takes off. Stephen grabs a \n               roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Your shoulder. Like this!\n\n               Brian lifts it to his shoulder.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Come on! Pick it up!\n\n               They come to the doorway. Instead of stopping, Stephen follows \n               Brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. Without a word \n               spoken it's become a race between them.\n\n               Brian's face explodes in sweat. His heart pounds as they go \n               up flight after flight. The hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. A \n               thousand. Neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats \n               burning, only one flight from the roof Stephen STUMBLES and \n               SCRAPES his leg. Brian pauses. Stephen's already back on his \n               feet.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Run, damn you!\n\n               Brian does, Stephen already gaining on him -- getting ready \n               to pass him -- when they burst gasping out onto the roof, \n               Brian the \"winner\" by a nose. Stephen drops his hose roll, \n               sticks his face into Brian's, -- And laughs. Unsure, Brian \n               starts to join in. Stephen stops suddenly.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Roll the hose.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         What, are you kidding? By myself?\n\n               Adcox and Tim, down below, have already disappeared back \n               into the station.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You heard me.\n\n               We see now what Stephen apparently doesn't. He was scraped \n               badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         What, is it the stairs?

The fire retreats into \n               another room, SLAMMING the door shut behind it.\n\n               Brian struggles up the stairs. The two of them slide up on \n               either side of the closed door, Stephen cradling his axe \n               like a SWAT team shotgun. The door breathes in and out and \n               something animal scratches and snarls on the other side.\n\n               Brian can feel the panic rising in his throat.

Brian tries to follow but the fire WELLS \n               UP, cutting him off. He hesitates. It's that goddamn flame \n               again, leering at him. Daring him.

Stepping behind a small partition, Rimgale \n               changes his shirt.

Loaded \n               down, Brian follows Rimgale into the building.\n\n               INT. THEATRE BUILDING\n\n               Fire crews are at work in here, including Engine 17 at the \n               other end of the theatre. Brian's surprised to see them, his \n               eyes locking briefly with Stephen's. An ENGINE COMPANY LT. \n               walks up to Rimgale.\n\n                                     ENGINE LT\n                         We were lucky with this one.

The corpse's keys are still in the lock. So's \n               Benton. Blown with such force he seems fused with the door. \n               On the door's edge Rimgale notices a small patch of melted, \n               sticky goo. With his penknife he scrapes a sample and seals \n               it in a glass vial, stands, and walks into the office.\n\n               INT.

Everyone's still stained and smudged from the fire.\n\n               Everyone but Brian.\n\n               Brian looks through a door window into the room. There, \n               surrounded by doctors and physicians, lies Tim. He's been \n               cut out of his uniform. Gauze bandages everywhere. As a pair \n               of forceps peel some away Brian glimpses what used to be a \n               face, now only reds and browns and leaky whites.

Turn to shouts. It's Adcox and \n               Stephen, tearing heartbreakingly into one another. Brian \n               can't make out the words but it's ugly, emotional. Abruptly \n               it ends and Stephen emerges from the alcove, walking toward \n               them upset.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         You had to do it, didn't you?\n\n               Stephen's got other things on his mind.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         ...Not now, Brian.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Had to take on another fire bare-\n                         handed, huh?

SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The red arson sedan pulls up to wealthy home. Rimgale and \n               Brian walk up and knock on the door -- it creaks open ajar. \n               They push the door open slowly.\n\n               INT. SWAYZAK'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               It's dark as they enter.\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         Hello? Swayzak?\n\n               Brian and Rimgale split up down different halls. It's the \n               HISS Brian hears first. Then the FLASH of an electrical socket \n               FLARING ice-cold cobalt blue. Suddenly the room's dimensions \n               are there in frantic, strobing shadows. Chairs, a couch --\n\n               -- And a figure that JUMPS Brian. the light from the burning \n               plug is a fierce strobe as the figure, a confused shadow, \n               crashes Brian to the floor. They STRUGGLE.\n\n               The figure GRABS Brian's throat. Brian PUSHES him back\n\n               -- Against the burning wall plug. The figure SHRIEKS in pain, \n               gets his hand on a crowbar and SLAMS Brian -- who crumples, \n               dazed. The figure stands -- just as Rimgale TACKLES him. The \n               figure CRASHES across a gas space heater, SNAPPING the \n               connection off. The figure SLAMS Rimgale HARD with the \n               crowbar, squirms free, and stumbles out the door.\n\n               Hissss... Rimgale climbs to his feet as fire eats at the \n               wall. A baby backdraft wagging its tail. He goes to a dazed \n               Brian's side, lifting him by his armpits and\n\n               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               helping him outside. Hissss... The ruptured space heater \n               pumps gas furiously. Rimgale sees that. He also sees a bedroom \n               door ajar on the far side of the house. And through the door \n               a couch. And on the couch, A body. Hissss...\n\n               INT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Rimgale rushes back inside. It's Swayzak, unconscious.\n\n               EXT. SWAYZAK HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Rimgale drags him out on the stoop beside Brian just as the \n               gas WHUMPS and the doors and windows EXPLODE in a HOWLING \n               FIREBALL, the shrapnel BLOWING Rimgale off his feet. Brian \n               slowly shakes his head clear. He looks around, tries to orient \n               himself.\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         Uh... I sorta got a problem here...\n\n               Brian climbs up to his feet and walks over to where Rimgale \n               lies at a weird angle, a piece of wrought iron fence punched \n               through his shoulder.\n\n               INT.

He kicks it \n               over and over with frustration till something finally SNAPS \n               off. Brian waits, let's him vent his frustration.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         So what do you want me to do?\n\n                                     SHADOW\n                         I've been lying here hours... just \n                         thinking...

FIRE STATION 17 - UPSTAIRS LOCKER ROOM\n\n               Brian PRIES the lock off Stephen's locker. Starts looking \n               through it. Adcox comes out of the shower with a towel on, \n               starts shaving in a mirror. He doesn't notice Brian. Adcox \n               turns to head for his own locker and the towel slips a little. \n               And Brian's universe caves in.\n\n               An icy claw tears out his stomach. Gulping breaths, he forces \n               himself to look at Adcox's back.\n\n               On it is a small, rectangular burn. It's fresh and it's the \n               size of a wall socket. At that moment Adcox turns. The two \n               of them stare at one another just a beat, then Adcox walks \n               past him. Just then the alarm bells RING. Brian hesitates a \n               beat, confused, then turns and runs down to\n\n               INT. FIRE STATION 17 - APPARATUS FLOOR\n\n               Where firemen are scurrying around, suiting up. Brian looks \n               frantically for Stephen, sees him out back.\n\n               EXT.

There, watching \n               him, watching the whole exchange between brothers, is Adcox.\n\n               Adcox stares at Brian a beat, then finally disappears as \n               Brian hears the cough of diesel engines.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Oh, Christ.

Adcox climbs aboard just as the engine \n               company pulls out and whistles down the street.\n\n               The ladder company is just easing onto the drive. Brian \n               hesitates only an instant, then runs to the equipment racks, \n               PULLS off the hooks his helmet, coat, boots -- and jumps \n               onto the truck as it takes off in pursuit.\n\n               INT./EXT. ENGINE COMPANY 17 - NIGHT\n\n               As it howls down the avenue, Stephen turns around and stares \n               at Adcox sitting behind. The glimmer of an understanding...\n\n               INT./EXT. TRUCK COMPANY 46 - NIGHT\n\n               The laddermen look confused seeing Brian sitting among them.\n\n               A CAR Suddenly CUTS the truck company off. The driver SLAMS \n               the brakes, PUSHING the truck company into a HORRIBLE SKID. \n               The back fishtails, the wheels JUMP the curb, BASH a mailbox, \n               and then the whole rig ROLLS onto its side and DRAGS to a \n               stop.\n\n               It's tangled confusion in the rear cab. Firemen, unhurt, \n               piled atop one another. Brian slides his way out from under \n               them and looks down the street where plumes of smoke rise \n               six blocks away.\n\n               He starts running.\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE FIRE - NIGHT\n\n               Flames and smoke curl from a huge industrial warehouse along \n               the river as Brian, panting, runs up. He searches frantically \n               through the maze of arriving engine companies, looking for \n               number 17. There it is but nobody's home. Brian stops a \n               passing captain.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Where are they?

WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Brian, now fully suited up, climbs the endless rungs of an \n               extended aerial ladder.\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT\n\n               Tongues of flame ROCKET skyward through ragged holes. Black \n               clouds drift murderously, roofing tars bubble and hiss as \n               the roof itself GROANS like a comatose dinosaur, reminding \n               you the whole thing could go any minute -- and you with it.\n\n               Trudging alone across this alien, spongy surface, Brian looks \n               for his company. It's almost impossible to tell anyone apart, \n               faces hidden behind helmets and masks.\n\n               Suddenly a cloud of smoke clears and there's two firemen \n               near the edge, \"17\" on their helmets.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Stephen --\n\n               The helmets look up.

They're the only three \n               people on earth.\n\n               Adcox's eyes are clouded with tears.\n\n                                     AXE\n                         Aw man, Stephen, listen to me...\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         -- What the fuck were you thinking, \n                         huh?

AL - NIGHT\n\n               Brian, Stephen and Adcox react as the roof HOWLS and GROANS \n               and huge SPLITS begin racing along it. And then it goes.\n\n               The center section DROPS, and in rolling waves of SCREECHING \n               steel, the hole spreads outward; DEVOURING.\n\n               Adcox shoves them aside and runs for his life as the hole \n               races for them, SWALLOWING roof.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Jesus Christ Brian, run! Run goddamn \n                         it!\n\n               And Brian balls-out dashes for the edge. Stephen's made one \n               corner, Brian desperately heads for another. At the last \n               instant -- as the HOWLING FLAME BELLOWS UP to his ankles -- \n               Brian LEAPS OFF the roof --\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT\n\n               -- And falls half a story before CRASHING onto an exterior \n               fire escape. Flames have cut off the fire escape two floors \n               below, so Brian climbs down as far as possible, crawls onto \n               a ledge, KICKS out a window, steps through,\n\n               And falls.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT\n\n               Blackness and emptiness, two stories of it, before he CRASHES \n               into a pool of water at the bottom. He's in a freight elevator \n               shaft, thrashing madly, drowning. Great SHEETS of WATER are \n               POURING through an upper doorway and CASCADING down like \n               monsoon rain.\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE - FIREBOAT\n\n               We see it's coming from the fireboat's rushing stream.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n               The weight of his equipment is pulling Brian underwater. \n               Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water \n               still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans \n               back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His \n               coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He \n               struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.\n\n               The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster \n               CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The \n               place is coming apart.\n\n               Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main, \n               SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS \n               from one side of the shaft to the other.\n\n               Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.\n\n               Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but \n               his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat \n               becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under \n               water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to \n               drown or burn --\n\n               -- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the \n               shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A \n               flashlight.\n\n               It's Stephen.\n\n               Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees \n               the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite. \n               It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal \n               curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that, \n               Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He \n               SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS \n               CRASHING into the pool beside Brian.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't \n                         you stay behind a desk where you \n                         belong?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         \"You never know till the fire stares \n                         you down if you're gonna be --\"\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Oh shut up, huh?\n                              (grimaces)\n                         I think I broke my goddamn arm...\n\n               Brian helps him stay above water. The level continues to \n               rise, bringing them finally even with an open doorway they \n               scramble through.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n\n               It leads to a stairwell that's become a RAGING TORRENT of \n               water spilling down it. No way. They push through to the \n               next doorway and out onto\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The place is full of hundreds of chemical drums. The fire \n               has cracked its way into the room as WUMP -- drums begin \n               EXPLODING, SHOOTING UPWARD Roman candle fountains of \n               glittering FLAME. Brian helps Stephen as they snake their \n               way past sweating drums -- pressure valves hissing madly \n               with desperation. They duck low, round a corner,\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT\n\n               -- And walk right into an axe handle that SMACKS Brian's \n               throat KNOCKING him gasping flat on his back. It's Adcox.\n\n               Stephen JUMPS Adcox and TACKLES him on the edge of a metal \n               platform that extends out from the raised flooring.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You stupid son of a bitch!

Goddamn it let it go!\n\n               And Adcox releases the axe.\n\n                                     AXE\n                         I'm sorry... I'm so sorry...\n\n               Brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical \n               drum below EXPLODES, the shock wave BUCKLING the platform \n               and DROPPING it several feet before it HOLDS. Brian, cut-\n               off, is HIT with a wall of debris.\n\n               Adcox and Stephen are FLUNG across the platform and THROUGH \n               the shattered railing. Stephen grabs a piece of broken, \n               dangling strut and hangs on with one hand.\n\n               In his other hand is Adcox. Hanging below him, his grip \n               loosening.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Stephen!\n\n               Brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. The \n               railing Stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand SLIPPING \n               along it. But he won't let go of Adcox. His eyes bore into \n               his best friend's with absolute conviction.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         You go, we go.\n\n               The towering shots of FLAME from below have begun to IGNITE \n               Adcox's pant leg. He's starting to burn. But Stephen won't \n               let go. Won't let go even as the flames crawl up Adcox's \n               back. And Stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then \n               it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         NO!\n\n               Adcox and Stephen FALL. There's a narrow catwalk half-way \n               down. Stephen HITS with a sickening CRUNCH.\n\n               Adcox falls past it, down into the flames.\n\n               There's an exposed I-beam running from the ruined platform \n               out over the catwalk. Brian climbs up onto it, balances across \n               over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his \n               brother lies, battered but still alive.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         You're gonna be all right, man.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - FLOOR - NIGHT\n\n               Brian looks down and across the factory floor. There, coming \n               through the doorway, is Pengelly and Nightengale with a \n               hoseline.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Hey! Over here!\n\n               They start for him when another drum EXPLODES, FLATTENING \n               them and launching their hoseline into a crazy, thrashing \n               arc. The flame has cut them off from the hose. Stephen sees \n               what Brian's thinking.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Wait for another hose team...\n\n               But Brian's already moving for the catwalk ladder.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Wait for the goddamn hose team!\n\n               Brian puts his feet on the outside rungs of the ladder and \n               SLIDES down to the factory floor. He's heading for the \n               hoseline when WHAM! -- The fire cuts him off. Not just any \n               fire. That same one from so many years ago.\n\n               Don't fuck with me, kid. I'm not in the mood.\n\n               Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames \n               spinning slowly upside down -- just like his father's. Brian \n               stands there, paralyzed, as the fire laughs at him. Same old \n               little kid with his finger up his ass. Then something \n               different comes into Brian's eyes.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         No... No more.\n\n               There's a pathetic little wall extinguisher mounted on the \n               pole. Brian lifts it, approaches the fire. You can practically \n               hear the flames laugh at him. Brian suddenly turns and SLAMS \n               the neck of the extinguisher against the pole, BREAKING it \n               off before HEAVING the cannister HISSING into the flames \n               where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that \n               STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through \n               and TACKLE the hose.\n\n               The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as \n               Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.\n\n               -- And it's like a howling train wreck as the two grapple \n               with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening, \n               and they're dashing for the catwalk ladder up to Stephen \n               because the fire doesn't care -- it only has eyes for Brian \n               now --\n\n               -- And Stephen sees Brian tackle the monster, and his eyes \n               fill with tears --\n\n               -- And the fire's pushing Brian -- pushing him with the fury \n               of a frightened street bully -- but Brian won't give -- and \n               now the fire's back's broken -- it's whimpering, dying.\n\n               And Pengelly and Nightengale have climbed up to Stephen now, \n               pulling him away.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         That's my brother! That's my brother \n                         goddamn it!\n\n               And the fire's just a little gremlin now, sighing sadly as \n               Brian steps up with the hoseline.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Another time, friend.\n\n               And whoosh, it's gone.\n\n               EXT.
