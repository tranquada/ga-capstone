The red light \n               snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down \n               the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last \n               instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older \n               brother.\n\n               They stick their tongues out.\n\n<b>               EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n</b>\n               The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched \n               between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at \n               intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on \n               sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency \n               lights bouncing crazily off shop windows.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping \n               off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and \n               pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his \n               son.\n\n<b>                                     DENNIS\n</b>                         Stay near the truck.\n                              (winks)\n                         And keep an eye out for us, huh? \n                         We're short handed today.\n\n               Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis \n               smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward \n               a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the \n               cab.\n\n<b>                                     ENGINEER\n</b>                         Don't stray too far, little man.\n\n               Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better \n               look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking \n               on purpose.\n\n<b>               EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER\n</b>\n               There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian \n               watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox \n               onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window \n               over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.\n\n               Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed \n               with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony. \n               A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out \n               the frame with his axe, and dives in.\n\n               A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, \n               smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing \n               to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a \n               ladder.\n\n               Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than \n               life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between \n               fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling \n               darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, \n               he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing \n               a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. \n               The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh, \n               don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head \n               staring up in astonishment.\n\n               Nobody else has noticed it.\n\n               Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window; \n               probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian \n               starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,\n\n<b>                                     BRIAN\n</b>                         Dad...\n\n               He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is \n               happening very fast in slow motion:\n\n               -- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole \n               as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that \n               beckons him as -- \n\n               Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him \n               clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling \n               fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT \n               and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm \n               that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood, \n               and something metal that cracks against the pavement and \n               spins slowly.\n\n               A fire helmet.\n\n               And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, \n               hopeless tears streaming down his face.\n\n<b>                                     AXE\n</b>                         Get us some backup! We need some \n                         goddamn backup!\n\n               And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet \n               spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is \n               raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to \n               its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at \n               the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we \n               read the printing on the neck guard.\n\n<b>               MCCAFFREY\n</b>\n               And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, \n               protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian \n               doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his \n               father's helmet, And puts it on.\n\n               The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures \n               the instant.\n\n<b>               INT.

There's \n                         two cops outside that want to ask \n                         you about this --\n\n               Rimgale drops the manning report on Swayzak's desk.\n\n<b>                                     SHADOW\n</b>                         This is just a guess of course, but \n                         I think they're gonna want to know \n                         why you secretly paid Donald Cosgrove, \n                         Jeffrey Holcomb and Alan Seagrave to \n                         create a phony manpower study.\n                              (to cameras)\n                         You guys'll wait, right?\n\n               The room explodes with questions. Through the din Brian leans \n               over the desk very close to Swayzak.\n\n<b>                                     BRIAN\n</b>                         See that glow flashing in the corner \n                         of your eye? That's your career \n                         dissipation light. And it just went \n                         into high gear.\n\n               Brian turns and pushes his way out. At the door he pauses \n               and looks back at Rimgale. The investigator nods and smiles \n               just a little...\n\n<b>               INT.

It's gone now.\n\n               And there's just a beat between the investigator and his \n               probie before Brian nods and walks away.\n\n<b>               EXT.
