Hurting my mother\r\n           was a mistake and I hate myself for\r\n           it, and I hate my illness and I\r\n           want to control it. My father, on\r\n           the other hand, had no trouble\r\n           slapping the shit out of me last\r\n           night, which I did not return\r\n           `cause I could've killed him and I\r\n           didn't.

Okay?\r\n           And I think he probably just tried\r\n           to do his best.\r\n\r\n           DR. PATEL\r\n           Pat, you have to have a strategy. I\r\n           told you earlier. You need to\r\n           recognize these feelings coming to\r\n           you, otherwise you will be sent\r\n           back to Baltimore.

And she still wears her\r\n          wedding ring. So she's a loyal,\r\n          married-to-a-dead-guy slut.\r\n\r\n           DR.

This \"crazy sad\r\n           shit,\" as you call it, made you a\r\n           happier, calmer person with a\r\n           beautiful positive philosophy of\r\n           going outdoors, working out, and\r\n           reading books.\r\n\r\n                          PAT\r\n           No, not the books.\r\n\r\n           DR.

So if\r\n           you become friends with Tiffany,\r\n           Nikki will think that you're a\r\n           kind, generous, large-hearted\r\n           person, who helps people in need,\r\n           who is basically thriving.

Otherwise I find myself\r\n           thinking that we might both be\r\n           better off moving on with our lives\r\n           separately.
