BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN\n\n          22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep\n          as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and\n          plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure\n          sleeping bliss, she wills herself up.\n          She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a \"Hang in\n          there, baby\" poster and into the bathroom.\n\n          INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER\n\n          Stephanie turns on the shower. While waiting for the water to\n          heat up, she looks into the mirror and with exaggerated\n          pronunciation, recites:\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          There is no friction, with proper\n          diction. Good sounds abound, when\n          the mouth is round.\n          She catches herself on the last word, a hint of \"Missouri\n          twang\" slipping through.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Round.\n          Yawn. She slips off her nightgown and lumbers into the\n          steaming shower.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING\n\n          She opens the refrigerator: A half grapefruit sits next to an\n          inviting slice of chocolate cake. She's tempted, but chooses\n          the grapefruit.\n\n          EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD PARKING STRUCTURE - MORNING\n\n          A sunny Southern California day. Commuters speed by.\n          Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE,\n          across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from\n          the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward\n          the intersection. The traffic signal changes to \"Don't Walk\".\n          A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street.\n          Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign. She\n          looks down to see a little KITTEN. It rubs against her ankles\n          and PURRS.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Well, you're a little cutie.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n          A car's HORN blares, spooking the kitten. It darts into the\n          intersection and freezes at the sight of an oncoming VAN.\n          Stephanie races into the intersection, snatches up the kitten\n          and places it safely down on the other side of the street.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Hey! Slow down!\n          The Van roars past. She pets the Kitten. It PURRS and licks\n          Stephanie's face. She sets it down.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Go on home. Shoo now!\n          She heads for the Bank. The kitten follows. She turns back,\n          frowning.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Shoo!\n\n          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA -- DAY\n\n          Stephanie site at her desk, across from a young MEXICAN\n          COUPLE. She studies their mortgage. application.\n\n          MEXICAN MAN\n          We keep getting the same thing.\n          Because I'm not employed by an\n          American company, they won't take\n          my application until they get my\n          solvency statement. And the Mexican\n          Treasury Department says that's\n          going to take at least four more\n          weeks.\n\n          MEXICAN WOMAN\n          And the house will be gone by then.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It says, here your employed by\n          Pemex?\n\n          MEXICAN\n          That's right.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Isn't Pemex a subsidiary of Union\n          Oil?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n          a MEXICAN MAN\n           Yes. So? 0\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          So technically, your employer is an\n          American company. I think we can\n          make this work. I'll call you this\n          afternoon and let you know.\n          The happy couple shake Stephanie's hand and exit. ELLEN,\n          Stephanie's pretty, twenty two year old, roommate, flops down\n          into the seat across from her.\n\n          ELLEN\n          I need clarification on the shoe\n          issue.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Okay...\n\n          ELLEN\n          First of all-- you know you've got\n          the only perfect pair of black\n          dress shoes in L.A. So was that a\n          definite, irrevocable, \"no way\" or\n          t just a rather not at this time, \"no \n          way\"?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It's an absolutely, positively,\n          forget about the shoes already, \"no\n          way\". They're my only good pair and\n          I need them in good shape for\n          tomorrow.\n\n          ELLEN\n          What's Up?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Dinner with Ray's parents.\n          Ellen picks up a desktop photo: A shot of Stephanie and her\n          handsome boyfriend, Ray, locked in an embrace, standing in\n          the spray of a waterfall.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Ray's got a nice butt. Really tight\n\n          AND---\n          Stephanie takes back her photo.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          1 --I know. Thanks.\n\n          ELLEN\n          He's a keeper. But I told you about\n          his mom, she's another story. I\n          used to waitress at her country\n          club, and with her, it's all about\n          what private school you went to and\n          who you know. You still up for that\n          promotion? That would help.\n          Stephanie looks longingly to...\n\n          THE VACANT OFFICE\n          of the former Assistant Manager. The large oak desk. The\n          executive chair. Waiting to be filled.\n          Stephanie turns back, pushing the thought away.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I'm not putting on a show. She'll\n          either accept me for who I am or\n          not.\n\n          4\n\n          ELLEN\n          Are you reading self help books\n          again?\n          The Kitten peers out through Stephanie's partially opened\n          desk drawer.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Hello there!\n          Ellen reaches for the Kitty but Stephanie waves her off.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          --Shhhl I can't let my boss see\n          him.\n          Stephanie glances to her manager, MR. JACKS, a heavyset man\n          sitting behind a large desk.\n\n          ELLEN\n          What about the shoes?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I told you. No. Now beat it.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n          Mr. Jacks sneezes, rubs his nose. He looks suspiciously about\n          the bank for the source of his allergy. 0\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Uh Oh. You better bring the kitty\n          home for me.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Sure. If I can take the shoes.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I told you, no.\n          Mr. Jacks sneezes again, his eyes water. He turns to his\n\n          SECRETARY.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Has someone brought a damned animal\n          into my bank?!\n          Mr. Jacks looks about the Bank, his twitching nose leading\n          him toward Stephanie's desk.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Okay, fine! Take the shoes!\n\n          \n          Hidden from Mr. Jack's view, Ellen quickly scoops up the\n          Kitten and places it into her purse.\n          As Mr. Jacks arrives at Stephanie's desk, he overhears:\n\n          ELLEN\n          Just don't expect me to take care\n          of it.\n          This catches Mr. Jack's Attention. He turns to the ladies,\n          wondering what they're talking about. Stephanie takes Ellen's\n          hand and vigorously shakes it goodbye.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Of course not. I'll take care of\n          everything. And thanks for choosing\n          Bank of California.\n          Ellen plays along.\n\n          T\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Okay. Then I'll see you later. I\n          mean--- whenever the next time I'm\n          in the bank. You know-- for a loan.\n\n          OR--\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Goodbye.\n          As Ellen passes, Mr. Jacks sneezes again, harder.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Someone has definitely brought an\n          animal in here.\n          He eyes Ellen suspiciously as she exits.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I don't see any cats. Or any\n          animals.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Hope to hell, not.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          By the way, I put the paperwork for\n          the Mcpherson loan on your desk.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Mcpherson?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          That big corporate loan I've been\n          trying to set up? It's just\n          preliminary but--\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Oh, right. I'll look it over when I\n          get the chance.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Mr. Jacks, I was wondering it you\n          had made any decision regarding the\n          Assistant Manager's position yet?\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          I'm still deciding. Right now it's\n          between Stu and yourself.\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          7.\n\n          STEPHANIE \n          Stu? The trainee?\n          Stephanie turns to see Stu, the balding loan officer who sits\n          at his desk, watching, trying to figure out what Jacks is\n          saying to her.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          I know he's new but he's also quite\n          aggressive and we like that. Don't\n          get me wrong, you're well liked\n          here, but we're also looking for\n          someone who's not afraid to crunch\n          the numbers and make the tough\n          decisions.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Mr. Jacks, I feel that I'm\n          perfectly capable of--\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          --I'll let you know as soon as,I\n          decide. In the meantime, take him\n          through our loan qualifying\n          procedures... just in case.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Oh. okay.\n\n          MR JACKS\n          And would you mind taking your\n          lunch now?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Sure.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          And on your way back, maybe you\n          could bring me a turkey club?\n          Stu overhears them as he passes by.\n\n          STU\n          Turkey club. Excellent choice, J.J.\n          Then to Stephanie:\n\n          STU\n          Mind picking one up for me?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          8.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No problem.\n          Jacks heads back toward his desk. Stephanie grabs her purse\n          and keys and as she heads out, Stu calls after her:\n\n          STU\n          On toasted rye! And spicy mustard!\n          Stephanie doesn't like fetching lunch for the trainee but\n          hides her displeasure.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Sure.\n\n          EXT. UCLA - WESTWOOD CAMPUS - DAY\n\n          Stephanie enters the Ivy-covered red bricked Department of\n          Psychology Building.\n\n          INT. UCLA LECTURE HALL - DAY\n\n          RAY DALTON, a handsome twenty-nine year old man is lecturing\n          before a class of UCLA students. They listen attentively.\n\n          RAY\n          The conscious mind abhors\n          uncertainty. It seeks a pattern or\n          reason for everything. When we\n          can't find that pattern or reason,\n          we sometimes ascribe it's cause to\n          the world of the supernatural. The\n          spiritual world is created by the\n          human mind to conveniently explain\n          everything we can't. So when does a\n          belief in the supernatural cross\n          into the field of abnormal\n          behavior? Where do you, the\n          Psychologist, come in? When these\n          beliefs negatively affect our\n          patients activities of daily\n          living. Their jobs, their friends,\n          their sense of well being--\n          The class bell RINGS.\n\n          RAY\n          Tomorrow we'll be covering the\n          clinical manifestations of\n          psychosis. You'll find it all\n          t referenced in the text.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          9.\n          The students pack up their books. Ray smiles as he sees\n          Stephanie enter the lecture hall, holding a bag of deli food.\n\n          INT. RAY'S UNIVERSITY OFFICE - LATER\n\n          Stephanie eats a salad as she goes over a financial statement\n          of the Mcpherson Corporation.\n          Ray grades papers.\n\n          RAY\n          How're things at the bank? How's\n          that new position looking?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I don't know.\n\n          RAY\n          Really? You sounded so sure.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Well, now there's this new guy...\n          they're considering him too.\n          Ray sees how bummed out she is. He moves close, taking her in \n          his arms.\n\n          RAY\n          That job needs somebody with your\n          experience. They know that.\n          Stephanie nods.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Oh, I've got something for you.\n          She rummages through her purse and hands Ray an envelope. He\n          removes a coin. An old nickle.\n\n          RAY\n          A 1925 Indian head! Hey, good find.\n          Where'd you get it?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          One of the tellers found it for me.\n          Ray puts the coin back into the envelope and tucks it into\n          his pocket.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          10.\n\n          RAY\n          Thanks.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I'd better get back to work.\n          She quickly gathers her things. Ray returns to grading his\n          student's exams. The telephone RINGS. Ray hits the\n          speakerphone.\n\n          RAY.\n          Doctor Dalton.\n          It's the voice of an older woman, TRUDY.\n\n          TRUDY ON SPEAKERPHONE\n          Hello dear.\n\n          RAY\n          Hi Mom, can you hold on a sec?\n          He turns from the phone, whispering to Stephanie:\n\n          RAY\n          I'll call you tonight.\n          She kisses Ray and exits.\n\n          INT. HALL OUTSIDE RAY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Stephanie stops at the water fountain for a drink.\n\n          RAY'S VOICE\n          Nothing much. Just had lunch with\n          Stephanie. And trying to get these\n          midterms graded--\n          She halts as she hears her name mentioned on Ray's\n          speakerphone. She moves closer to Ray's office to eavesdrop:\n\n          TRUDY'S VOICE\n          --Stephanie? The one from the farm?\n\n          RAY'S VOICE\n          You know who she is.

Okay? Bye.\n          A downhearted Stephanie quietly exits.\n\n          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - BREAK ROOM - DAY\n\n          As Stephanie pours herself a cup of coffee, Stu and Mr. Jacks\n          take the first bites of their sandwiches. Stu makes a face.\n          He inspects the sandwich, shakes his head.\n\n          STU\n          (quietly to Mr. Jacks)\n          She messed up my order.\n          Stephanie heard that.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No I didn't, Stu.\n\n          STU\n          Steph, I said \"no mayo\".\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          You never said that.\n          Stu rolls his eyes to Mr. Jacks.\n          Stephanie caught Stu's look, but what can she do? She\n          exits.\n\n          INT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - LATER\n\n          Stephanie sits at her desk, entering data into her computer.\n          She glances across the bank to see Stu and Mr. Jacks emerging\n          from the break room. Stu is about to return to his desk when\n          he remembers something: he's got two tickets to a Dodger game\n          that he can't use. Mr. Jacks happily accepts the tickets.\n          Stephanie looks to the vacant office of the Assistant\n          Manager. She can feel her promotion slipping away.\n\n          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...\n          Stephanie looks to the source of the sound...\n          A withered hand. An involuntary tremor causes it's yellowed\n          fingernails to SCRATCH across the surface of Stephanie's\n          desk...\n\n          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...\n          The hand belongs to MRS. SYLVIA GANUSH, the aged woman who\n          site across from Stephanie. She wears a.formal dress and hat\n          from another era. The outfit is threadbare in spots but great\n          care has been taken to maintain it.\n\n          MRS.

What can I do for you?\n          Mrs. Ganush coughs up phlegm and spits it into a linen\n          handkerchief, which she tucks back into her puree. She hands\n          Stephanie a bunch of crumpled papers. Stephanie reviews them.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Mrs. \"Ganush\"?\n          The old woman nods.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          This is a delinquency notice... it\n          says that the payment on your loan\n          was due a number of months ago. And\n          this other document... is a court\n          order for repossession.

The Old Woman picks through a\n          bowl of hard candies on Stephanie's desk.\n          Stephanie stands before Mr. Jacks. He acknowledges her\n          without looking up from his work.\n\n          1B\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n\n          MR.

They're in the process of\n          repossessing her home. She's on a\n          fixed income and she's had some\n          medical problems. I was wondering\n          if we could give her a break.\n          Stephanie hands Mr. Jacks the loan file. He puts on his\n          bifocals, studies it.\n          Stephanie glances over her shoulder.\n\n          STEPHANIE'S P.O.V. - HER DESK\n          Mrs. Ganush looks around to. make sure no one's watching, then\n          tips the bowl of hard candies into her purse. She reaches.\n          into her mouth and removes a set of stained dentures that she\n          wraps in her linen handkerchief.\n          She places a piece of hard candy into her mouth and gums it\n          with a wet SUCKING sound. The Old Woman's one good eye,\n          wanders about in ecstacy as she sucks on the sugary treat.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Apparently, we've already granted\n          her two extensions. And you know\n          on this type of foreclosure, the\n          bank makes a sizable amount in\n          fees.\n          He hands her back the file.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It would mean I'd have to throw her\n          out of her house.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          Tough decision. Your call.\n          He leans back in his overstuffed leather chair and studies\n          her. Stephanie glances to the vacant office of the Assistant\n          Manager. The large oak desk. The thick carpet.\n          She sees a calculating Stu Rubin eyeing her from his\n          workstation.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I'll take care of it. \n          Stephanie returns to her desk.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Mrs. Ganush, another extension on\n          the loan is out of the question.\n\n          MRS.

GANUSH\n          But where will I live?\n\n          \n          Stephanie leafs through the loan documents. She finds a name.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Mrs. Ganush, you've given your\n          granddaughter as a reference... It\n          says here, she lives nearby...\n          Wouldn't you be better off living\n          with her?\n\n          MRS.

I'm really\n          sorry Mrs. Ganush.\n          Stephanie takes the loan documents and places them neatly\n          into a manila folder. she glances up but Mrs. Ganush is gone..\n          Stephanie turns in her chair and is startled to see the old\n          woman, kneeling before her. She clutches Stephanie's leg with\n          her gnarled hands.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          Have mercy on me.\n          Stephanie stands, tries to pull free, but the old woman will\n          not release her leg.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Please, let go.\n          Customers turn to look. Mr. Jacks glances up from his desk.\n\n          MR. JACKS\n          What the hell?\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.

GANUSH\n          You shame me.\n          She composes herself. Then, slowly stands, puffing up her\n          chest. Mu3tering her damaged pride.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          I begged you...\n          Her one. good eye fixes it's hardened gaze upon Stephanie.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          .and you shame me.\n          Mrs. Ganush suddenly grasps Stephanie's arm. Stephanie tries\n          to pull away but the old lady's grip is strong. Mrs. Ganush\n          reaches out to pluck the charm bracelet from Stephanie's\n          wrist-- but the Security Guard intervenes.\n\n          SECURITY GUARD\n          I think your business here is\n          finished, ma'am.\n          The Guard escorts Mrs. Ganush from the bank. Through the\n          banks's window, Stephanie watches the Guard lead Mrs. Ganush\n          to a old, Chevy Cavalier on the street.\n          Stephanie composes herself and when she again looks up, the\n          old woman's car is gone.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          INT. BANK - LATER\n\n          16 The bank is closing. Stephanie is finishing some paper work\n           when Mr. Jacks stops by her desk. 0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18.\n\n          MR.

And by\n          the way, as far as the Assistant\n          Manager's position... You're at the\n          top of the list.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Thanks.\n          Mr. Jacks nods, heads for home. Stephanie loads a pile of\n          contracts, a ruler and a desk stapler into a cardboard box\n          and exits the bank. The Security guard locks up behind her.\n\n          EXT. BANK OF CALIFORNIA - PARKING STRUCTURE - DAY\n\n          Stephanie waves as the last of her co-workers drive off. It's\n          then that she notices the battered Chevy Caviler. It's parked\n          in the structure.\n          Stephanie looks closer. There's no one behind the wheel.\n          She nervously glances about. No sign of Mrs. Ganush.\n          Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car.\n          Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly\n          than she would like.\n          She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the\n          doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat\n          next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange\n          sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the\n          lot.\n          It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief.\n          It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer.\n          Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her\n          car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps\n          up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is\n          carried off by the wind.\n          Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled\n          hands come up around her face! Mrs Ganush sits up in the\n          back seat of her car! SHRIEKING with rage at Stephanie!\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          19.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH \n          (In Hungarian)\n          You bitch! I pluck out your fucking\n          eyes!\n          Mrs. Ganush's razor sharp fingernails lash out towards\n          Stephanie's eyes. But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists,\n          halting her.\n          The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's\n          throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically\n          searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat\n          next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and\n          jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her\n          grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before\n          Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old\n          woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over\n          the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back\n          of the front seat to pull even harder... Stephanie's neck is\n          now bent so far back it's about to snap!\n          Stephanie's hand finds the stapler, trips the release. It\n          springs open. She swings it back over her shoulder!\n          Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk! Ka-Thunk!\n          With each blow, she delivers a staple into Mrs. Ganush's\n          forehead.\n          Ka-Thunk! A lucky shot-- the old lady's white eye is stapled\n          shut.\n          The old woman HOWLS, but her grip on Stephanie's hair only\n          tightens.\n          Stephanie, about to black out, throws the car into gear and\n          hits the gas. As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her\n          shoulder harness with the last of her strength.\n          The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her\n          to see... an oncoming concrete column.\n          Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her\n          shoulder harness.\n          But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat,\n          impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force.\n          Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash. In\n          a spray of broken teeth, her dentures eject from her mouth.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          20.\n          Both women are dazed from the impact. Stephanie regains her\n          wits first. She reaches across Mrs. Ganush and opens the\n          passenger door.\n          Mrs. Ganush stirs, but before she can come to, Stephanie's\n          foot shoves her out. The old woman hits the ground hard but\n          she sits up suddenly with a SNARL and starts to climb back\n          in. Stephanie shifts the car into reverse. The opened\n          passenger door knocks Mrs. Ganush back down to the pavement.\n          The car's rear bumper slams into a concrete column. Stephanie\n          is dazed.\n          Mrs. Ganush crawls to her feet and begins limping toward the\n          car.\n          Stephanie tries to focus. A blurred image in the rear view\n          mirror: Mrs. Ganush running closer,'SHRIEKING with old world\n          rage!\n          The Old Woman reaches for the opened passenger door but\n          Stephanie closes it and locks it just in time! Mrs. Ganush\n          furiously pulls on the door handle to no,avail.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I beat you, you old bitch! Next\n          time take your Geretol!\n          The old woman bends down, beneath Stephanie's view. Stephanie\n          looks about. Where'd she go?\n          The old woman pops up into view, raising a chunk of concrete\n          and... CRASHI Stephanie SCREAMS as the window shatters.\n          The old woman's head juts into the cart She clamps her\n          toothless maw down upon Stephanie.'s chin. Suckling it,\n          gumming. The old woman's good eye rolls about in ecstacy.\n          Stephanie SHRIEKS as she pushes the slobbering head away.\n          Strands of spittle form a bridge from the old woman's mouth\n          to Ste\n          phanie's jaw.\n          The old woman's wrinkled hands grope about the front seat.\n          She finds her dentures, now damaged from the fight. She\n          GRUNTS as she jams them back into her mouth. She comes at\n          Stephanie, mouth wide open and SHRIEKING!\n          Stephanie grabs the wooden ruler from her cardboard box and\n          shoves it down the old lady's throat. Mrs. Ganush gags,\n          trying to retch up the ruler.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          21.\n          Then Stephanie is suddenly screaming herself, as the old\n          1 Woman has grabbed her legs and is dragging her from the car.\n          Stephanie hits the pavement. She shields her face with her\n          hands, waiting, but the blow never comes. The old woman\n          standing above her, WHEEZING.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          You shamed me.\n          The Old Woman reaches down. Stephanie flinches. Mrs.'Ganush's\n          gnarled hand plucks a thin brass button from the sleeve of\n          Stephanie's coat. She waves the button through the air, and\n          breathes out a single word:\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          Lamia...\n          Clouds move past the setting Sun. A shadow falls over\n          Stephanie. A cold wind makes her shiver.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          What--? What are you doing?\n          Stephanie sits up, reaching for her button. But the old woman\n          1 moves it out of reach. \n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          You want it?\n          Stephanie snatches the button back. Mrs. Ganush smiles\n          cryptically as Stephanie stuffs the button into her coat\n          pocket.\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          Soon it will be you, who comes\n          begging to me. It begins tonight\n          when you hear the cry.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          What cry?\n\n          MRS. GANUSH\n          The Lamia. It's coming for you.\n          A large black, BUZZING fly lands on Stephanie's face. She\n          swats it away. Her vision blurs and she grows dizzy. She\n          leans against the car for support. When she finally looks up,\n          Mrs. Ganush is gone.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          22.\n\n          INT.

She shivers. He wraps his arms around her\n          protectively and after a moment, they walk on. Stephanie\n          watches wistfully as a YOUNG COUPLE coo over their BABY.\n          Behind the couple, Stephanie notices a neon sign in a\n          storefront window.

Isn't that a little\n          steep for this kind of thing?\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Then go. There are many who would\n          claim to be seers. But they are\n          not. Although you would pay them\n          little... you would receive\n          nothing.

The walls are lined\n          with old books. Rham Jas stands before Stephanie and Ray, who\n          sit at a card table. Stephanie giggles with excitement.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Sorry.\n          Rham Jas smiles back.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          25.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          That's quite all right. So, you\n          wish to know something of your\n          destiny. Very good. We shall see\n          what the fates have in store.\n          Rham Jas crosses to the window and closes the curtains.\n\n          RAY\n          Freud said destiny was not an act\n          of fate but rather something\n          created by our subconscious to\n          control our conscious choices.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          That is true. But... \"We should not\n          pretend to understand the world\n          only by intellect.\"\n\n          RAY\n          Carl Jung...\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Yes.

There's more to him than meets the eye.

Something's\n          been taken from you.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No, I-\n          Rham Jas grabs her arm and turns it, revealing the threads.\n          that once held the button on her coat sleeve.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          A button.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Well, yes!

The old woman...\n          the one I told you about... she\n          plucked the button right from my\n          sleeve.\n\n          RAY\n          Why would she do that?\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          If you would please, both be quiet.\n          Rham Jae concentrates, his eyelids flutter. Stephanie appears\n          uneasy. The flame of the candle begins to flicker as a breeze\n          sweeps through the room. The wind chimes TINKLE. Ray pulls\n          his collar closed against the sudden chill in the air. Rham\n          Jas's back stiffens.\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          27.\n          He releases Stephanie's hand and stands. He moves away from\n          the table, uncomfortable. With a handkerchief,' he dabs\n          perspiration from his brow.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          I think that is enough for now.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Wait. You saw something. What?\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          I'm sorry. I'm tired and I see it's\n          become quite late. Of course I will\n          refund your money.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Tell me.

C'mon, he's a scam\n          artist.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          He didn't want the money.

STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n          Stephanie site at the kitchen table in her flannel pajamas,\n          entering financial data into her laptop. An episode of\n          \"Desperate Housewives\" plays in the background on TV. A\n          baking timer CHIMES. Stephanie removes a beautifully browned\n          cake from the oven and sets it on the counter to cool. Her\n          roommate, ELLEN, comes down the stairs, snuggling the kitten.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Isn't he adorable?\n\n          ELLEN\n          Let's hope the landlord thinks so.\n          She sets down,the kitten and picks up her overnight bag. 0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          30.\n\n          ELLEN\n\n          T\n          What about you?

The wind kicks up, whisking leaves\n          about, as though something where moving up the path and\n          toward the front gate of the house.\n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n          An unsettling SHRIEK! what the hell was that? Stephanie sets\n          down the measuring cup.\n          She moves to the front door. Locks it.\n          She looks out the kitchen window. The iron. gate is now open.\n          It SHRIEKS as it swings back and forth in the wind.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          31.\n          Suddenly, the latch gives way and the windows swing open!\n          1 Wind sweeps through the kitchen, whipping dead leaves about.\n          The hanging pans bang together! KLANG! KLANG!\n          Stephanie forces the windows closed.\n          The wind dies. The room grows eerily quiet.\n          A car passes in the street below. It's headlights sweep\n          across the house. The headlight beams throw moving shadows on\n          the wall. Stephanie notices that one particular shadow is\n          darker than the others. It becomes the silhouette of Mrs.\n          Ganush, but there's no one in the room with her.\n          The car passes and the shadows vanish.\n          Sensing something, the Kitten arches it's back. Now Stephanie\n          feels it. A presence. The light bulb begins to sputter.\n          She holds her breath, listens.\n          The floorboards CREAK. Something is walking towards her. She\n          spins around, but there's nothing there. The SOUND of\n          footsteps drawing closer.\n          She backs against the wall, trembling.\n          Suddenly Stephanie's face is struck by an invisible hand! She\n          cries out. Her mouth is bleeding.\n          She runs for the door. She's almost there. Her hand reaches\n          for the knob, when something unseen picks her up. She SCREAMS\n          as she is thrown against the wall. She falls to the floor.\n          Lifting her head, she catches her own reflection in the\n\n          WINDOW:\n          In the reflection, as the light bulb flickers, we see a flash\n          of ghostly hands that grope at her body. They reach up\n          through the floor, and clutch at her legs, buttocks and\n          breasts.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Get off me! Get off!\n          The phantom hands vanish.

He looks up from the book,-\n          solemn.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          What did it sound like.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Like... shrieking. It was awful.\n          He nods. Closes the book.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          That would be the Lamia. The \"Black\n          Goat\".\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          43.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Lamia. Right. That's the word the \n          old woman used.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          It is a nasty spirit. A taker of\n          souls. A creature of misfortune for\n          you and those around you. It is\n          often summoned by the Gypsies for\n          their dour deeds. On the third day\n          the Lamia comes for the owner of\n          the accursed object.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Accursed object? What object?\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Something that the old woman took\n          from you, cursed, then gave back.\n          Now it dawns on Stephanie. She looks to the threads on her\n          coat.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          The button...\n\n          \n          Stephanie's hand slowly emerges from her coat pocket. The\n          thin brass button in her palm.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          .this?\n          She holds the button up for him to inspect. But it's presence\n          makes him uneasy..He wags his finger back and forth. She\n          lowers it.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          What if I just burn the thing?\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          No matter what condition the button\n          is in, you would still be the\n          owner. The Lamia would still come\n          to take you.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Take me where?\n\n          NO\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          44.\n          Rham Jas gives her a sad smile and closes the text. She\n          knows where. Stymied, she tucks the button back into her coat\n          pocket.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          There's got to be something I can\n          do.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Yes. There are many ways to appease\n          a spirit. The simplest is a blood\n          offering. An animal sacrifice. A\n          small creature would do. You could\n          sacrifice a chicken. It's all in\n          here...\n          Rham Jas produces a modern book on animal sacrifice which he\n          sets before her.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No way. I'm a vegetarian. I'm a\n          member of PETA, for Christ's sake.\n          I don't go around killing animals.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          You will be surprised what you will\n          be willing to do when the Lamia\n          comes for you.\n          She considers his words, looks down to the book.\n          CLOSE ON A DIAGRAM OF AN ANIMAL SACRIFICE - A creature's\n          heart being cut from it's body.\n          CAMERA pulls back to reveal that Stephanie now site at her\n          kitchen table, reading the book. We see other diagrams: The\n          heart being placed into a skillet over an open fire. The\n          burial of the smoking heart. Stephanie's kitten PURRS, as it\n          rubs against her leg.\n          Stephanie closes the book, shutting out the disturbing\n          images.\n          She hears the SHRIEK of the rusty gate outside. She moves to\n          the window and peers out. The rusting iron gate is open.\n          Stephanie senses a change in the room... Shadows shift and\n          grow deeper. The air is suddenly oppressive. Something is\n          coming.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          45.\n          She moves to the front door and puts her ear to it. Quiet.\n          1b But then--\n\n          SCRATCH... SCRATCH...\n          She runs upstairs into her bedroom and locks the door.\n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM\n\n          She can hear the sound of the SCRATCHING, even here.,\n          She rushes to the phone picks it up: No dial tone, only high\n          pitched static, the sounds of the Lamia buried within.\n          She sets the phone down.\n          For a moment all is quiet. Should she go back down? Then she\n          hears a tiny SQUEAKING. The knob on the front door, turning.\n          Then the CLICK of the lock, followed by the CREAKING of rusty\n          hinges as the front door swings open. She calls through her\n          bedroom door.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Ellen? !\n          But it's not Ellen. \n          Stephanie puts her,ear to the door. The sound of an animal's\n          hooves on wood. Something is climbing the stairs. It stops\n          outside her bedroom door.\n          Stephanie holds her breath, listening.\n          She sees a shadow beneath the crack in the door.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I know that you're there!\n          The window behind her explodes into the room with a deafening\n\n          ROAR!\n          She ducks for cover. Another window is blown inward and the\n          glass sent her way. She SCREAMS and runs toward the bathroom\n          door. It SLAMS shut in her face!\n          BOOM! Another window is SHATTERED by the angry, unseen thing.\n          The force knocks her to the bed. The blankets are torn from\n          the mattress, throwing Stephanie to the floor. The bedsheets\n          whisk around the room, flapping and twisting about like\n          1b drunken ghosts. \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          46.\n          She tries to run but they tangle around her legs and yank her\n          into the air, suspending her upside down, taking her on a\n          wild and harrowing ride about the room.\n          Abruptly all the madness halts: She drops to the floor. The\n          bedsheet wafts to the ground beside her. Whatever it was,\n          .it's gone. It's quiet now. A terrified Stephanie sits,\n          shaking, in the wreckage of her room.\n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - LATER\n\n          With a trembling hand, she jams a ZAGNUT BAR into her mouth,\n          and drops the wrapper onto a pile of others on the floor.\n          She chases it with a double shot of Maker's Mark Whiskey. She\n          removes a knife from the butcher block and hefts. it's weight.\n          She sings out, in a sweet but trembling voice.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Here kitty-kitty... Here, kitty-\n          kitty-kitty...\n          She moves closer until her face fills the screen.\n\n          EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n          The distant SCREAM of the kitten is heard. We hear it again\n          and again until it is finally silenced. 4\n\n          INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\n          Stephanie having been sick, emerges from the bathroom, wiping\n          her mouth.\n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN -DAY\n\n          Stephanie throws something small and bloody inside the\n          microwave oven and turns it on.\n\n          STEPHANIE'S BACKYARD GARDEN AFTERNOON\n          She buries the heart in a corner of her garden.\n          She turns on the garden hose, washing the cat's blood from\n          the knife.\n\n          ELLEN'S VOICE\n          Steph?\n          Stephanie quickly tosses the knife into the bushes. Ellen\n          appears.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          47.\n\n          ELLEN\n          t \n          Didn't you hear me calling?

Are you\n          power eating Clark bars again?\n          'Cause there's about ten thousand\n          wrappers all over the-- Oh my God,\n          is that blood?1\n          Stephanie glances guiltily to the corner of the garden. But\n          no blood shows.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No. Why would there be blood?\n\n          ELLEN\n          Right there, on your sleeve.\n          Stephanie glances at the red spot on her sleeve.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          That's just tomato juice. I was\n          inside making a salad and... I cut\n          a tomato and I must have gotten it\n          on my sleeve.\n          Ellen gives her roommate a worried look.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Look, Steph, we're friends so if\n          something's wrong...\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I had some problems. A situation.\n          But I think everything is going to\n          be good now.\n          Ellen isn't so sure.\n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n          Stephanie closes her bedroom door so Ellen can't see the\n          damage. Stephanie cleans up the place. As she picks up some\n          of her things, she comes across an old photograph.\n          CLOSER: It's a photo of 16 year old Stephanie. She was\n          obese. Her belly unflatteringly protrudes from beneath a \"4-\n          H\" tee shirt. She stands before some barnyard animals, a\n          bucket of feed in her hand.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          48.\n          Stephanie looks distastefully down at her former self. She\n          tears up the photo and dumps it in the waste basket.\n\n          INT. KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON\n\n          The music grows lighter as Stephanie models a couple of\n          dresses in front of Ellen, who's helping decide on the\n          evening's wardrobe.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Go with the short skirt.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          What about this one?\n          She hold up a longer, more formal dress.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Uh uh. That one's saying \"I'm\n          trying to impress you with my\n          conservative taste.\"\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          But that's what I want it to say.\n          Ellen shakes her head, no. Stephanie takes a last look in the\n          mirror, decides to go with the short skirt.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Okay. This is it.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Tell me again... the exact words he\n          used.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Just that this little cabin would\n          be a great place for us to really\n          connect and that there was\n          something he'd been meaning to talk\n          about with me.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Oh my god, you are so engaged!\n          Ellen's smile fades. She shakes her head despondently.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          What's wrong? I\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          49.\n\n          ELLEN\n          t \n          I just know that Rob's never going\n          to ask me.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          But I thought you said that\n          relationship was only physical.\n\n          ELLEN\n          Oh, I'd never marry a guy like\n          that... but I'd still like him to\n          ask me.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Huh.\n\n          EXT. NICHOLAS CANYON - DUSK\n\n          Stephanie's car pulling up in front of Ray's hillside house.\n          The convertible top is down and Stephanie looks radiant in\n          the golden sunlight.\n\n          RAY'S VOICE\n          Let's get a look at that dress.\n          She steps from the car and models the dress.

She smiles\n          at Ray and takes his hand.\n          She hits the gas and her Ford Focus opens up, accelerating\n          down a long, tree lined street, the wind blowing through\n          their hair.\n\n          EXT. DALTON HOUSE - DUSK\n\n          Stephanie and Ray approach the front door. Stephanie carries\n          her home made cake. They ring the bell.

I baked\n          something for you.\n          Trudy hesitates, then takes the cake from Stephanie.\n\n          TRUDY\n          It's lovely. Homemade.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It's a harvest cake.\n\n          \n\n          TRUDY\n          Harvest cake? Is'that some kind of\n          cake you make on a... farm?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          We used to, yeah, when you have a\n          lot of extra duck eggs. Especially\n          right before spring; that's when\n          you get a real dense yolk. Makes\n          for, rich cake.\n          The mother forces a smile.\n\n          TRUDY\n          You must give me the recipe\n          sometime.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Sure. It's easy. The real\n          secret's in the milk.

I mean\n          \"unpasteurized\"? Is that safe?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Uh huh. And you want that milk\n          still warm. Straight from the cow.\n          Trudy has to stifle her gag reflex. George returns and hands\n          Ray and Stephanie a cocktail.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Excuse me while I go find someplace\n          to put this.\n          As Trudy takes away the cake, a cat rounds the corner. It\n          HISSES at Stephanie. She takes a step back.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Never could understand that damned\n          animal. Hate cats.\n          Trudy returns from the kitchen.\n\n          TRUDY\n          That's strange. Hecuba's usually\n          very sweet.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          That's okay. I had a cat. I\n          understand.\n\n          RAY\n          What do you mean \"had a cat\"? What\n          happened to him?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          How would I know what happened?\n          Probably nothing. You know how cats\n          are.

So, how long have you been\n          working there, Stephanie?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Almost two years now.\n\n          TRUDY\n          The job of a bank teller must be so\n          difficult. I'd think with all the\n          counting and the repetition, it'd\n          become so tedious.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Yes, you're right. But I'm not a\n          teller.\n\n          \n\n          TRUDY\n          Oh?\n\n          RAY\n          Stephanie's a loan officer in\n          charge of small business and home\n          loans. And she's on a fast track\n          for a promotion. Right, Steph?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I'd like to think so... actually,\n          It depends. If I could close this\n          big account that I'm working on, it\n          would really help.\n\n          GEORGE\n          Must be a very important loan.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It would be the biggest that my\n          branch has ever handled.\n\n          GEORGE\n          How''d it come to you?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          54.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Well, I was reading the Wall Street\n          Journal and found this innovative\n          medical supply company that was\n          interested in expanding but didn't\n          have the liquidity. I met with\n          their CFO and presented a formula\n          for restructuring-some of their\n          long term debt. It created an\n          environment where I was able to\n          offer them a rather attractive loan\n\n          PACKAGE\n\n          GEORGE\n          You sure sound like you've got a\n          lot going for you, Stephanie.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Your mother must be very proud.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I suppose. I don't see her much.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Why is that?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Well, ever since my dad died she\n          doesn't talk much. She mostly stays\n          on the farm and... keeps to\n          herself. Because...\n          There is an awkward silence.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Does your mother have a drinking\n          problem?\n\n          RAY\n          Cut her some slack, mom, she--\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Yes. I'm afraid she does.\n\n          TRUDY\n          I'm sorry. It's nothing to be\n          ashamed of. And I find your honesty\n          refreshing.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Thank you.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.5 .\n\n          TRUDY\n          t \n          You've got back bone. Not like that\n          other girl Ray brought by... What\n          was her name? Alicia? She was\n          dreadful. So ill-mannered. And no\n          ambition.\n\n          RAY\n\n          MOM-\n\n          TRUDY\n          (stage whisper to\n\n          STEPHANIE)\n          He found her through the,internet.\n\n          RAY\n          Mors, please.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Stephanie, am I being too tough on\n          Ray?\n          Stephanie, happy to be taken into the family circle, winks at\n          Ray.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No. Not at all. That's what mom's\n          are for.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Thank you, Stephanie. Maybe I will\n          try that Harvest cake of yours,\n          after all.\n          Trudy cuts herself a piece. Stephanie tastes the cake and\n          emits a tiny cough.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Excuse me.\n          She clears her throat. But the cough returns, grows larger.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Just a little tickle in my--\n          She stands and takes a few steps away from the table. Ray\n          looks on concerned.\n\n          RAY\n          Are you okay?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          56.\n          She waves him off, clearing her throat. Tries to smile\n          demurely, but erupts with a harsh cough. She's choking on\n          something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her\n          throat. With all her might she emits a BARK and a large\n          black fly buzzes out of her mouth.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Oh! OH MY GOD!\n          The fly lazily BUZZES across the table, slowly circling\n          Trudy's head.\n          Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin.\n          George lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean\n          farm cake.\n          Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak.\n          Stephanie's gaze shifts to the kitchen door. From The other\n          side, she hears the sound of a hoofs.\n          Ray tries to cover for Stephanie:\n\n          RAY\n          I'm so sorry, Stephanie. I don't\n          know how that fly got. into your--\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          --Wait. What's that sound?\n\n          TRUDY\n          What sound-?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          SHHH! Listen!\n          Trudy listens along with the others. They can't hear\n          anything. But Stephanie hears the FOOTSTEPS drawing closer.\n\n          TRUDY\n          I'm sorry, I can't hear anything.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          (mutters under her breath)\n          Must be deafer than a post!\n          But Trudy heard that and takes offense. But before she can\n          say anything, a SHADOW appears at the base of the door.\n          Stephanie stands and shouts at it:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          57.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n\n          T\n          Leave me alone! Just leave me the\n          fuck alone!\n          Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past\n          Trudy's head. It shatters against the base of the door,\n          spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish. The\n          shadow and FOOTSTEPS are gone.\n          Ray rushes to her side.\n\n          RAY\n          Steph, it's okay! There's nothing\n          there.\n          She looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she\n          were mad.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I... I think I'd better go.\n\n          TRUDY\n          I think that's best, dear.\n          She heads for the door. Ray starts to go after her but his\n\n          \n          mother stops him.\n\n          TRUDY\n          Let her go, Ray. She's a sick girl.\n\n          RAY\n          She needs me.\n          Trudy grabs Ray's arm.\n\n          TRUDY\n          I'm telling you not to go after\n          her.\n          Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after\n          Stephanie.\n\n          EXT. DALTON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get\n          into her car.\n\n          RAY\n          What did you see in there?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          58.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n\n          4\n          You don't want to know.\n          Ray pulls her close.\n\n          RAY\n          Tell me!\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          The thing that's coming for me.\n          What the old woman sent.\n\n          RAY\n          Listen to me. What you're going\n          through right now-- It's like the\n          doctor said, it's a stress reaction\n          and --\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          No. I wanted to believe that-- but\n          it's real, Ray. You just don't want\n          to open your eyes to it because it\n          threatens you. Because if I'm right\n          and there is something out there,\n          then you'd have to throw out\n          everything you teach. And where'd\n          that leave you? Like a plow without\n          a mule.\n          Ray just stares at her. A long moment passes as he wonders if\n          maybe she isn't right.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Unless you're willing to take a\n          chance and believe in me, I can't\n          be with you any more.\n          She steps into the car and drives off. Ray watches her tail\n          lights, as they vanish into the night.\n\n          EXT. ECHO PARK HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n          An older home with bars on the front windows. Stephanie\n          knocks at the front door.\n          She turns toward a distant sound: A chilling, high-pitched\n          SQUEAL. Was it just a bus's air brakes... or something more?\n          When Stephanie turns back, the door has been opened a crack.\n          An EYE peers out at her.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          59.\n\n          VOICE OF THE EYE\n          What is it?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Hi. Yes. I came to see Sylvia\n          Ganush. Is she here?\n          The door opens wider, revealing a sexy twenty-four year old\n          Gypsy girl. ILENKA GANUSH. Bottle of beer in her hand, long\n          black hair, earrings and a snake tatoo on'her neck. She\n          wears a low cut shirt and tight shorts.\n          EASTERN EUROPEAN HIP HOP and LAUGHTER are heard from within\n          the house.\n\n          ILENKA\n          I'm Ilenka, Sylvia's granddaughter.\n          Who are you?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Stephanie Brown. I'm... sort of...\n          a friend of hers. Actually, I've\n          been trying to help her with a loan\n\n          THAT-\n\n          ILENKA\n          Wait. I know who you are. Grandma\n          told me you'd come. You're the\n          woman from the bank. The one who\n          took her house.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It was really the bank that took\n          the house. I just work there. In\n          fact, I tried to help your grandma\n          get-the house back, but my boss\n          wouldn't let me.\n          Ilenka knows she's lying. Stephanie knows that she knows.\n\n          ILENKA\n          That's not what happened, is it?\n          Are you going to stand here on my\n          porch and lie to my face?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          . no.\n\n          ILENKA\n          You used to be a real fat girl,\n          to didn't you?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          60.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Yes.\n\n          ILENKA\n          I can tell. You know, you caused my\n          grandma a lot of pain. That house\n          was her pride. When you took that\n          from her, she had nothing left.\n          You're not welcome here.\n          She starts to close the door. Stephanie halts her. Desperate\n          now, no where else to turn.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Okay! I did it. It was me who\n          denied her the loan. I was trying,\n          to get ahead at work and I\n          shouldn't have done it. It was\n          wrong.\n\n          ILENKA\n          Damn straight it was wrong.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          And I'm ashamed about it. And I'm\n          going to get down on my hands and\n          knees and beg her to forgive me.\n          She said-that I hadn't suffered\n          enough. But now I think she'll see\n          that I have and then maybe she'll\n          let me...\n\n          ILENKA\n          .make everything all right for\n          her, is that it?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Yes.\n          Ilenka gives a bitter, cryptic smile. She motions for\n          Stephanie to follow. They enter a room filled with young\n          Gypsies drinking, smoking and talking loudly in a Slavic\n          tongue.\n          A WOMAN WITH A CANE shouts as she throws a pair of dice. A\n          Hungarian man with a long, braided ponytail, curses his bad\n          luck as he pays cash to the woman.\n\n          ' STEPHANIE\n          Where is she?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          61.\n          Ilenka gestures to an area beyond the party goers.

She stumbles and falls atop \n          the Corpse of Mrs. Ganush!\n          As per the custom of the Gypsy wake, there is no coffin, just\n          her dead body that rests atop a coffee table.\n          Stephanie has landed atop the corpse! The leg of the coffee\n          table breaks under the weight of the two women. Stephanie\n          tumbles to the ground, the corpse landing atop her. The crowd\n          of mourners GASP.\n          The dead woman's opened mouth bobs up and down upon\n          Stephanie's chin, as through it were once again suckling it.\n          Stephanie shoves the corpse off of her and backs away in\n          revulsion.\n\n          ILENKA\n          Still going to make everything all\n          right?\n          The mourners replace the corpse atop the coffee table.\n          Ilenka addresses the crowd in Hungarian. She tells them that\n          it was this white trash farm girl that threw her grandmother\n          t from her home and that she now bears the curse of Lamia. \n          A mother shields her daughter's eyes from the sight of\n          Stephanie, the cursed one, then hurriedly kisses her\n          .crucifix.

But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a\n          post.

Then, out of.sync, the demonic voice is\n\n          HEARD:\n\n          SHAUN SAN DENA\n          (demonic voice)\n          The soul of Stephanie Brownl We\n          will feast upon it, as she festers\n          in the gravel\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          75.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          It was my manager, Jim Jacks. \n          He was the one !

Surely she's\n          not worthy of your greatness.\n          The possessed Shaun San Dena laughs.\n\n          SHAUN SAN DENA\n          (demonic voice)\n          No! I will enjoy watching her skin\n          blister and pop in hell's flame.

She attempts\n          t to force the spirit of the Lamia from her body and into the\n          goat. The Goat BLEATS and bucks wildly as the spirit is\n          transferred. Milos raises up the slaughtering blade.\n\n          SHAUN SAN DENA\n          (demonic voice)\n          No!

It's oval eye reflects the blade as it\n          descends toward it. The possessed Goat jerks aside and the\n          blade misses, slicing into the chair.\n          As Milos raises the blade for another blow, the goat bites\n          his hand. In that moment, the spirit of the Lamia is\n          transferred to him.\n          A Possessed Milos SCREAMS and spins toward Stephanie, glaring\n          at her with black goat eyes. He SHOUTS at her in a gibberish\n          of tongues! His body jerks up into the air. He dances a jig\n          atop the table, now laughing uncontrollably.\n          t \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          76.\n          Stephanie watches in horror.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Lamial I command you to leave this--\n          A chair sails through the air and shatters across Rham Jas'\n          back, knocking him to the ground.\n          Milos' body is hurled up against the chandelier, shattering\n          it. Glass rains down upon Stephanie.\n          on the ceiling, Milos is spun.about like a pin wheel.\n          Stephanie races for the door but a\n          .huge bureau lurches in\n          front of her, blocking her path.\n          Rham Jas rouses a stunned Shaun San Dena.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          You must banish the spirit!\n          Shaun San Dena places her hands on her ayes, then over her\n          heart and chants an ancient Gypsy incantation up toward\n          Milos.\n          Milos SHRIEKS. A white vapor streams from his body as the\n          Lamia is torn from him.\n\n          MILOS\n          (in his normal voice)\n          Stop the chanting. I beg you!\n          But Shaun San Dena only chants louder. Milos SCREAMS grow\n          more intense as-his body spasms in pain.

Stephanie pulls away\n          but it costs her a clump of hair that Mrs. Ganush rips from\n          her head.\n          Mrs. Ganush opens her mouth... wide... wider still... she\n          vomits out Stephanie's dead cat. It lands atop the table.\n          Stephanie screams uncontrollably.\n          Shaun San Dena, is trembling as her chanting comes to a\n          climax.\n          Mrs. Ganush changes back to the possessed Milo. The last of\n          the white vapor is torn from Milos body as the spirit of the\n          Lamia leaves him. Milos falls to the floor and all is quiet.\n          An ashen faced Shaun San Dena halts her chant.\n\n          10 STEPHANIE \n          Is it gone?\n          Stephanie notices that the cat has vanished.

The Lamia is gone.\n          Shaun San Dena grabs at her chest, struggles for breath.\n          Stephanie rushes over to steady her.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Let me help you...\n\n          SHAUN SAN DENA\n          My heart.\n          Shaun San Dena collapses into Stephanie's arms.

He fishes in his pocket for his car keys.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Perhaps on this final evening, you\n          should finish up the business of\n          this world.

He places the button within and seals it.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          The Lamia comes for the owner of\n          the accursed object. Just make a\n          gift of it...\n          To demonstrate, he hands the envelope to Stephanie.\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          .and you've given away the curse.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          80.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Why didn't you tell me this\n          before?!\n\n          RHAM JAS\n          Because we are speaking of murder.\n          Stephanie looks from the envelope containing the button to\n          Rham Jas.

OAKWOOD CEMETERY - RAINY NIGHT\n\n          A light drizzle falls as Stephanie'searches the graveyard for\n          the burial place of Mrs. Ganush. She carries the shovel\n          defensively, ready to swat at anything that might leap out at\n          her.\n          She stops before a freshly dug grave. A temporary marker\n          reads the name. \"Sylvia Ganush\".\n          She's scared now, not sure if she can really go through with\n          it. A church bell TOLLS five times. There's no time to think \n          about it. Stephanie looks around to make sure no one is\n          watching, then starts to dig.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n          LATER - It's raining harder. The hole Stephanie digs is now\n          several feet deep.\n          CLUNK: The shovel has hit the buried coffin. The rain\n          intensifies.\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n          LATER - Mud is pouring down the sides of the grave. In the\n          bottom of the pit Stephanie has unearthed the simple pine\n          casket. She jams the shovel blade between two boards and\n          pries off the coffin's top and shoves it aside.\n          A lightning flash illuminates the corpse. Mrs. Ganush's white\n          eye is open and staring at Stephanie.\n          Stephanie stows her fear and pulls the white envelope from\n          her coat.\n\n          16 40\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I'm giving it back to you.\n          She grabs Mrs. Ganush's hand and tries to get her clenched\n          fist to open, but rigor morris has locked it shut. Stephanie\n          pulls with all her might, causing...\n\n          MRS. GANUSH'S CORPSE\n          to lurch up and out of the coffin. Her dead arms, thrown\n          forward from the momentum, wrap around Stephanie. Stephanie\n          SCREAMS! The withered face leers! Stephanie pushes the corpse\n          away from her and the lifeless body falls back into the mud.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          You'll take it, all right...\n          She picks up the shovel and jams the blade into the old\n          woman's mouth, wedging it between her teeth. She pries the\n          jaw open. Mud and rivulets of water begin pouring down into\n          the grave from all sides. The body of Mrs. Ganush is quickly\n          being re-buried.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I, Stephanie Brown, do hereby make\n          a formal gift of this button to\n          you, Sylvia Ganush.\n          She jams the white envelope down the old woman's throat.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Choke on it, bitch.\n          She kicks the old woman's jaw.. It SNAPS shut, trapping the\n          envelope between her broken teeth.\n          Muddy water cascades down into the grave, flowing over Mrs..\n          Ganush's face. It covers everything, except the jutting\n          envelope and a single, staring white eye.\n          Stephanie tries to climb out but the walls are too slick.\n          She grabs at a clump of sod at the top of the hole but it\n          tears away, unleashing an avalanche of mud that buries her up\n          to her armpits.\n\n          THE HEAD OF MRS. GANUSH\n          Bobs up, through the mud. The Old Woman is grinning, with the\n          envelope still jammed between her teeth.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87.\n\n          LONG SHOT - THE GRAVE \n          Rivers of muddy water now pour in from every direction. It\n          has become the drain hole of the cemetery.\n\n          THE INFLUX OF MUD\n          pushes the old woman corpse against Stephanie. Her grinning\n          face led mashed against Stephanie's cheek. Stephanie's SCREAM\n          is cut short as she and Mrs. Ganush disappear beneath the\n          mud.\n          The only sound is the PITTER-PATTER of rain. CAMERA STARTS TO\n          PULL AWAY when...\n\n          STEPHANIE'S HAND\n          rips up through the mud, grasping the tree root.\n\n          STEPHANIE'S HEAD\n          Breaks the surface of the mud, sucking in air. She claws her\n          way out, then staggers away, through the pouring rain.\n\n           DISSOLVE TO: \n\n          INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN\n\n          STEPHANIE steps from the shower, quickly towels her hair. She\n          stops for a moment and studies herself in the mirror. She\n          has survived. The phone RINGS in the bedroom; the machine\n          picks up.\n\n          MR. JACKS' VOICE\n          Stephanie. It's Jim. Jim Jacks.\n          Sorry I'm calling so early-- but\n          Last night I found some troubling\n          information about our friend Stu\n          Rubin...\n\n          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n          EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN\n\n          A cleaned up Stephanie, her hair still wet from the shower,\n          drives the empty morning streets. A smile slowly comes to her\n          face as we hear the rest of Mr. Jack's message:\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88.\n\n          MR. JACKS' VOICE\n          Apparently he stole your file on 4\n          the Mcpherson loan and then tried\n          to broker his own deal at First\n          Federal. I guess he thought we\n          wouldn't find out. When I\n          confronted him he broke down crying\n          and well, we won't be seeing him\n          around anymore.\n\n          EXT. TRAIN STATION - PARKING LOT - PRE DAWN\n\n          The Eastern sky is growing brighter. Stephanie's car pulls\n          into the lot. She removes a week end bag from her trunk and\n          walks briskly toward the station.\n\n          MR JACKS\n\n          (V.O.)\n          It looks like the loan's coming\n          back to us. And I just wanted you\n          to know that come Monday morning,\n          that assistant manager's position\n          will be waiting for you.\n\n          INT. TRAIN STATION - GRAND ENTRANCE - PRE DAWN\n\n          Stephanie is smiling as she enters the station.\n\n          A MRS. FIELDS REPRESENTATIVE\n          holds a platter of freshly baked cookies and offers free\n          samples to passersby. One is offered to Stephanie.\n          She politely declines as she walks past with a bounce in her\n          step.\n\n          INT. TRAIN STATION - CLOTHING BOUTIQUE\n\n          She stops at the window, admiring a coat on display.\n          She glances down at her own coat. Notes the missing button.\n          with distaste.\n          Inside, a SALESWOMAN is preparing to open the shop.\n          Stephanie taps on the window, shouts through the glass:\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Hey! Good morning.\n\n          NO 4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89.\n          The Saleswoman opens the door a crack.\n          t \n\n          SALESWOMAN\n          I'm sorry, we're not open yet.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Please. I know what I want. That\n          coat in the window.\n          The Saleswoman considers.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          My boyfriend and I are taking a\n          very special trip this morning.\n          Stephanie's smile is bright. Her joy is contagious. The\n          Saleswoman relents and lets Stephanie in.\n\n          EXT. TRAIN STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAWN\n\n          Moments before sunrise, the sky is streaked red.\n          Ray waits on the train platform, clutching two tickets and a\n          small garment bag. Behind him, other Passengers arrive. From\n          his pocket, he removes a velvet case. He opens it and peeks\n          t inside A diamond ring. He stows it back in his pocket.\n          He looks for Stephanie.\n          Then, his face brightens as Stephanie emerges from the crowd,\n          radiant in her, new coat.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Ray!\n          Ray embraces her and grabs her luggage. A TRAIN WHISTLE\n          sounds as the train approaches.\n\n          RAY\n          Is everything okay?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Great.\n\n          RAY\n          I'm so glad you're here. There's so\n          much I've been meaning to tell you.\n          0 She takes his hand. 0\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          But let me say this first while I\n          have it straight in my head. You\n          never stopped believing in me. I'll\n          try and live up to that.\n          They share an intimate moment. A romantic kiss. He breaks off\n          and smiles.\n\n          RAY\n          Did I tell you, you look great?\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          Thanks.\n          Stephanie models her new coat.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          You like it? It's brand new.\n\n          RAY\n          What'd you do with your old coat?\n          Just the mention of it, makes her face darken.\n\n          STEPHANIE\n          I got rid of it. I never want to\n          see it again.\n\n          RAY\n          Too bad,'cause I just found this.\n          Ray produces the envelope. And from it, withdraws... THE\n\n          CURSED BUTTON!\n          CAMERA RACES INTO A HUGE CLOSE UP OF THE BUTTON with a\n          terrible CLASHING of symbols!.\n          Stephanie can't breathe.\n\n          RAY\n          Yeah, it was in my car. Hey, have\n          you seen my Indian Head nickel? I\n          put it in an envelope just like\n          this one.\n          Stephanie stares at the button, shaking her head in\n          disbelief. The RUMBLING of the approaching train builds on\n          the sound track.\n\n          4\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          91.\n\n          RAY\n          What? What is it?\n          She backs away in horror, but Ray follows her with the button\n          still in his hand.\n          The RUMBLING grows louder. She's backing up toward the edge\n          of the platform.\n\n          RAY\n          Stephanie. Stop!\n          Ray steps forward, still holding out the button. Stephanie\n          SHRIEKS as she falls backwards, off the platform and onto the\n          tracks.\n          In her last moment of life, she turns her head to see...\n\n          THE ONCOMING TRAIN\n          Racing at her!\n          Through the swirling smoke, the engine's mechanical face,\n          resembles the goat like face of the demon Lamia.\n          It VOMITS STEAM as it angrily bares down upon her.\n\n          THE TRAIN WHISTLE SHRIEKS!\n          Stephanie recognizes the sound. It's a cry she's heard\n          before. In every door creak... in every cold night wind... a\n          haunting, soulless sound... the cry of Lamia.\n          Ray races to the edge of the platform. The two lover's eyes\n          find each other one last time.\n          Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her\n          down into hell.\n\n          THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM\n          Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows\n          the truth. He looks to...\n\n          THE BUTTON\n          still in his hand.\n\n          CAMERA MOVES CLOSER ON RAY\n          \n\n          92.\n          A look of dread.
