BEDROOM - BEFORE DAWN\n</b>\n          22 year old Stephanie Browne is jarred from a peaceful sleep\n          as the alarm clock BUZZES. She hits the snooze button and\n          plops back down onto the pillow. After a few seconds of pure\n          sleeping bliss, she wills herself up.\n          She moves through her Ikea furnished bedroom, past a \"Hang in\n          there, baby\" poster and into the bathroom.\n\n<b>          INT.

Commuters speed by.\n          Stephanie's FORD FOCUS pulls into the PARKING STRUCTURE,\n          across the street from the BANK OF CALIFORNIA. She steps from\n          the car, smartly dressed for work and walks briskly toward\n          the intersection. The traffic signal changes to \"Don't Walk\".\n          A BUSINESS MAN next to her, sprints across the street.\n          Stephanie almost follows but decides to obey the sign.

No sign of Mrs. Ganush.\n          Stephanie makes her way toward the safety of her car.\n          Her FOOTSTEPS echo in the deserted structure, more loudly\n          than she would like.\n          She arrives at her car and quickly gets inside, locking the\n          doors behind her. She places the box of contracts on the seat\n          next to her. As she starts the engine, she notices a strange\n          sight: something moving, skimming along the surface of the\n          lot.\n          It's Mrs. Ganush's linen handkerchief.\n          It whisks about like a ghost, swirling closer and closer.\n          Stephanie watches transfixed, as it flies right toward her\n          car. It dips beneath her hood and is gone. It suddenly sweeps\n          up into view, flittering up, over her windshield, and is\n          carried off by the wind.\n          Stephanie breathes a sigh of relief just as two wrinkled\n          hands come up around her face!

But Stephanie grabs the old woman's wrists,\n          halting her.\n          The withered hands drop down to wrap around Stephanie's\n          throat. Stephanie fights for breath as she frantically\n          searches for a weapon. Her hand finds the box on the seat\n          next to her. She grabs a handful of colored push pins and\n          jams them into the old woman's arm. Mrs. Ganush releases her\n          grip. Stephanie has time for only a single gulp of air before\n          Mrs. Ganush grabs two fistfuls of Stephanie's hair!. The old\n          woman yanks upon it. Stephanie's head is pulled back, over\n          the edge of the seat. Ganush braces her feet against the back\n          of the front seat to pull even harder...

As the car' accelerates, Stephanie fastens her\n          shoulder harness with the last of her strength.\n          The old woman's stapled eyelid POPS open just in time for her\n          to see... an oncoming concrete column.\n          Stephanie's car slams into it. Stephanie is held fast by her\n          shoulder harness.\n          But Mrs. Ganush's body hurtles forward over the front seat,\n          impacting against the dashboard with tremendous force.\n          Close shot of the old woman's head slamming into the dash.

It was to be our way of \n          being together after he died. In\n          earlier times it was a sacred place\n          to the Tuanteteck indians. And\n          their stories told that the place\n          was a burial ground of the \"old\n          ones\" that inhabited the earth\n          before them. Here, there is a\n          particular alignment of energies. A\n          confluence, that allows doorways to\n          be opened.

Stephanie startles. Milos\n          reenters the room pulling a black goat along by a chain. The\n          goat catches sight of Stephanie. It BLEATS in fear and\n          attempts to run. But Milos holds it fast and tethers it to a\n          post.

It's a cry she's heard\n          before. In every door creak... in every cold night wind... a\n          haunting, soulless sound... the cry of Lamia.\n          Ray races to the edge of the platform. The two lover's eyes\n          find each other one last time.\n          Stephanie SCREAMS as the Lamia swallows her and pulls her\n          down into hell.\n\n<b>          THE PEOPLE ON THE PLATFORM\n</b>          Believe they have witnessed a train accident but Ray knows\n          the truth.
