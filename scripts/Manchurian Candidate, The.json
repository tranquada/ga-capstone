ARTHUR/SHAW N.Y. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON      118\n\n      Through the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone\n      volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW\n      logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert\n      Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the\n      limo door for Raymond.

A desk covered\n      with papers and enough take-out Chinese food for ten people,\n      and Raymond sits behind it, nursing a glass of wine, and\n      pointedly ignoring Melvin's notebook, while:\n\n                          RAYMOND\n\n                I kill Mavole?\n\n                          MARCO\n\n                It's a dream --\n\n                           RAYMOND\n\n                No.\n\n                          MARCO\n\n                -- could mean something else.\n\n                           RAYMOND\n\n                No.\n\n                          MARCO\n\n                -- could be I'm just supposed to think\n                you did.\n\n                          RAYMOND\n\n                -- I killed the enemy.

What a thought.\n      Now he picks up the dream book. Marco watches. Raymond\n      flips through the pages for a moment, dismissively. Then\n      stops at something Melvin has drawn. Frowns.

I mean, what\n                the fuck am I doing? Posing and grinning\n                like a goddamn sock puppet, shaking hands\n                with total strangers who must be blind if\n\n                          (MORE)\n\n\n\n\n\n                                            8/18/03    66.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    RAYMOND (CONT'D)\n\n          they can't see what I am, at the core.\n          What my mother has made me.\nRaymond looks steadily at Marco ... who nods, interested:\n\n                    RAYMOND\n\n          A Prentiss. Ferociously, a Prentiss --\n          but not a Shaw, God forbid -- I was\n          molded by cold hard hands, every detail\n          of my existence preordained. Can you\n          even imagine, Ben, how it would feel\n          never to have a say in what your life\n          would be? I was twenty years old before\n          I had a friend -- no, worse, a girlfriend\n          -- well, almost -- but, yes, a friend, or\n          I thought so -- outside my mother's\n          circle of approved encounters -- and it\n          didn't -- she wouldn't -- precipitating\n          my one act of rebellion, storming off and\n          enlisting --\n              (grimaces)\n          -- in the Army. Which, ironically, only\n          served ultimately to pad my gilded\n          Prentiss resume. You know: \"fluent in\n          five languages, Phi Beta Kappa,\n          Congressional Medal of Honor, blah blah\n          blah.\"\n              (beat)\n          And after the war I came back to her.\n          And the family legacy. This. Mother\n          calls it, \"fulfilling my Manifest\n          Prentiss Destiny.\"\n\n                    MARCO\n\n          Why did you come back, Raymond?

His eyes\nharden as he refocuses on Marco.\n\n                    RAYMOND\n\n          Weren't you listening? Mother happened.\n              (then)\n          You know, the truth is, I hate it.

I said I did.\n\n          MARCO\n\nYou said you don't remember doing it.\n\n          RAYMOND\n\nHa ha, don't mix me up, I'm tired, and --\nFine. It's like this. It's as if I know\nwhat will happen, Ben, but I never get to\nthe part where I feel that it actually\ndid happen. But I think that's probably\nperfectly normal.\n\n          MARCO\n\nDid you ever talk to anybody about this\nlittle discrepancy?\n\n          RAYMOND\n\nWhat? No. Who would I ask? My old Army\n\"buddies,\" who love and adore me for\nsaving their pathetically unimportant --\npresent company excluded -- asses?\n\n          MARCO\n\nNo.  You ask Army Intelligence.\n    (getting excited)\nLook, we can go together, tomorrow.
