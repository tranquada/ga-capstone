SECOND CLASS CARRIAGE. COUNTRY SIDE. DAY.                2\n\n    Leo Tolstoy (80), sits writing on his lapboard. He is quite\n    simply the greatest living writer in the world. His\n    devotion to pacifism, his rejection of the trappings of\n    Orthodoxy in favor of a simple Christian lifestyle convince\n    many to regard him as a living saint. With him are his much\n    younger wife, the COUNTESS SOFYA, favorite daughter SASHA,\n    and his personal physician DUSHAN MAKOVITSKY. Sasha and\n    Dushan write in their diaries. Sofya looks from one to the\n    next a little impatient. The train begins to slow.\n\n                        SOFYA\n              Why are we slowing down?\n\n    No one responds. Slower. Slower.\n\n                        SOFYA\n              We're stopping. Why are we\n              stopping?\n\n                        SASHA\n              I don't know, mother.

She goes to the window to\n    investigate. A crowd of a hundred peasants, students\n    surround the engine, block the track. They carry a huge\n    cloth banner honoring Tolstoy. We can hear voices chanting\n    \"Tolstoy. Tolstoy. Tolstoy\", voices crying \"You are the\n    truth.\" \"You are the hope of the Russian people.\"\n\n                        SOFYA\n              Oh, they won't move. We are\n              gonna die here. Leo, Leo, go and\n              say something to them. It's the\n              only way we are gonna get out of\n              here.\n\n    The chanting grows in intensity. Tolstoy gets to his feet,\n    walks to the window, shows himself to the crowd. A great\n    shout goes up. Tolstoy lifts his hand for silence.\n    Gradually, it comes.\n\n                        TOLSTOY\n              I have seen your banner. And I\u00b4ve\n              heard what you say. You think I\u00b4m\n              the hope of Russia, do you? Well,\n              that\u00b4s not true. You are the hope\n              of Russia. The hope of all the\n              world. You say, you want a new\n              way to live? Well, you are not\n              gonna find it making a fuss over\n              me. So, I suggest that you get on\n              with your work and let a poor old\n              men get on with his.\n\n    The cries begin. \"Clear the tracks. Let them pass. Let them\n    go.\" Tolstoy closes the door and waves to the crowd as the\n    train pulls away.\n\n\n3   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY.                                        3\n\n    On the chanting crowd now as the train pulls away. We\n    focus on a handsome young man, a little stiff maybe, a\n    little intellectual. This is VALENTIN FEDOROVITCH\n    BULGAKOV. He can't contain his enthusiasm. Over the noise\n    of the train.\n\n                        VALENTIN\n              Do you know who that is? That is\n              the greatest man in the world.\n\n    The train pulls away into the distance.\n\n    TITLE OVER BLACK: SPRING 1910\n\n\n4   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA.

Religious icons are given pride of place, a\n     testament, not to piety, but to an ingrained social\n     conservatism, a certain position in the world.\n\n     Countess Sofya mumbles her morning prayers before a make\n     shift altar.

YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY'S BEDROOM/STUDY. DAY.           6\n\n     Tolstoy has moved himself out of the refined upper floors\n     into a simple vaulted room he uses as both bedroom and\n     study. The walls are bare except for a portrait of his\n     daughter. The furniture is simple, some of it hand made: a\n     small bed against the wall, a little writing desk in one\n     corner stacked with books, littered with papers, more mail,\n     opened and unopened. Pairs of rude homemade shoes line a\n     work bench.\n\n     Tolstoy sleeps in his bed. Though it's late March and\n     still cold, the window is open. Sofya closes it. She\n     stands very still, watching Tolstoy sleep. Sitting on the\n     bed, she gently touches his hand, whispers.\n\n                          SOFYA\n               Darling.\n\n     She lies next to him, something girlish, hopeful in her\n     face, as if waiting for him to wake up and adore her, but\n     he sleeps on. She carefully takes his arm, positions it\n     under her neck, and rolling toward him, wraps it around\n     her. The image of love's intimacy, of wedded bliss.\n\n     His hand slips off her shoulder, once, twice. She moves\n     awkwardly to replace it. He moves a little toward her. She\n     kisses his neck, his cheek. We don't know if he's awake,\n     but even this shadow of intimacy penetrates her soul.\n\n\n7    OMITTED                                                       7\n\n                                                          4.\n\n\n8   INT. MOSCOW. STUDY. DAY.                                      8\n\n    A handsome study in the Moscow townhouse of VLADIMIR\n    GRIGOREVICH CHERTKOV, Tolstoy's most articulate and\n    dedicated disciple. He's interviewing Tolstoy's newly\n    appointed secretary, VALENTIN BULGAKOV, the young man we\n    met near the train, who, at the mention of sex, blushes a\n    little.\n\n                        CHERTKOV\n              But sex... You are twenty three.\n              Not an easy age for abstinence,\n              is it?\n\n                        VALENTIN\n              Tolstoy does not approve of\n              sexual relations. I know this.\n\n                        CHERTKOV\n              He despises them, in fact...\n\n    Chertkov reaches for a small tin of moustache wax.\n\n                        CHERTKOV\n              I don't want to belabor the\n              point, but I arranged for a\n              manservant last year who\n              proceeded to ruin two housemaids\n              just like that. He was very\n              upset.\n\n                        VALENTIN\n              This would not be a problem. I'm\n              celibate. I'm also a strict\n              vegetarian.\n\n    Chertkov nods his approval, begins to worry his moustache.\n\n                        CHERTKOV\n              Yes, I've heard many good things\n              about you. I've even read what\n              you`ve written. So has he.\n\n    Valentin's face flushes with pride. Chertkov steals a\n    glance at his reflection in the glass bookcase. One side of\n    his moustache droops a little. He tugs awkwardly at it.\n\n                        CHERTKOV\n              My dear boy, if you were to\n              become Tolstoy's private\n              secretary, you would be given a\n              great gift. You'll be with him\n              every day, eat together, walk in\n              the forest by his side.\n\n    It's difficult to contain himself.\n\n                                                        5.\n\n\n                     VALENTIN\n          Believe me, since becoming a\n          Tolstoyan, I have become so eager\n          to learn, so comitted to\n          discussing ideas, improving my\n          very soul.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n              (smiling)\n          Well, we have a lot to do if we\n          are to get his work to the\n          people.\n\n                     VALENTIN\n          We?\n\nThey both laugh.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Yes, we. If we can encourage the\n          spread of passive\n          resistance...just think of it\n          Valentin   thousands of ordinary\n          Russians casting off centuries of\n          spiritual and political\n          oppression-\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          In the name of truth and freedom.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Truth and freedom, yes but still,\n          my boy, there are so many enemies-\n\n                     VALENTIN\n          Enemies?\n\nChertkov walks to the window, signals Valentin to follow\nhim. He points to\n\nTWO MEN IN PLAINCLOTHES standing in the street below.\n\n                     CHERTKOV\n          The Czar's police...You'll be\n          followed when you leave\n          here...and the church will stop\n          at nothing to bring him back into\n          the fold.

Someone who can help him\n          with the new work. Someone who\n          understands his goals.\n\nChertkov returns to the desk.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          And although they've allowed me\n          to return to Russia, I can't see\n          him. They keep me under house\n          arrest... They might as well keep\n          me in a cage.\n\nClearly upset, Chertkov pauses to get control of himself.\nHe picks up a package, hands it to Valentin.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          So, I need you to put these\n          letters directly into his hands.\n          One can't be sure what gets\n          through to him.\n\nValentin looks at him, quizzical.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Sofya Andreyevna does not respect\n          his privacy.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          She wouldn't open his private\n          correspondence...\n\nChertkov raises an eyebrow.

Let\n          me know who visits the house, any\n          talk of the copyright to his\n          work, any contact with the\n          church, what letters come and go.\n              (beat)\n          Anything Sofya Andreyevna says.\n\n                                                              7.\n\n\n                           VALENTIN\n               Anything?\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               She's very, very dangerous.\n\n\n9    EXT.

He writes in\n     the diary given him by Chertkov. He glances up to see, on\n     the bench across, a young mother taking out her breast to\n     nurse her baby. He blushes, doesn't know where to look. An\n     old peasant catches his eye, winks at him, laughs.\n\n\n16   EXT. TELYATINKI.

Just last week\n               we had a visitor from India.

He notices a surly\n     house servant, IVAN, who, inexplicably, leads a goat\n     through the house. He points upstairs and walks away.\n\n\n24   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. DAY.                           24\n\n     Alone now among Tolstoy's books, Valentin makes his way\n     slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which War\n     and Peace and Anna Karenina were written. He runs his hand\n     along the old wood top. Emboldened by a backward glance, he\n     sits in Tolstoy's chair. Before him are stacks of letters,\n     pens and pencils, a pot of India ink. There's a notebook\n     lying open. He leans forward to read it. A noise in the\n     hall stops him.\n\n     Tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard\n     dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he\n     is. Valentin stands.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               I'm glad you're here. So glad.\n\n                                                       16.\n\n\nHe tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically\non both cheeks. Valentin is overcome by the great man's\nwarmth.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          I'm... I'm... Here is-\n\nValentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          God bless you.\n\n                       VALENTIN\n          I'm sorry.     Sometimes I...\n\nValentin pulls out a letter of introduction. Tolstoy takes\nit out and puts it down without a glance.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          Vladimir Grigorevich has already\n          written about you at length. I\n          need your help badly. The\n          manifesto against the government\n          is hard work. They commit their\n          idiotic abuses faster than I can\n          catalogue them...and the new\n          book...\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          He told me about it...It's very\n          exciting.\n\nTolstoy nods.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          I've become convinced that all\n          the world's religions have a\n          single organizing principle. Can\n          you guess what it is? Love!\n          Love! Simple... Now, I want to\n          talk about you. How are you? How\n          was your journey? Come, sit\n          down.\n\nTolstoy sits on the old sofa. Valentin follows suit.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          You know, I was born on this\n          sofa...\n\nValentin gets right back up. Tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.\n\n                       TOLSTOY\n          Sit.

How`s\n               your work progressing?\n\n     Valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. He tries\n     to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.\n\n                          TOLSTOY\n               My boy, what is it?\n                   (beat)\n               I upset you in some way. Was it\n               the sofa? It's only a sofa.\n\n     Valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm very happy. You are very\n               kind. I'm no one and you are...\n               you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask\n               me about my work.\n\n     Tolstoy takes Valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               You rest for a moment and I'll\n               fetch you a glass of tea. Rest,\n               because there's work for both of\n               us together.\n\n     He smiles and goes, leaving Valentin to contemplate his\n     fortune.\n\n\n25   OMITTED                                                       25\n\n\n26   OMITTED                                                       26\n\n\n27   OMITTED                                                       27\n\n\n28   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS. DAY.                           28\n\n     Sofya, Sasha, Valentin, ANDREY, Tolstoy's son, and Tolstoy\n     all clustered around a table taking tea. Dushan stands near\n     the group fiddling with a gramophone that sits on a small\n     table.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               These people have nothing.\n\n                                                    18.\n\n\n                     DUSHAN\n           It really is the most\n           extraordinary thing.\n\nAbsolutely ignoring him.\n\n                     SOFYA\n           It's not for lack of land that\n           the muzhiks live in poverty.\n           They have no will power and they\n           drink too much.\n\n                     TOLSTOY\n           I'm not suggesting they be given\n           land. Private property is the\n           root of the problem... We should\n           be giving ours away.\n\n                     ANDREY\n           Give it to whom?\n\n                     SOFYA\n           It's all ridiculous. You think\n           that poverty makes the peasants\n           somehow morally superior.\n\n                     TOLSTOY\n           I believe that wealth corrupts us\n           all, yes I do.\n\nA pause.   Valentin fills the silence.\n\n                     VALENTIN\n           It's a keystone of the movement.\n\n                     SOFYA\n           Oh, I know all about the\n           movement.\n\nA pause. Valentin notices that people from the front lawn\nhave moved up to watch all this. Life in the fishbowl, the\nTolstoys seem neither to notice nor care.\n\n                     TOLSTOY\n           If the peasants had money, they\n           wouldn't surround themselves, as\n           we do, with footmen costing ten\n           rubles a month.\n\n                     SOFYA\n           No, they'd spend it on drink and\n           whores.\n\n                     TOLSTOY\n           Valentin Fedorovich, do you think\n           fifty years from now, people will\n           eat while grown men walk around\n           and wait on them hand and foot?\n\n                                                     19.\n\n\nValentin doesn't know what to say. A giggle from Dushan.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          Oh, that's good...that's good.\n\nDushan, having sat at table, tries surreptitiously to get\ndown Tolstoy's words in the diary he holds below the table.\nSofya flushes with anger.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          I think...(sneeze)\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Stop scribbling!\n              (points to her husband)\n          You all think he's Christ, don't\n          you? He thinks he's Christ.\n\nThere is an awkward pause.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n              (flustered)\n          I'm not...I don't believe Leo\n          Nikolayevich is Christ. Christ is\n          Christ but...\n\n                      SOFYA\n          But what?\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          I believe he's one of the\n          prophets. God speaks through him.\n          I recognize the cadence in his\n          voice.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          This is unbearable. No wonder I\n          feel lonely. I'm surrounded by\n          morrons.\n\n                    SASHA\n          Mama, you're being ridiculous.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Am I? I sit here and listen to\n          this talk of love and God and\n          equality, knowing full well that\n          Count Generosity here is fully\n          prepared to give away everything\n          we have.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n              (exhausted)\n          You keep going on like that...Why\n          do you think we should profit\n          from the work I\u00b4m doing which is\n          only meant for the sake of the\n          people.\n\n                                                       20.\n\n\nShe turns to see Dushan scribbling again.\n\n                     SOFYA\n          STOP IT!   STOP WRITING NOW!\n\nValentin glances at Sasha, uncomfortable at these\noutbursts. A long pause. Dushan tries to relieve the\ntension.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          In defense of my gift, let me\n          demonstrate. It's quite\n          remarkable, really.\n\nHe gets up, places a record on the gramophone, needle on\nthe record. What comes forth is not music, but Tolstoy's\nvoice.\n\nIt is a recording of a recent speech against capital\npunishment. His voice booms, tinny and distorted. Dushan\nwalks to the machine, stares at it in awe. Valentin is\ncompletely caught up in the technology.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          It's your voice. It's wonderful.\n\nThey all listen for a moment, look to Tolstoy for a\nresponse.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          It's tiresome. Another\n          remarkable invention will\n          supercede it.\n\nValentin blushes and looks at the table. Dushan tries to\nhide his disappointment.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          Please excuse me.\n\nTolstoy rises, leaves the table, walks out onto the lawn.\nDushan gets up quickly, bumping the table as he goes. Tea\nspills. Valentin moves to wipe it up, sneezes, a barrage of\nirritable blessings.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          Leo Nikolayevich is something of\n          a Luddite, I fear.\n\nSofya crosses to the machine, removes the record from the\ngramophone, replaces it with another Dushan has brought.\n\nSuddenly, the air is filled with   the final duet from\nMozart's Il Nozze di Figaro. She   returns to her place.\nThere is a long moment where all   take in the sublimity of\nit. Tolstoy walks slowly back to   the table. He stands\ncompletely still. Tears fill his   eyes and roll down his\ncheeks.\n\n                                                            21.\n\n\n                          TOLSTOY\n                Oh, that\u00b4s better. That\u00b4s nice.\n                Very nice indeed.\n\n     Sofya crosses to her husband, wipes the tears off his face.\n     Valentin watches as they embrace.\n\n                          VALENTIN (O.S.)\n                Do your parents often speak to\n                each other so...bluntly?\n\n\n29   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY. EVENING.                      29\n\n     Across from Tolstoy's writing desk is Sasha's world, a\n     makeshift office lined with more bookcases where she does\n     her work, sending cables, editing manuscripts, answering\n     endless stacks of mail. Valentin sits near her, learning\n     the ropes.\n\n                           SASHA\n                My mother doesn't understand my\n                father's goals, not since his\n                work as a novelist became\n                secondary.    His commitment to\n                the spiritual life offends her.\n                They've fought about it for\n                years.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                I'm sure she means well.\n\n     Sasha just looks at him.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                Your father is the greatest\n                writer in the world.\n\n                          SASHA\n                Quite.\n\n     A pause.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                I mean to say, I feel privileged\n                to be here. It's an... honor.\n\n     Valentin feels himself slip further into mundanity. Sasha\n     goes back to her letter.   Valentin SNEEZES.\n\n                          SASHA\n                God Bless You.\n\n     They read together for a moment.   He sneezes again.\n\n                          SASHA\n                    (irritated)\n                God bless you.\n\n                                                          22.\n\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm sorry. Sometimes I sneeze\n               when I'm nervous.\n\n     She regards him like an animal in the zoo. Ivan appears at\n     the door.\n\n                         SASHA\n               What is it?\n\n                         IVAN\n               It\u00b4s a note, for him.\n\n     He nods toward Valentin.\n\n                         SASHA\n               Well, give it to him then.\n\n     Valentin reads the note.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n               It\u00b4s from your mother. She wants\n               to see me.\n\n     As Valentin goes,\n\n                         SASHA\n               She is looking for allies. Pay\n               attention. This is war.\n\n\n30   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.                   30\n\n     Sofya is settled on a divan in a small room off the dining\n     room. Valentin sits beside her holding a glass of tea.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               I see a fine young man before me.\n               Clear eyes. Nice features, rather\n               handsome in a peculiar way.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Thank you, Countess...\n\n                          SOFYA\n               Call me Sofya Andreyevna. We\n               don't stand on formality here, as\n               you may have observed.\n                   (beat)\n               Many young men ruin their looks\n               by loose living. You're a real\n               Tolstoyan, I can tell!\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I admire your husband immensely.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               That's excellent. He likes that.\n\n                                                     23.\n\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          His ideas are beautiful...social\n          justice...the idea...Don't you\n          think?\n\nSofya drains her tea cup, signals for more.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          He's very grateful for the help\n          you've been giving him. He told\n          me so himself. I think it\n          surprises him that a young man\n          would be so diligent. When he was\n          your age, he was whoring in the\n          Caucasus.\n\nValentin's eyes are wide. She nods.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          He wrote it all down. He even\n          gave me a copy, so I could read\n          all the details...\n\n                       VALENTIN\n          Thank you.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You've read War and Peace?\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          Many times... twice.\n\nSofya smiles at his honesty.\n\n                     SOFYA\n          When he was writing it, long\n          before Chertkov created that\n          monstrosity at Telyatinki, before\n          all this \"new religion\" and\n          revolutionary nonsense...\n              (beat)\n          What do you think of Chertkov, by\n          the way?\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          He's given me an extraordinary\n          opportunity.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          But you see what a fool he is, a\n          self-serving puritanical idiot. I\n          have to say, it's been extremely\n          pleasant since they've locked him\n          in his house.\n\nSofya smiles. Valentin is nonplussed by her directness.\n\n                                                        24.\n\n\n                    SOFYA\n          When my husband was writing it,\n          in the mid-sixties, he'd bring me\n          pages to re-copy everyday.\n          I was the only one who could read\n          his handwriting. I could read his\n          intentions, too. Afternoons, we'd\n          drink tea and discuss changes.\n          \"Natasha wouldn't say that to\n          Prince Andrey,\" or \"Pierre's too\n          simple here. He's not stupid.\"\n\nShe smiles at the memory.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          But I don't count anymore.\n\nSilence. She sips her tea. She glances out the door to see\nSasha hovering nearby. Listening? Sasha walks away.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You must help me, Valentin\n          Fedorovich. I want only what is\n          best for my husband and my\n          family. I could tolerate the\n          situation if it only concerned me\n          What I can not do is sit back\n          while they steal my children's\n          inheritance. Do you know I was\n          the only person. I could\n          understand his intention.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          I don't believe anyone wants to\n          do that.\n\nSofya gives him a condescending smile. She produces a\npackage from the table beside her, hands it to him.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          I have a little gift for you\n\nHe opens it, extracts a small leather bound book. He stares\nat it.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          It's a diary.\n          (beat)\n          Everyone should always keep a\n          diary.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          It's a very popular activity\n          around your husband.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You're teasing me, but I trust\n          you'll write the truth.\n\n                                                          25.\n\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               That may not be so easy.\n\n                          SOFYA\n               Nonsense. You've been listening\n               to your friends at Telyatinki...\n                   (beat)\n               Write what you see.

See.\n\n     Valentin fingers the package, stifles a sneeze.\n\n                           SOFYA\n               More tea?\n\n\n31   EXT. TELYATINKI COMPOUND. DAY                                31\n\n     Valentin rides into the compound. A number of the disciples\n     are outside working. There is the ringing of metal on\n     wood. He looks for the source. As the way clears a little,\n     he sees Masha chopping away with an axe. He stops his horse\n     to watch her.\n\n                         MASHA\n               You're finished for the day?\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               He didn't need me this afternoon.\n\n     He gets down off his horse. Masha continues to chop. He\n     picks up an axe, holds it awkwardly.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n               Leo Nikolayevich disapproves of\n               women doing physical labor.\n                   (beat)\n               Don't you find that reactionary?\n\n                         MASHA\n               No, I find it sweet. I find you\n               reactionary.\n\n     She laughs. Valentin picks up a log, sets it on end and\n     begins to chop. He doesn't do it well. Masha smiles at his\n     struggle.\n\n                         MASHA\n               He admires you, I believe.\n\n     What's she saying?\n\n                         MASHA\n               Sergeyenko told me.

Almost\nimmediately the log becomes stuck to the blade of the axe.\nHe bangs it, bangs it trying to free it. He glances up to\nsee her still looking at him. He pounds again and again.\n\nShe stops, reaches for his axe, touching him as she does.\nShe lifts the big axe, log and all, above her head,\nbringing it down hard. The log splits. She hands the axe to\nhim.\n\n                    MASHA\n          I had a lover before I came\n          here... headmaster of a school\n          where I taught. He was married -\n          happily married. It was\n          difficult. We could make love\n          only at school.\n\nThis is somehow more than Valentin had bargained for.\n\n                       VALENTIN\n          At school?\n\n                    MASHA\n          In the gymnasium, after the girls\n          had gone. There were straw mats\n          on the floor.\n\n                       VALENTIN\n          I see...\n\n                                                     27.\n\n\nHe looks away to hide his confusion.\n\n                    MASHA\n          Have I upset you?\n\nHe looks at her.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          No...I appreciate your frankness\n\n                    MASHA\n          But you disapprove of me. I see\n          it in your eyes.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          I don't. Not at all...I think\n          sexual activity...how men and\n          women combine their physical\n          parts is completely neutral.\n\n                    MASHA\n          Listen to you. You're a prig.\n          Just like Sergeyenko. Why else\n          would they have hired you?\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          That's not fair\n\n                    MASHA\n          I don't care if it's fair. It's\n          true...neutral...my God...\n\n                       VALENTIN\n          I'm going.\n\nHe puts down the axe.\n\n                    MASHA\n          Do as you like.\n\nShe goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he\nwalks toward the house. The chopping stops.\n\n                    MASHA\n          Valentin Fedorovich.\n\nHe stops, relieved and turns to face her.\n\n                    MASHA\n          You forgot your horse.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          Yes. You know, I think that I...\n          never mind.\n\nHe hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back\nis to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his\nface as he tries to salvage a little dignity.\n\n                                                             28.\n\n\n      He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings,\n      trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights\n      himself. The chopping behind him remains constant.\n      Sergeyenko watches him from the porch.\n\n\n32    INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY.

Any effort she makes to\n               shore up control of the\n               copyright, I must know. The\n               survival of our movement depends\n               on it. Remember who your friends\n               are. What you've come here to do.\n\n     Chertkov turns away to watch the countryside.

Closing his eyes, he\n     begins to drift off when there is a noise outside his door.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Hello...

She carries a candle which reveals her short\n     hair, her lovely eyes.\n\n                            VALENTIN\n               Masha.\n\n     She says nothing, simply crawls into bed, positions her\n     knees on either side of him. She leans forward and kisses\n     him.\n\n                            VALENTIN\n               Masha.\n\n                            MASHA\n               Ssshh.\n\n     She begins to move against him. Their faces touch. She\n     doesn't kiss him, but he can feel her breath. She sits up.\n\n                         MASHA\n               Move the book.\n\n                            VALENITN\n               What?\n\n                            MASHA\n               Your book.\n\n     It's true.

Masha, then, pulls her nightdress over\n     head, exposing her small breasts, her flat stomach.\n\n                                                          35.\n\n\n     She reaches under the sheets, curls her fingers around him.\n     He flinches at the pleasure of it.\n\n                         MASHA\n               Is it alright?\n\n     He can't speak. Only nod. He bites his lip as she slips him\n     into her and begins to rock. The pleasure is too much, and\n     he comes too quickly. She falls forward on him, begins to\n     laugh.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               What...what is it?\n\n                         MASHA\n               You really are a virgin.\n\n     Valentin tenses a little.\n\n                          MASHA\n               I'm playing.

He sits in a chair beside\n     Chertkov beneath a large banner : \"Leo Tolstoy, Friend of\n     the People.\". Behind him, the disciples lay out a\n     vegetarian feast on a plank table. Photographers and a\n     cinematographer are strategically positioned to record the\n     event.\n\n     Each child gives Tolstoy a flower. Chertkov, in turn, hands\n     each child a photograph of the Count giving money to the\n     poor.\n\n     Valentin enters, flushed and blushing. He pauses beside\n     Dushan who records the scene in his diary, tears in his\n     eyes.\n\n                         DUSHAN\n               Look at the love in him, like\n               Jesus..suffering the\n               children...all that...\n\n     Tolstoy greets a little boy affectionately, rubs his\n     knuckles over the boy's shaved head.

Maria\n          Filipovna.\n\nMasha comes to stand beside him. She glances at Valentin\nbut he won't make eye contact with her.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          You're both looking so well. Life\n          here at Telyatinki obviously\n          agrees with you.\n\nValentin sneezes mightily, moves a little away.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          God bless you, boy. What are you\n          nervous about, now? Sit down.

Valentin is in\nagony.\n\n                    MASHA\n          We're happy to have you with us.\n\nTolstoy notices a mosquito on Valentin's cheek. He takes\nthe bug between his big fingers, squeezes until it pops.\nChertkov watches in horror, whispers loudly.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          What are you doing?\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          What do you mean?\n\nHe motions to the photographers.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          You've killed a living thing.\n\nChertkov hears a laugh behind him.   It is Masha who has\nover heard the whole thing.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Do you have something to say?\n\n                    MASHA\n          It's absurd.

Valentin stares at her.\n\n                                                            39.\n\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               What are you saying?\n\n                         MASHA\n               I'm sorry but- It's a mosquito.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               Forgive him. He can't help it.\n               He's a better Tolstoyan than I\n               am.\n\n     She can't help laughing again. Valentin sees the color rise\n     in Chertkov's face.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               It's not the message we want to\n               send.\n\n     Sasha suddenly appears.

This is who I am.\n                This is what you married. We're\n                older, maybe we're old, but I'm\n                still your little chicken\n                    (beat)\n                You're still my big cock.\n\n      She smiles at him.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Let me make you crow.\n\n      A pause, then a huge laugh comes up from the very center of\n      him. He twists his neck, thrusts his head upward, crows\n      like a rooster.\n\n      He virtually runs to her, embraces her, kisses her. She is\n      a giddy girl in his arms. He breaks the embrace and begins\n      strutting around the room.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Let me make you sing.\n\n      He takes her in his arms, again, begins to kiss her neck.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Do you love me?\n\n                           TOLSTOY\n                I do.\n\n                          SOFIA\n                I want you to love me.\n\n      He stops kissing her, looks her in the eye. Then, another\n      loud crow. Laughing, they fall into each other again.\n\n\n53A   EXT. YASNAYA POLYANA. GROUNDS.

What we did is what\n               men and women do, have done, will\n               continue doing. What could be\n               more simple? We touched each\n               other-- stayed close together.\n               Something passed between us.\n               Something real. That is a\n               betrayal of what? Of nothing.\n                         (MORE)\n\n                                                          43.\n\n                         MASHA (cont'd)\n               But you're afraid... All your\n               ideas. What are you afraid of?\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm afraid I've hurt you, haven\u00b4t\n               I?\n\n                         MASHA\n               No. I feel a little sad, but it\n               is not for me.

Wrapped in a blanket, he writes in his diary,\n     a cup of tea in front of him.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               Good morning, my darling?

A pause. He\nfollows suit. After a moment...\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Laughing about the fact that\n          you've developed a senile crush\n          on a fat middle aged flatterer.\n          Your passion for Chertkov has\n          become a standing joke.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          I have a great affection for\n          Vladimir Grigorivich. Let them\n          laugh if they find it amusing.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          But it's not amusing, darling.\n          It's sick. It's not normal. You\n          hang on his every word.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          We have a great deal in common.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You have nothing in common. You\n          are a genius. He's a sycophant\n          and a pervert.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          Because he understands what I'm\n          trying to do? Because he tries\n          to help me accomplish it?\n\n                    SOFYA\n          He is using you. You just can't\n          seem to see it.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          This is absolute nonsense.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          That bold, obese, idiotic man.\n          You treat him...\n\nHe turns to her...his face red with anger and frustration.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          It's impossible for you not to\n          distract me. Let me alone... for\n          God's sake. You're like a spoiled\n          child.\n\n                                                            45.\n\n\n      He rises, spits on the ground, goes into the house.

DAY.                               65\n\n     Masha carries two water buckets suspended from a pole\n     across her shoulders. Arriving at a stream, she takes each\n     bucket and fills it. It's hot work. Pausing a moment, she\n     kneels to splash water on her face.\n\n     Another P.O.V. - someone watches her from the trees.\n\n     As Masha wets a cloth, puts it around her neck. Suddenly\n     someone grabs her from behind. She screams, wrestle her\n     way free. She turns to see Valentin, flushed, smiling,\n     excited. He steps toward her, kicks over one of the\n     buckets.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Sorry, sorry, I'll...

Leo\n            Nikolayevich,...I love to listen\n            to him. I love nothing more...\n\nHe moves closer to her.\n\n                      VALENTIN\n            But today I could hardly\n            concentrate.\n\nHe's very close to her, now.\n\n                      VALENTIN\n            All I could think of was you.\n\nMasha shakes her head, moves away from him. Begins to\ngather the pole, to refill the spilled bucket. Stops her,\nturns her to him.\n\n                      VALENTIN\n            What's wrong?\n\n                      MASHA\n            I think I've confused you. I've\n            confused us both.\n\n                      VALENTIN\n            No. No. You didn\u00b4t confuse me..I\n            was stupid. I was afraid, but I'm\n            not afraid anymore.\n\nValentin wants to fight through the awkwardness. He tries\nto kiss her. She won't have it. She pulls away.\n\n                      VALENTIN\n            I love you, Masha!\n\n                      MASHA\n            Maybe you could help me a little.\n\nIn silence, he gets the filled buckets balanced on the\npole. Without another word, Masha starts toward the\nbuildings. He doesn't know what to do. He's losing her. He\nshouts.\n\n                       VALENTIN\n            Masha...\n\nShe turns\n\n                                                            52.\n\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Before the other night...I'd\n               committed the act of copulation\n               many times in my heart.\n\n     He has her attention now, as well as that of a number of\n     the disciples who look up from their work in the yard.\n\n                         MASHA\n               Yes...\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I think about you all the time.\n               In my heart I\u00b4ve comitted the act\n               of copulation many times. I just\n               want to say...It was never like\n               it was with you.\n\n     Masha bursts out laughing.\n\n                         MASHA\n               I'll wait for you, then.\n\n     As Valentin goes to catch her up, he sees Sergeyenko\n     watching from outside the unfinished chicken coop.\n\n\n66   OMITTED                                                      66\n\n\n67   INT.

He walks\n     to the door, then very deliberately.\n\n                           CHERTKOV\n               If I had a wife like you, I would\n               have blown my brains out long\n               ago.\n                    (beat)\n               Or gone to America.\n\n     He leaves the room. Sofya sinks back to the floor, a flower\n     wilting. She begins to weep. An Aria from Madame Butterfly\n     comes over\n\n\n78   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. DINING ROOM. NIGHT.                    78\n\n     From a record on the gramophone. The table is set for ten,\n     although no one is at dinner but Sofya Andreyevna and\n     Valentin. He is visibly uncomfortable. An awkward silence.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I hope you're feeling better.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               Do you like the opera?\n\n                          VALENTIN\n               I took singing lessons for years.\n               I thought about a career in\n               music.

Despite good cause\n          for alienation between us, I have\n          never stopped loving you.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Of course...\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n          God knows you don't make it easy.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Why should it be easy?

If we cannot\n          live a decent, quiet life, if I\n          cannot work, if I cannot find\n          some peace, I shall simply go\n          away.\n\n                       SOFYA\n          Go?

I hate what you've\n          become.\n\nShe picks up another plate, lets it fall. Now, she acts as\nif she's choking or gasping for breath.\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          Countess...Are you alright?\n\nShe fights with her collar, rips open the front of her\ndress.\n\n                    TOLSTOY\n              (shouts)\n          DUSHAN!!!\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You'll destroy me.\n\nDushan runs into the room. Sofya continues to tear at her\nclothes, stops, begins to pant, then falls to the floor in\na faint.\n\n                                                          60.\n\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Is she alright?\n\n     Tolstoy tries to answer, but is overcome by a coughing fit.\n     Dushan starts toward him but Tolstoy waves him in the\n     direction of Sofya. He kneels beside her.\n\n                         DUSHAN\n               Sofya! Open your eyes.\n\n                         SOFYA\n               My back. My back...

NIGHT.                           81\n\n     It's late. The house is quiet. Valentin walks into the\n     kitchen to see Masha washing the dishes. Exhausted, he\n     sits, stares at the floor.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               It was terrible there today...\n               between them.

Look, when I read his\n          Confession, it moved me, Valya.\n          He was searching for freedom.\n          Freedom from anger. Freedom from\n          attachment. Freedom from all the\n          superstition and nonsense of the\n          church. It moved me so much. I\n          thought that's what it would be\n          about. Isn't that what it's\n          about? Freedom and love? But\n          they mix it all up.\n\nMasha reaches out and puts her arms around him.

One of\n     them peers into her eyes with a sextant-like instrument.\n\n     We move into the hall to find DR.

Valentin and Tolstoy pick their\n     way through the thick undergrowth.\n\n     As they come into a clearing. Valentin is surprised to see\n     a portable table and several chairs set up like lawyers\n     office in the middle of the wood. Sergeyenko fiddles with a\n     piece of paper on the desk. Chertkov comes toward them.\n\n     Tolstoy stops his horse. He turns to Valentin with tears in\n     his eyes.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               You see, I no longer feel I have\n               a choice in the matter.

They lead him to a nearby stump\nand place the writing board before him. Sergeyenko hands a\ndocument to Chertkov who lays it on the board.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          This will insure that the\n          complete works will live in the\n          public domain.\n\n                    SERGEYENKO\n          Monumentous.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Your work is the birthright of\n          the Russian people.

No pen.\n\n                       SERGEYENKO\n          I...uh...\n\n                       CHERTKOV\n          What?\n\nSergeyenko moves close to Chertkov, close enough to\nwhisper.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          You're a secretary.       How can you\n          not have a pen?\n\nSergeyenko points at Valentin.\n\n                    SERGEYENKO\n          He's a secretary, too.      Ask him.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          Valentin Fedorovich, do you have\n          a pen?\n\n                                                             65.\n\n\n     Valentin hesitates for a moment, looks at Tolstoy, seated\n     on the stump, staring into the middle distance.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I do.\n\n     Valentin fetches it from his satchel.\n\n     Pen in hand, Tolstoy hovers over the document. A long\n     moment.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Are you alright?\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               I feel like a conspirator.\n\n     Sergeyenko laughs. Chertkov glares at him. It's beyond\n     awkward. Valentin looks to the sky, sees the crows\n     circling again.\n\n     Without further hesitation, Tolstoy picks up the pen and\n     signs the document. Then he moves away from the group.\n     Valentin watches him.\n\n\n84   EXT. ZASYEKA WOODS.

May I ask you\n               something that has nothing to do\n               with work?\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               Of course, my dear.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Do you love your wife?\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               \" Your youth and your desire for\n               happiness reminds me cruelly of\n               my age and the impossibility of\n               happiness for me.\" When I was\n               courting Sofya, she was so young\n               and pure, it seemed impossible\n               that I'd ever have her.\n               I didn't want to tell her how I\n               felt and I wanted to tell her\n               nothing else. So I wrote down a\n               string of letters and asked her\n               if she could decipher them. She\n               looked completely confused,\n               thinking it was a game or...\n\n                                                              66.\n\n\n     Tolstoy looks into the middle distance, remembering his\n     love.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               I gave her one clue. The first\n               two Y's, I said, stand for \"your\n               youth\" and then the most\n               miraculous thing happened. She\n               simply spoke the phrase, my\n               phrase...\n\n     Tolstoy looks at Valentin as if the boy might offer some\n     explanation of the miraculous.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               ...as if she had read my mind.\n               In that moment, we both knew we\n               would always be together. For\n               those first years, we were\n               incredibly happy, terrifyingly\n               happy.\n\n     His old eyes are wet.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               And now this.\n\n     Tolstoy reaches into his boot, extracts his SECRET DIARY.\n     He takes a pen from his shirt, begins to write. Valentin is\n     amazed. HE HAD A PEN ALL THE TIME.\n\n\n85   INT. TELYATINKI. MEETING ROOM. NIGHT.                          85\n\n     Valentin exhausted, sits at the long table.   Chertkov\n     appears at his office door.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Thank you again, Valentin\n               Fedorovich, for your forethought.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm a secretary, after all.\n\n     Chertkov let's it go.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               You know I had thought for a time\n               to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich\n               look for someone else. But...he\n               said no. He said \"He reminds me\n               of myself when I was young.\"\n\n     He goes. After a moment, Valentin gets up and goes to the\n     study door.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm leaving Telyatinki.\n\n                                                          67.\n\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Really.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I am going to Moscow.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               She is leading you around the\n               nose.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Look, you say the movement's\n               about love-\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Yes... The love he tells us to\n               practice, the love of the\n               Gospels. Why do I have to explain\n               this? Perfect love. Eternal love.\n               The love that binds mankind\n               together.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               But I've never met mankind, only\n               men and women, imperfect men,\n               imperfect women.\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us\n               love can not be weakminded.\n               Go. You won't be missed ...a\n               naive sentimentalist\n\n     Valentin looks at him for a long moment, then bursts out\n     laughing, walks away\n\n                         CHERTKOV\n               Why are you laughing? You think\n               I'm ridiculous.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               I'm laughing because I didn't\n               sneeze.\n\n\n86   OMITTED                                                    86\n\n\n87   OMITTED                                                    87\n\n\n88   OMITTED                                                    88\n\n                                                          68.\n\n\n89   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. TOLSTOY STUDY/BEDROOM. DAY.            89\n\n     Tolstoy has fallen asleep at his desk, his SECRET DIARY\n     open before him. Sofya enters without knocking. He bolts up\n     groggily, tries to hide the little book. Sofya, meanwhile,\n     holds up the letter in her hand.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Lyovochka?

They've offered\n                one million rubles.\n\n     Silence.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                How can you not be pleased?\n\n                          TOLSTOY\n                I don't write for publishers. I\n                write for people.\n\n     He gets up from his desk.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Where are you going?\n\n                          TOLSTOY\n                Valentin's in the library.    He's\n                asked to speak to me.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Splendid...while your wretched\n                family is left to starve.\n\n                          TOLSTOY\n                I don't see anyone starving in\n                this house. On the contrary, our\n                privilege revolts me.\n\n     He goes.   She calls after him.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                But you're always first to the\n                trough...always have been.\n\n     Sofya sinks into his chair. On the desk is the photograph\n     of herself and Tolstoy that we saw her hang on the wall in\n     the early part of the film. She looks at the wall. There\n     in it's place is the offending photograph of CHERTKOV that\n     she had removed earlier.\n\n                                                             69.\n\n\n     She can fix that. But as she picks up the photo of her and\n     her husband, she notices A SMALL VOLUME, THE SECRET DIARY,\n     lying under it. She begins to read.\n\n\n90   INT. YASNAYA POLYANA. LIBRARY.

You look\n               unhappy.

You\n               take little pieces of me until I\n               become nothing. I don't know who\n               I am anymore.\n                   (beat)\n               I read your diary.

She runs out of the\n     room. We see the shattered photograph of Chertkov.\n\n     After a moment, Tolstoy into his chair.   Valentin watches\n     him in silence.\n\n                         TOLSTOY\n               I'd like you to stay here\n               tonight.\n\n                         VALENTIN\n               Yes, of course.\n\n     With that, the old man gets up and leaves the room, leaving\n     Valentin in the wreckage of his world.\n\n\n93   EXT.

She grabs it, as if it is something that\n     might feed a terrible hunger at the center of her. Moving\n     into a corner, she tears it open and begins to read.\n\n     They both watch Sofya's passion. Her face quivers, the\n     muscles in her neck stand out. Her shoulders begin to\n     shake.\n\n     Crumbling the paper in her hand, she twists her head and\n     screams. Then, gathering up her dress, she runs out the\n     door.\n\n     Sasha move immediately to the window. From her P.O.V., we\n     see Sofya streaking across the lawn.\n\n     They look at each other\n\n                           SASHA\n               The pond!\n\n     They run out.\n\n\n\n\n99   EXT.

A\n     couple of servants join the chase, Ivan and VANYA, a fat\n     manservant. Valentin, head of the group, sees Sofya move\n     out of the birches. She's heading straight to the pond.\n\n                                                           74.\n\n\n      Sasha suddenly steams past him.\n\n                          SASHA\n                Mama, Mama!

DAY                             100\n\n      Sofya has reached the bathhouse. Peasant women watch her as\n      they do their wash. She glances back her pursuers, races\n      on.\n\n      Tiring now, she goes to her knees. She crawls along the\n      jetty toward the water. At the edge of the jetty, she\n      falls on her back then turns over, most ungracefully, and\n      rolls off sideways into the pond.\n\n\n\n      HIGH ANGLE. Sofya sinks into the black water. The sound of\n      her rescuers fades away and is replaced by Tolstoy's voice,\n      reading the farewell note she still clutches in her hand.\n\n                          TOLSTOY (V.O.)\n                My position in the house has\n                become intolerable. What I'm\n                doing now is what people have\n                commonly done - leave their\n                worldly life behind to spend\n                their last days in peace and\n                solitude.\n\n      SLOW MOTION She floats, strangely relaxed, beneath the\n      water.\n\n                          TOLSTOY (V.O.)\n                I beg you to forgive me for\n                everything I've done to you, just\n                as I forgive you with all my soul\n                for everything you've done to me.\n\n      The silence is suddenly ripped apart by the rescuers. Sasha\n      and Valentin jumping into the pond. Sasha, barely able to\n      swim herself, thrashes in the water.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                Sasha, go back to the jetty.\n                Here, let me help you.\n\n      He offers his arm, using it to push her to safety.\n\n                          SASHA\n                No! She's drowning.     Help her!\n\n                                                     75.\n\n\n                    VALENTIN\n          I will. I will. Stay here.\n\nWith that, he pushes away from the dock and makes a sharp\nplunge under the water.\n\nSasha watches, waits...and after a long moment Valentin\nsurfaces pulling Sofya with him.\n\nOn the dock, the servants and Sasha help him to get her\nheavy body , water soaked dress, back onto the bank.\n\nShe looks terrible. Her tongue lolling out, water drizzling\nfrom her open mouth. Sasha is overcome.\n\n                    SASHA\n          She's dead. My mother. She's\n          dead.\n\nIvan takes action. He rolls her on to her stomach, works to\nexpel water from her lungs. This goes on for an agonizing\nlength of time. Valentin looks to the sky... dull and gray.\n\nThen a sound, coughing sputtering. She is alive. Sasha,\nValentin, and the servants help up.\n\n                    SASHA\n          Let me take you to the house,\n          mother.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Let me die.

Ivan appears beside him.\n\n                    IVAN\n          Life returns to torture her for\n          awhile.\n\nHe laughs out loud,then walks away.\n\n                                                             76.\n\n\n101   INT.

He goes to the bedside, stops next to Dushan.\n      Silence, interrupted only by Tolstoy's incessant hiccups.\n      Valentin notices Dushan is on the verge of tears.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                What is it?

For a moment, she seems\n      overwhelmed at the sight of him. She looks at Valentin, who\n      nods at her as if to say go on. Sofya walks past Chertkov\n      without acknowledging him. Dushan lets go his hold of\n      Tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way.\n      She approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life,\n      her cross, her everything.\n\n                                                       95.\n\n\n                       SOFYA\n          Lyovochka!\n\nThere is no response.

She takes her\nhusband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          You don't speak, but I hear you.\n\nShe carries on two sides of an impossible conversation.\n\n                     SOFYA\n          \"Do you love me, Lyovochka.\"\n              (beat)\n          \"Never stopped, my little bird.\"\n              (beat)\n          \"And you will never stop\"\n              (beat)\n          \"Never.\"\n              (beat)\n          \"Nor ever leave me again.\"\n              (beat)\n          \"Never, ever again.\n              (beat)\n          \"Good...good... let's go home\"\n\n                                                        96.\n\n\nShe sits very still holding her husband's hand. Then, it\nseems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest\nsqueeze of her hand. She looks down to see Tolstoy open his\neyes. He looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile,\nthen closes his eyes again.\n\nValentin sees it, glances at Sasha.   Then, he begins to\nfight for breath.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          First cessation.\n\nA general sense of panic at the proximity of death. Tolstoy\nfights for a last breath.\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          Second cessation.\n\nSofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Please forgive me if I cry a\n          little now.\n\nTolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence.\n\nSasha starts to sob. Sofya reaches out to her daughter.\nSasha comes to her mother who holds her.\n\nShe feels someone next to her.   She looks up. It's\nChertkov.\n\n                    CHERTKOV\n          I am sorry, Sofya Andreyevna.\n\nThe most unlikely thing, she pats his hand.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          It's alright. What happens from\n          now on... it will never really\n          matter. Not really. Everything's\n          finished.\n\nChertkov sits beside them. She turns to Dushan.\n\n                    SOFYA\n          Dushan, could you tell them your\n          great friend is gone?\n\n                    DUSHAN\n          Yes.\n\nHe nods, walk out into the dawn light to tell the world Leo\nTolstoy is dead.\n\n                                                              97.\n\n\n145   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY                                  145\n\n      A sizeable crowd has assembled, the usual reporters,\n      photographers, cinematographers, but students, too, and\n      soldiers, factory workers, housewives.\n\n      Dushan faces the crowd. Quiet. Quiet.\n\n                          DUSHAN\n                At ten minutes after six in the\n                morning, a great soul passed from\n                our world. Leo Nikoleyevich\n                Tolstoy is dead.\n\n      As Dushan finishes his tribute, a single voice begins to\n      sing the old Russian hymn, Eternal Memory. Gradually, more\n      and more of the crowd picks it up. Valentin begins to sing.\n      His eyes run over the crowd of mourners. Then, something\n      stops the flow of his gaze. His eyes fill with tears.\n\n                           VALENTIN\n                Masha...\n\n      Masha. She walks slowly toward him out of the crowd. He\n      goes to her, takes her in a long embrace.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                Masha...Masha...I'm so sorry he's\n                gone. He\u00b4s gone.\n\n                          MASHA\n                Yes. Yes. I know, but I came for\n                you, Valya. I came for you, too.\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                I love you. I do. I love you.\n\n                          MASHA\n                Then, hold me. Hold me. Hold me.\n\n      The song, the voices swell around them.   They hold each\n      other like they will never let go.\n\n\n146   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY.                                 146\n\n      A black draped funeral train waits in the station. Many\n      mourners are congregated on the platform. Chertkov comes\n      out of the little house, followed by Andrey, Valentin and\n      Dushan carrying Tolstoy's coffin to the train.\n\n      Sofya appears with Sasha, who escorts her through the\n      crowd. The Orthodox priest approaches .\n\n                                                           98.\n\n\n                          ORTHODOX PRIEST\n                As a daughter of the church, I'm\n                sure you wouldn't object to my\n                saying a few words at the\n                funeral.\n\n      Sofya stares at him for a long moment.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                My husband needs no\n                justification. Besides, it\u00b4s been\n                enough talking as it is. Thank\n                you, father.\n\n      She climbs onto the train.\n\n\n147   INT. ASTAPOVO. PRIVATE CARRIAGE. DAY.                       147\n\n      Sofya settles into the comfort of the private car. She sits\n      next to Sasha. Andrey and Dushan are near her. There's a\n      noise from outside.\n\n                          VOICE (O.S.)\n                Countess...Countess.\n\n      She looks out. Below the train window, Valentin and Masha\n      stand hand in hand. She gets up and opens the window.\n\n\n148   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY.                               148\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                Excuse me, Countess. This may\n                not be the time, but-\n\n      Sofya smiles\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Valentin... and who's this...\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                Masha...this is Masha.\n\n      Sofya nods.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                This is your girl. Good. Good.\n                Is there anything I can do for\n                you?\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                No, no. Not at all. I just wanted\n                to say good bye.\n\n                           SOFYA\n                Yes...Good bye, good bye.     God\n                bless you.\n\n                                                             99.\n\n\n                          VALENTIN\n                God bless you, too.\n\n\n149   INT. ASTAPOVO. PRIVATE TRAIN. DAY                            149\n\n      Sofya sits back down with Sasha. They hold hands.\n\n                          SOFYA\n                Well, I'm ready to go now.\n                    (to Andrey)\n                Why aren\u00b4t we moving? Can't\n                someone make it move?\n\n      But at that moment, the train begins to move.\n\n                            SOFYA\n                Oh!\n\n\n150   EXT. ASTAPOVO. PLATFORM. DAY.                                150\n\n      Sofya looks out the window, sees the people lined up along\n      the rail, mourn her loss. As she looks away, we see the\n      people reflected in the glass, some of them kneel, some of\n      them remove their hats.\n\n      Valentin watches the train pull away. He holds Masha to\n      him.\n\n      As the train   moves slowly through the corridor of mourners,\n      some of them   fall in and walk behind it. The camera travels\n      up and up as   the train travels north taking Sofya and her\n      husband back   to Yasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Station, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Hoffman\u00a0\u00a0Jan Parini\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0History\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:29:05.401408"}
