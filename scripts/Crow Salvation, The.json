That Lauren\n                         and Alex were meant for each other.\n\n               REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically\n               transformed wild child.\n\n               A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes\n               that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.\n\n<b>                                     ERIN'S VOICE (CONT'D)\n</b>                         That they're together now. Fighters.\n                         United by love. And anger. That\n                         they've given also to me.\n\n               She's leaning up against a new headstone.\n\n               \"Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us.\"\n\n<b>                                     ERIN\n</b>                         I love Alex. As my sister always\n                         hoped I would. And I love Lauren.\n                         And I know, because of this, that\n                         love does not die. I'm alive.\n                         Thinking of them. Hoping that,\n                         sometimes, they're thinking of me.\n\n               Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes\n               the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,\n               like the one already over Lauren's.\n\n               She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger\n               to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.\n\n               THE END</pre>\n<b></b><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Crow Salvation, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Chip Johannessen\" title=\"Scripts by Chip Johannessen\">Chip Johannessen</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Crow Salvation, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Crow Salvation, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:02:56.865283"}
