It'll be \n                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel \n                         in the ass.  And he comes home to \n                         find that the plant he used to work \n                         at got exported to the country he \n                         just got back from. And the guy who \n                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his \n                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen \n                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. \n                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie \n                         realizes the only reason he was over \n                         there was so we could install a \n                         government that would sell us oil at \n                         a good price. And of course the oil \n                         companies used the skirmish to scare \n                         up oil prices so they could turn a \n                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary \n                         benefit for them but it ain't helping \n                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And \n                         naturally they're takin' their sweet \n                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe \n                         even took the liberty of hiring an \n                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink \n                         seven and sevens and play slalom \n                         with the icebergs and it ain't too \n                         long 'til he hits one, spills the \n                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in \n                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's \n                         out of work and he can't afford to \n                         drive so he's got to walk to the job \n                         interviews which sucks 'cause the \n                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him \n                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile \n                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he \n                         tries to get a bite to eat the only \n                         blue-plate special they're servin' \n                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker \n                         State.\n\n               A beat.\n\n<b>                                     WILL\n</b>                         So what'd I think?
