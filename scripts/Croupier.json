CASINO - NIGHT\n</b>\n               JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch: \n               2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy, \n               laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from \n               the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him.

REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the \n               casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. \n               The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes.\n\n<b>               INT.

The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his \n               fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT \n               grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, \n               knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. \n               They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER \n               tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They \n               fight, trading blows.\n\n               At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see \n               the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The \n               BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table.\n\n               TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the \n               distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start \n               screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK \n               doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, \n               pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR \n               TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a \n               hammer blow to the head.\n\n               The TWO DETECTIVES come up.
