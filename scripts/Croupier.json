We \n               now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks \n               to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's \n               jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit \n               is waiting.\n\n                                     JACK SR.\n                              (smiles)\n                         Sorry to keep you.

He \n               looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL...

Giles \n                         said three words.\n\n               JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE \n               BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment...\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still \n                         wasn't quite right...\n\n               He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN \n               THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the \n               street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls \n               in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud.\n\n                                     DRUNK'S VOICE\n                         I want to fuck the whole world \n                         over.\n\n               INT.

Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S \n               silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. \n               JACK removes his wristwatch.\n\n               INT.

CASINO - HALL - DAY\n\n               The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky \n               appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has \n               roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted \n               except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying \n               ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         There are three types of casino in \n                         the U.K. High volume.

But there wasn't enough \n                         business.

Now sort \n                         the chips.\n\n               JACK starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred \n               pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast. \n               In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Stacks of 20.

JACK quickly sets out \n               four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles \n               are in denominations of ten and five.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Very good.

He looks at the TITLES: \n               Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, \n               Self-Help, Cooking....\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Jack imagined people reading his \n                         book. One day he would enter their \n                         heads, play with their imaginations, \n                         test their feelings...\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where \n               Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are \n               scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He would tell them you have to \n                         make a choice in life. Be a gambler \n                         or a croupier. And then live with \n                         your decision come what may.\n\n               He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind \n               him.\n\n               INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               JACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of \n               street sounds and a dog barking.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Marion saw life differently. She \n                         was a romantic. And thought he was \n                         too.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral \n               version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs \n               his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase \n               of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a \n               designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is \n               a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black \n               underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to \n               the open bathroom door, from which comes the music.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               A radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away.\n\n               MARION NEIL, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing \n               a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the \n               lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She \n               sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black \n               knickers.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         I couldn't resist them.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You mean I won't resist them.\n\n               JACK goes to her.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         No, no. I'm not ready for you. \n                         There's some vodka in the freezer.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You want me drunk?\n\n                                     MARION\n                              (laughs)\n                         I won't be that long.\n\n               She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards \n               the door.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes back into the bedroom. MARION pushes the bathroom \n               door, not quite closed. JACK tosses the knickers onto the \n               bed.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               JACK takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours \n               himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food \n               neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours \n               a glass of wine.\n\n               INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK sits drinking his vodka. Looking up through the barred \n               window he sees women's legs passing on the street above. \n               On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine.\n\n               MARION materialises in the door to the bedroom. She is \n               made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black \n               shoes, a black scarf around her neck.\n\n               JACK takes the glass of wine and gives it to her.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You really are a beautiful woman.\n\n                                     MARION\n                              (pleased)\n                         It's not just inner beauty, is it?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Turn around.\n\n               MARION whirls to show off her dress.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You're all I desire.\n\n               He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to \n               her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes \n               inside.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Where did you get it?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I. sold the car.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         You shouldn't have done that.

They didn't know \n                         Jack, but he knew them.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n               A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK.\n\n                                     INDIAN\n                         Where's the other fellow?

She's \n               jealous.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                              (to Jack)\n                         What's that aftershave you're \n                         wearing?\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Never converse with the punters. \n                         It slows things down. Speed is \n                         volume, and volume is profit for \n                         the casino. Aim at twenty spins an \n                         hour.\n\n               JACK pretends he hasn't heard the question. In the \n               background REYNOLDS is watching as JACK spins the wheel.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Last bets, please.\n\n               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               Later. A plastic-looking BLONDE WOMAN, heavily made-up, \n               sits at the table. She nods to JACK. PUNTERS are placing \n               their bets. She has 50 casino chips of \u00a3100 denominations \n               in front of her. JACK notes the large sum.\n\n               The BLONDE puts \u00a32,500 on red and \u00a32,500 on black. PUNTERS \n               round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and \n               the strangeness of betting both red and black.\n\n               JACK spins the wheel. Black 10 comes up. JACK takes the \n               red loss and moves it across the table to the black win. \n               The BLONDE picks up the \u00a35,000 without a reaction and leaves \n               the table.\n\n               JACK notices that she goes straight to the cashier's desk. \n               JACK clears the chips away, starts to pay out.\n\n               A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him:\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You're new here.

She comes in \n                         once or twice a week and does that.\n\n               JACK nods.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He knew the scam. Come in with \n                         five grand cash. No questions asked. \n                         Launder it by getting a casino \n                         cheque when you cash in. Jack \n                         wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted \n                         it? After all there's was no profit \n                         in it for the casino. Or was there?\n\n               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK \n               MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks \n               around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace \n               JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious \n               complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Thank you very much, ladies and \n                         gentlemen.

You handled \n                         yourself well.\n\n               At the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man.\n\n               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               JACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5 \n               exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER \n               sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card \n               for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists \n               again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. \n               The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One \n               of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all \n               his chips, and leaves.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Suddenly a delayed wave of elation \n                         came over him.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               Across the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking \n               towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5 \n               bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Why don't you take a break, Jack.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (puzzled)\n                         All right, Mr Reynolds.\n\n               He moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR \n               TCHAI sits down, watched by the BODYGUARD.\n\n               BELLA comes up, smiles sweetly, and takes over from JACK.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Good evening, Mr Tchai.\n\n                                     MR TCHAI\n                         Good evening.\n\n               TCHAI pulls out a sealed bank packet of \u00a35,000.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Enjoy yourself, Mr Tchai.\n\n               REYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over.\n\n                                     WAITRESS\n                              (to Mr Tchai)\n                         Your usual, sir?\n\n               TCHAI nods.

Waitresses \n                         were the true winners in the casino. \n                         They were the only members of staff \n                         allowed to accept tips.

Daylight \n               illuminates the old etching of Cape Town.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               JANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned, \n               expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK \n               ten \u00a350 notes.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         In 20s, please...\n\n               He slots the cash into the \"bank\" beneath the table, then \n               counts out \u00a3500 in \u00a320 chips. He slides the chips towards \n               her, looks at her. She smiles.\n\n               There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC-\n               LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down \n               the front of her dress.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (frowns)\n                         Place your bets.\n\n               Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers, \n               lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls \n               the numbers:\n\n                                     JANI\n                         5...8...11. \n\n               JACK places them for her.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Jack could see this woman was an \n                         experienced gambler. Professionals \n                         always place their bets through \n                         the croupier. That way there are \n                         no comebacks.\n\n               The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number \n               and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays \n               out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN \n               behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him. \n               She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel \n               again. 33 comes up.\n\n               INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               JANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The \n               wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him. \n               The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI. \n               Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round \n               and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip \n               to the square. JACK clocks it.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (in Arabic accent)\n                         What are you talking about?

He comes over. The MAN is getting \n               angry. JANI watches.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Now look here, you...\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Is there a problem, sir?\n\n                                     MAN\n                         Yes.

This gentleman \n                         has been following the lady's \n                         numbers and...\n\n               The MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (to Jani)\n                         Do you think I cheated?\n\n               JACK and REYNOLDS wait.

I want to be paid.\n\n               He bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S \n               decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK.\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Pay the gentleman. In full.\n\n               REYNOLDS steps back, JACK pays out JANI and the MAN. The \n               MAN takes his winnings. He looks at JACK with hatred, then \n               leaves the table.\n\n               REYNOLDS watches him, looks to JACK and nods. JANI collects \n               her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up \n               to leave.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept \n                         gratuities in the UK.

She knew \n                         the rule of gold. Quit when you're \n                         ahead.\n\n               JANI heads towards the cashier. JACK sees REYNOLDS arguing \n               with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance.\n\n               He looks back to the table.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Place your bets.\n\n               On his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes \n               an occult sign with his hand.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK \n               tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks \n               across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table \n               the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a \n               number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S \n               winnings, quickly and efficiently.\n\n               JACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves \n               piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. \n               JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras \n               and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has \n               seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his \n               winnings and leave.\n\n               INT.

JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               In front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors. \n               He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens \n               his bow tie.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He didn't know why, but he'd started \n                         to dress for the casino at home...\n\n               INT.

CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               An ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his \u00a350 chips \n               and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks \n               round at the PUNTERS.\n\n               The ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many \n               groans.\n\n               A MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A \n               gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that \n               JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is \n               appalled.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Animal!\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Would you mind being more careful, \n                         sir.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         I've got 'flu.\n\n               He coughs again, but into a handkerchief.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Then go back home. To the zoo!\n\n               JACK clears the piles of chips to one side. He signals to \n               a SUPERVISOR. The SUPERVISOR hurries over.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         This gentleman accidentally coughed \n                         onto these chips. I don't think it \n                         would be hygienic to stack them...\n\n               The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over.\n\n                                     SUPERVISOR\n                         Agnes.

CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               The last PUNTERS are leaving. The overhead lights come on. \n               A CROUPIER is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of \n               chips. TWO MEN are covering the tables with shrouds.\n\n               INT. CASINO - STRONG ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               REYNOLDS watches as JACK and MATT count the thousands of \n               pounds, putting them in piles.

CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               JACK, comes out. BELLA hurries after him, following him \n               round the corner.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                              (calling)\n                         Jack.

BELLA walks the other \n               way.\n\n               EXT. STREET. NIGHT\n\n               A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see \n               him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S \n               way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught \n               cheating at the casino with JANI.\n\n                                     MAN\n                         You don't recognise me?

He yanks it \n               with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S \n               chest.\n\n               The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN \n               leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin.\n\n               The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse \n               struggling onto the pavement.\n\n               A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees \n               the fight.\n\n               JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back. \n               JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Now I'm going to kill you.\n\n               He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car \n               and runs over to them.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Jack!\n\n               The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA \n               pulls JACK away.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Jack. Leave him! Come on!\n\n               JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is \n               frightened by JACK'S violence.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Let's go. We don't want the cops \n                         here.\n\n               Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the \n               MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand. \n               BELLA is shocked.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (coldly)\n                         He won't cheat again.\n\n               BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in, \n               drives away.\n\n               INT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Water is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on \n               the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes \n               his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         You're shaking.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It's the tension.\n\n               She undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes \n               his torso, cleans him up.\n\n               JACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the \n               hand, leads him into the bedroom.\n\n               INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               She sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured \n               lamps.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Excuse the mess.\n\n               JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the \n               bed. She is startled.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Careful.\n\n               JACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast. \n               BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily, \n               his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side \n               zip in her skirt.\n\n                                     BELLA\n                         Don't tear anything.\n\n               BELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion \n               between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence \n               with the MAN on the street.\n\n               For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks \n               over the bedside lamp.\n\n               JACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down. \n               He rips her black underwear away.\n\n               INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Later. JACK is lying sprawled on the bed with BELLA.

COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - STAIRS - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas, wearing his \n               hat. He walks slowly down the passage. He hears the sounds \n               of love-making coming from one of the rooms. He passes \n               'The Raft of the Medusa' as he goes down the stairs.\n\n               INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes into the kitchen, switches on the light. He \n               goes to the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of vodka. He \n               washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Jack wondered why he was even \n                         considering it. Ten grand. In cash. \n                         That was why. But Jack didn't need \n                         the money. His father would have \n                         taken it, like a shot. But his \n                         father was a gambler.\n\n               He downs his drink, and leaves the kitchen.\n\n               INT.

There is silence now, no sounds \n               of sex.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He was always broke.

COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes in, tosses his hat on the bed. JANI isn't in \n               the bed. The bathroom door is afar. He hears the sounds of \n               gasping. He rushes to the bathroom.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JANI is holding her head over the lavatory bowl. JACK runs \n               some water in the basin. He helps her to her feet and gives \n               her a glass of water.\n\n               She washes out her mouth. She looks at him, tears running \n               down her face.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         I want you to forget what I said.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Wait a minute...\n\n                                     JANI\n                         No, forget it.

Can he \n                         help?\n\n               She spits the water out of her mouth, kisses him on the \n               forehead and goes back into the bedroom. JACK looks at his \n               reflection in the bathroom mirror. He strokes his hair \n               down.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Why don't you just go back to South \n                         Africa?\n\n               He leaves the bathroom.\n\n               INT.

She asked \n                         me to thank you.\n\n                                     GILES\n                         A bit unexpected, wasn't it?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Not entirely.\n\n                                     GILES\n                         How's that football story corning \n                         along?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You said it was going to be social, \n                         Giles. No business.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He was overcome with a sense of \n                         urgency. He had to get it down... \n                         Chapter Five.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes in, puts down his overnight bag. He yawns, heads \n               for the bedroom. Suddenly, he sees that the vase of dead \n               flowers is now full of fresh blooms. Underneath is a small \n               box, gift-wrapped. JACK opens it. Inside the tissue paper \n               is a tiny gold charm on a chain. He examines it.\n\n               CLOSE-UP: The charm is a book, no title engraved.\n\n               JACK is touched.\n\n               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes into the room. MARION is in bed asleep. He looks \n               at her, smiles.\n\n               He starts to get undressed. MARION stirs. JACK puts the \n               book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to \n               one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the \n               charm.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It's beautiful. Thank you.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         I hope it brings you luck.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It will.\n\n               MARION I haven't brought you much luck, have I? Perhaps we \n               shouldn't be together.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         That girl, she works at the casino --\n\n                                     MARION\n                         -- I don't care about her. Of \n                         course, I was angry. But not with \n                         you. The book is yours not mine. I \n                         was wrong, what I said about it. I \n                         hurt you, didn't I?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You're entitled to your opinion.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         It's none of my business what you \n                         write. And your job, that's none \n                         of my business either. I love you. \n                         And I've done everything wrong.\n\n               JACK takes her in his arms.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I'll leave the casino soon.\n                              (he strokes her \n                              hair)\n                         I promise.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         You will?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Within a month. Believe me, I'm \n                         going to quit!\n\n               They begin to make love. She holds the back of his head.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Then you can dye your hair blond \n                         again.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               JACK is asleep in bed with MARION. He is murmuring \n               indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches \n               his shoulder. He opens his eyes.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         What?\n\n                                     MARION\n                         You were talking in your sleep.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Not talking. Writing.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY\n\n               JACK is at work alone. The phone rings. He leaves it and \n               continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE.\n\n                                     JANI'S VOICE\n                         I need to see you. I've moved. I \n                         have a new number. It's 468-3275. \n                         Please call me.\n\n               There is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes \n               work.\n\n               INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT\n\n               JACK gets off a train. He is dressed as a croupier. He \n               walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S \n               note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of \n               the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The \n               phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I want to speak to Jani de \n                         Villiers...\n                              (waits)\n                         Jani... it's Jack... I'll come \n                         over now...\n\n               He takes out a notepad and writes down the address.\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               JACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The \n               street lamps are on.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Chapter Seven... Jack had decided \n                         to see her. The challenge was \n                         essential.\n\n               He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in.\n\n               INT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT\n\n               JACK climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent \n               lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's \n               pajamas. She looks unslept.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Come in.\n\n               She glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in.\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JANI carefully closes the door. JACK looks round the dingy \n               room.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         It's not the Ritz this time.\n\n               She switches on a standard lamp, looks at him.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Is it yes?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Thank you.\n\n               Reflected in a mirror, she opens her bag and takes out an \n               envelope, gives it to JACK. He looks inside. Four bank \n               packets of \u00a32500.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It doesn't seem fair. You're \n                         offering me ten grand in cash but \n                         you can't afford a decent place.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Well, life's not fair. We know \n                         that.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It's all relative.  I need the \n                         money too.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Do you?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         The date's not set yet. I'll call \n                         you. One last thing: the man you're \n                         going to catch cheating, he may \n                         get violent. But you know how to \n                         deal with cheats.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (looks at her face)\n                         That bruise has cleared up nicely.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Bruise?\n                              (touches her eye)\n                         Oh, yes. It's better.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (touches his chest)\n                         I've still got mine.\n\n               JACK looks at her hand.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         And your hand too.\n\n                                     JANI\n                              (coolly)\n                         I took the bandage off yesterday.\n\n               She crosses to pick up a bottle of Scotch.\n\n                                     JANI\n                         Would you like a drink?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         No thank you.\n\n               JACK puts the envelope in his pocket. They look at each \n               other.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         I don't think we should meet again.\n\n                                     JANI\n                              (nods)\n                         It's a shame there aren't more men \n                         in the world like you.\n\n               JACK goes up to JANI and kisses her on the mouth. She puts \n               an arm around him.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         There was a part of Jani he really \n                         liked.\n\n               He turns and leaves the room.\n\n               EXT. HOTEL - STREET - NIGHT\n\n               JACK comes out of the hotel, walks up the street.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Question: Was he gambling, taking \n                         Jani's money? Answer: No. Because \n                         he wasn't betting with his own \n                         money. He was being paid in advance \n                         for a service...\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               At the roulette table JACK spins the wheel, throws the \n               ball.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         In reality there were two clear \n                         elements of risk in this exchange. \n                         One: the possibility the cash was \n                         counterfeit. Two: the possibility \n                         Jani or her creditors would want \n                         the money back if the plan failed.\n\n               A MIDDLE-AGED MAN is sweating. He fingers his last 2 chips. \n               He reaches for a number, hesitates. JACK sees that the \n               MAN's hand is shaking.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         To begin with he put the odds at 2 \n                         against. 7 for. He checked a random \n                         selection of bills at a bank. They \n                         were all good.\n\n               Across the table a well-dressed JEWISH WOMAN in her fifties \n               is sitting next to a YOUNG MAN, a gigolo type, the top \n               three buttons of his shirt undone. She too hesitates with \n               her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty \n               turns.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         So now his odds were decidedly \n                         better. He put them at 8 to 1. The \n                         fact that the notes were good gave \n                         him one less negative. 2 minus 1. \n                         At the same time mathematically he \n                         had one more positive. 7 plus 1.\n\n               The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the \n               chip.\n\n                                     WOMAN\n                         Bring me some luck.\n\n               The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21.\n\n               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays \n               silently.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of \n               numbers.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         No more bets.\n\n               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her \n               hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Next stage. He had to be secure at \n                         8 to 1 against having to give the \n                         money back, so he wouldn't spend \n                         it. If after one month no one had \n                         approached him, he calculated the \n                         odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. \n                         After three months he figured 100 \n                         to 1 no one would turn up.\n\n               The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. \n               She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing \n               her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in \n               her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure.\n\n               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of \n               misery on his face.\n\n               JACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor \n               winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides \n               them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he \n               prepares to pay out the WOMAN.\n\n               No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The \n               MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. \n               The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK.\n\n               The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile \n               of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck.\n\n                                     YOUNG MAN\n                         How about a drink to celebrate?\n\n               The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, \n               relief.\n\n                                     MAN\n                              (to Jack)\n                         Cash me in.\n\n               JACK converts the green coloured chips to \u00a335 in house \n               chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally.\n\n               The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the \n               next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette \n               table.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Jake's experiment with the man \n                         would prove the point.\n\n               The MAN hesitates. He can't resist.\n\n               In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         People don't change.\n\n               INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               MARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes. She swears \n               and bends to pick up the pieces.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry \n               basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest \n               of drawers for another. She can't find one among the \n               underwear.\n\n               She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She \n               unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of \u00a32500.\n\n               She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously.\n\n               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT\n\n               JACK pushes several \u00a350 notes into the slot and counts out \n               two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He watched their faces as they \n                         lost hour after hour, night after \n                         night, relentlessly.\n\n               JACK'S FACE as he deals.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         He questioned the conventional \n                         wisdom that gamblers are self-\n                         destructive...\n\n               INT.

Jake stayed.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n               MARION is lying awake alone in bed. The phone rings. She \n               leans over to pick it up, then doesn't. From the sitting \n               room comes the message:\n\n                                     JANI'S VOICE\n                         It's set.

Then \n               carefully she presses the ERASE button, wiping the message. \n               She goes back into the bedroom.\n\n               INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY\n\n               JACK is at work. MARION'S hands are massaging his shoulders. \n               The little book charm dangles round his neck.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (looks up)\n                         Never.

UNDERGROUND - NIGHT\n\n               JACK sits impassively among noisy Christmas TRAVELLERS. \n               The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and \n               alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the \n               crowd.\n\n               INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               JACK hangs up his hat and coat, examines himself in the \n               mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it. \n               A Christmas party hat.\n\n                                     JACK'S VOICE\n                         Chapter Twelve...\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               A Christmas festive atmosphere. The casino interior is \n               decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold \n               streamers, a large tree hung with \u00a31000 chips.\n\n               JACK is dealing at a blackjack table. Like the other \n               croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat \n               with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat.\n\n               The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four \n               expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind \n               them. They are gambling big money. Wads of \u00a350 notes are \n               changed into \u00a3100 chips.\n\n               JACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on \n               impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS \n               are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his \n               friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they \n               show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare \n               to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the \n               box beneath the table.\n\n               REYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which \n               is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a \n               short break the money is taken from under the table in a \n               box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away.\n\n               INT. CASINO - BAR - NIGHT\n\n               TWO COLD-LOOKING MEN in suits are drinking mineral water \n               at the bar. They watch the SECURITY MAN with the cart pass \n               by and disappear through a green baize door marked PRIVATE.  \n               One of the SUITS looks at his watch: five minutes to \n               midnight.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch: \n               2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy, \n               laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from \n               the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him. The \n               SUIT throws him \u00a3500.\n\n                                     SUIT\n                         Fifties. Ten of them.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         What colour chips?\n\n                                     SUIT\n                         Whatever.\n\n               JACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale \n               blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours \n               used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and \n               talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the \n               casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. \n               The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight \n               from the winners, 5 is heavily covered.\n\n               The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number \n               at the side.\n\n               JACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (stiffens)\n                         Sir, I can't accept that bet.\n\n               The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK.\n\n                                     SUIT\n                         Are you calling me a cheat?\n\n                                     PUNTER\n                         You are a cheat. I saw you.\n\n                                     SUIT\n                              (grabbing Jack's \n                              lapel)\n                         I'm talking to you.\n\n               JACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his \n               fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT \n               grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, \n               knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. \n               They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER \n               tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They \n               fight, trading blows.\n\n               At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see \n               the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The \n               BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table.\n\n               TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the \n               distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start \n               screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK \n               doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, \n               pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR \n               TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a \n               hammer blow to the head.\n\n               The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, \n               who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A \n               strange, violent Christmas party.\n\n               INT. CASINO - NIGHT\n\n               JACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing, \n               watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy \n               system:\n\n                                     REYNOLDS\n                         Ladies and gentlemen, please be \n                         calm. There's no cause for alarm. \n                         Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.\n\n               REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph \n               the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid \n               the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other \n               CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD.\n\n               INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT\n\n               JACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain \n               drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has \n               two large plasters on his chest.\n\n               The NURSE finishes the job, smiles.\n\n                                     NURSE\n                         There you go.\n\n               She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the \n               background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK \n               fingers the charm around his neck.\n\n               There is a pause.
