ROOF, COPLEY PLAZA HOTEL - DAY\n\n               Amelia in a flying outfit.   Hands on her hips as if posing.\n\n                                   AMELIA (V.O.)\n                         There's a Beatrix Potter story\n                         about a cat named Simpkin.\n               PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They\n               are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston.\n\n          \n\n                    T\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              A\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                                                     17.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                              AMELIA (V.O.)\n                    He wasn't happy unless he had\n                    several mice, each under a\n                    different teacup. So he could\n                    never become bored.\n          We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo\n          of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is\n          labeled `LUCKY LINDY.'\n\n                              AMELIA (V.O.)\n                    THe illusion of activity was\n                    essential for him to feel at peace.\n          The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh\n          in a different pose.\n\n                              AMELIA\n                    What are you boys doing over there?\n\n                              GEORGE\n                    Trying to make you look like a\n                    girl.\n          George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins\n          moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to\n          Lindbergh's angle.\n\n                                  MELIA (V.O.)\n                    I wondered.     Was I Mr. Putnam's\n                    43rd mouse?     Or his 307th.\n          Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her\n          hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...\n\n                               G\n\n                               EORGE\n                     he more we can make you look\n                    like a girl, the better.\n\n                              AMELIA\n                    Oh god, is it worth the effort?\n          He cocks his head, studies her.    Nah, guess not.\n\n                              GEORGE\n                    Wondering who should play you\n                    in the film of all this. I'm\n                    thinking Chaplin.\n\n                              AMELIA\n                    Valentino's not available?\n          He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more.\n          This time, his hands linger.\n\n          \n\n                                                                         18.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n                                   AMELIA (CONT'D)\n                         Two things. One, Chaplin can't\n                         play me because he's perfect for\n                         you. And two, you have company.\n               She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is\n               being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her.\n               He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her\n               tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them\n               both.\n\n                                   GEORGE\n                         Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy\n                         Binney Putnam.\n               The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye\n               contact.\n\n                                   DOROTHY\n                         Great to meet you.

And another.\n\n                                   PHOTOGRAPHER\n                         Hold those smiles for one more,\n                         please.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n               EXT.

George and Amelia alone at the\n               railing. She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots.\n               They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward.
