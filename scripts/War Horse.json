We fly\r\n          low over the high, thick hedges untouched for hundreds of\r\n          years. The thick verdant countryside in all its splendor,\r\n          ancient woodlands, fields of corn, and finally a paddock in a\r\n          typical Devonshire dale.\r\n                         \r\n          We come to rest beside three farmers standing over a pregnant\r\n          mare. The mare is in distress - she is about to give birth.\r\n          The farmers calm the mare and tend to her gently with\r\n          assurance and authority.\r\n                         \r\n          We pull back to see, ALBERT, a fifteen-year-old farm boy,\r\n          watching the whole drama with delight from the paddock gate.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          FARMER\r\n</b>           Come on, easy, girl.

Who's a clever girl?\r\n                         \r\n          Moments later - the summer's sun glints off the wet, sticky\r\n          hide of the foal (JOEY) - red hide, four white socks and a\r\n          distinctive white cross on its forehead.\r\n                         \r\n          Soon the creature is attempting its first clumsy steps. It is\r\n          both awesome and comical to see the new born creature\r\n          struggle to his feet, but eventually, he succeeds.\r\n          Title: WAR HORSE\r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. PADDOCK/FIELD, DEVON. VARIOUS.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          We follow Joey's progress over the course of his first year.\r\n          His initial fearfulness, his connection with his mother, the\r\n          intimacy of their relationship.\r\n                         \r\n          As Joey gets strong they run together, frolicking gayly in\r\n          the last dregs of summer. Albert looking on. Joey notices him\r\n          at the fence and they share a moment of connection.\r\n                         \r\n          Spring: flowers are beginning to sprout by the hedgerows. Our\r\n          boy Albert runs into the field. He takes an apple from his\r\n          pocket - he holds it out tentatively. Joey approaches Albert\r\n          with suspicion. Albert gently encourages him.\r\n<b>           2.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          His mother paws the ground and neighs at Joey. He turns and\r\n          runs over the field at her beck and call.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert tosses the apple to himself, ruefully - watches in awe\r\n          as Joey races away with his mother.\r\n                         \r\n          He is a magnificent one year old. His distinctive red coat\r\n          gleaming, now it is clear that he is half thoroughbred. He\r\n          runs quickly around the field enjoying his own power and\r\n          strength.\r\n                         \r\n          Later - the three farmers open the gate and come into the\r\n          field. Both Joey and his mother instinctively canter over to\r\n          the two men, expecting food. The three men gently greet the\r\n          horses and pet them, then we see one man has a noose made of\r\n          a rope. He slips it round Mum's neck. She pulls back, Joey is\r\n          shaken and bewildered but before he knows what's happening\r\n          the second farmer is trying to get a similar rope around his\r\n          neck. Joey balks and pushes the farmer aside, distressed to\r\n          see his mother tethered. The farmer grabs Joey again and\r\n          struggles with him, enlisting the help of the second farmer.\r\n          With some effort they get the rope around his neck and calm\r\n          him down.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          FARMER 2\r\n</b>           Easy does it.

They gently lead Joey and his\r\n          mother across the field to the gate and out into the road.\r\n                         \r\n          The whole road becomes overtaken by a flock of sheep on their\r\n          way to the market. In the distance we hear the bustle of\r\n          Market Day.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT. THE MARKET.

They find themselves amongst\r\n          a hoard of pigs, sheep and cows. Joey is agog at all of these\r\n          creatures and all this life he had no idea existed.\r\n                         \r\n          The farmers lead the horses into a stall to await the\r\n          auction. Joey is bewildered by all the noise - buttressed\r\n          against a couple of mules and a cow. He is uncomfortable in\r\n          this tight space.\r\n                         \r\n          An AUCTION WORKER holds a clipboard out for the lead farmer.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          AUCTION MAN 1\r\n</b>           Mornin', pop.

Suddenly\r\n          there is a look of horror on his face. His terrified mother\r\n          realises they are being separated. Joey panics and\r\n          desperately tries to get back to his mother, he rises up\r\n          throwing the man who is leading him aside. Joey is out of\r\n          control.

Just behind Si is his 15 year\r\n          old son, ANDREW. Ted has a drink in his hand.

Albert hanging on for dear life.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert and Joey pull up beside a sleek red car. It's Lyons'\r\n          car, being driven by David Lyons, every inch the expensively-\r\n          tailored rural gentry.\r\n<b>           29.\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          DAVID\r\n</b>           Um, I'm the only boy that drives in\r\n           the village.

Forgetting\r\n          himself momentarily, Albert stares at her, dazzled.

The sound of the acceleration and Albert's\r\n          eagerness to impress the young woman make Joey go faster, and\r\n          again he moves out ahead of the car. The young woman grins\r\n          at Albert.\r\n                         \r\n          Up ahead Albert sees that the wall alongside of which he's\r\n          been racing turns the corner, presenting him and Joey with an\r\n          obstacle.

Then suddenly three hundred men seem to rise out of\r\n          it. They are in fact our soldiers, mounting their horses -\r\n          but the horses are invisible in the height of the grass.\r\n                         \r\n          Stewart gives a signal. We see the intense anticipation on\r\n          his face. He takes out his sabre.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          MAJOR STEWART\r\n</b>           Draw swords!\r\n          The men draw their sabres in silence.

Canter...march!\r\n                         \r\n          The men start to float over the grass - swept along by their\r\n          invisible horses, until...\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly they emerge from the tall grass - the immense power\r\n          of the galloping horses - silence explodes into a violent\r\n          crashing of hooves. The noise is immense, swords are flying\r\n          in the air. Hundreds of horses racing towards the German\r\n          encampment.\r\n                         \r\n          On the German side, TWO SOLDIERS wake to the sound of\r\n          hoofbeats. They pull their tent flap aside to find the\r\n          invincible charge coming towards them. The Germans are\r\n          totally unprepared. We see them scramble back towards tents,\r\n          rush towards their guns - one man pulling up his trousers\r\n          rushes for cover. One German drops some dirty dishes into a\r\n          wash pot, screaming:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN SOLDIER\r\n</b>           Kavallerie!\r\n                         \r\n          Topthorn and Joey race each other like a rerun of their\r\n          practice on Salisbury Plain. The swords and uniforms glint in\r\n          the sun, the German troops look terrified - some run in\r\n          panic, others prepare to stand their ground.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          CAPTAIN NICHOLLS\r\n</b><b>           CHARGE!\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The British head in for the kill, the men scream battle cries\r\n          with sheer exhilaration.\r\n                         \r\n          We see the horses at close quarters running with all their\r\n          might. Nicholls and Stewart yell as they approach the enemy.\r\n          The surprise attack is a huge success. The first row of\r\n          unprepared Germans are falling...\r\n                         \r\n          The regiment sweeps through the encampment, cutting down\r\n          soldiers and driving the rest in a panicked retreat to the\r\n          tree line.\r\n                         \r\n          But then we see, in the shadows of the forest behind the\r\n<b>                         CAMP --\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A machine gun. No, a line of machine guns - at least twenty\r\n          guns, sandbagged apart - the logical, new, modern defence of\r\n          a garrison. In an instant, the fleeing Germans have manned\r\n          the guns. All now firing.\r\n<b>           48.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The noise of the blast of bullets drowns out everything else.\r\n          A score of men and horses are suddenly on the ground, it\r\n          happens almost so quickly Joey and Topthorn don't realize\r\n          anything's wrong and find themselves racing straight towards\r\n          the guns. The bullets keep coming, now suddenly half of the\r\n          regiment are on the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          Horse after horse races past the guns into the woods...all of\r\n          them now riderless.\r\n                         \r\n          Nicholls watches helplessly as one of the barrels swings\r\n          towards him. His face goes slack as he realizes he is about\r\n          to die.\r\n                         \r\n          A moment later, Joey runs on - we pan up to see he is running\r\n          on riderless - he has not realized that Nicholls is gone. The\r\n          bullets whizz around his head, but he still runs directly\r\n          ahead. We would always know him by the red pennant Nicholls\r\n          tied on his saddle.\r\n                         \r\n          Joey is now running through the German lines. No one bothers\r\n          to attack him as the German's concentrate their efforts on\r\n          the cavalry behind him. The line of machine guns fire as one,\r\n          decimating the horses and their riders.\r\n                         \r\n          Joey leaps and dances nimbly through the German ranks, but\r\n          suddenly rears up in the confusion, surrounded by Germans.\r\n                         \r\n          Near him, surviving English officers are hauled from their\r\n          horses.\r\n                         \r\n          Stewart wheels back around on Topthorn, sabre in hand. But\r\n          he, too, is quickly surrounded by several Germans with their\r\n          rifles trained on him. A furious GERMAN OFFICER storms over,\r\n          speaks perfect English:\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b><b>                          (OUTRAGED)\r\n</b>           What?

The\r\n          Germans take Stewart from Topthorn.\r\n                         \r\n          Around them, the fields are littered with dead soldiers and\r\n          horses.\r\n<b>           49.\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

Suddenly, he\r\n          rears up and bolts from his new German handler, galloping\r\n          over to Joey. The horses briefly nuzzle, but both rear up\r\n          again as they are separated and led past a young German\r\n          soldier, GUNTHER.\r\n                         \r\n          He zeroes in on them, the finest horses.\r\n                         \r\n          A slightly more JUNIOR OFFICER approaches the outraged senior\r\n          officer.\r\n                         \r\n<b>           JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER.\r\n</b>           What do we do with the horses?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           If they're injured, shoot them.\r\n<b>           JUNIOR GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           And the others, sir?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           The others you round up and take to\r\n           base camp - they will pull guns.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          THIRD OFFICER\r\n</b>           You'll never get fancy horses like\r\n           these to pull guns.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           Then shoot them also.\r\n                         \r\n          Gunther, the young private, now standing behind them,\r\n          interjects.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GUNTHER\r\n</b>           Sir - perhaps we could use some of\r\n           them with the ambulances - to get\r\n           the injured men off the field.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           Will they take the harness?\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GUNTHER\r\n</b>           I'd like to try, sir.\r\n                         \r\n          The officers move away - that's enough talk about horses...\r\n                         \r\n          CUT ON - Gunther is now with Joey and Topthorn.

And instinct for\r\n          survival.\r\n                         \r\n          He sniffs the harness and places his head through it, which\r\n          helps to calm Topthorn enough that Gunther can slip the\r\n          collar onto the big black horse. Gunther turns to Joey,\r\n          impressed.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GUNTHER\r\n</b>           Well, well, look at you.

These soldiers moving into\r\n          the darkness and towards death. Gunther looks on - tears in\r\n          his eyes. The two horses are uneasy - sensing tension.\r\n                         \r\n          A few minutes later - Gunther grabs a saddle and throws it\r\n          onto Joey's back.\r\n                         \r\n          Back to the soldiers.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly we see the galloping legs of two horses. They whip\r\n          past the back of the line of marching soldiers. It's clear\r\n          what is happening - Gunther is on Topthorn - and has hold of\r\n          Joey, on a loose rope, galloping beside him.\r\n                         \r\n          Gunther, galloping along the line of soldiers, spots what he\r\n          is looking for, a red pennant unfurled and flapping in the\r\n          wind, tied onto Michael's pack. Gunther speeds toward him.\r\n          This was his plan all along. And in an instant he is beside\r\n          him and without Michael ever realizing, he suddenly finds his\r\n          arms and legs akimbo, as he is yanked out of the line and\r\n          dragged along the ground, desperately close to Joey's\r\n          pounding hooves.\r\n                         \r\n          Michael looks at the soldiers beside him - he looks at the\r\n          skyline of violence ahead...but before he can decide, he\r\n          feels his brother's arm - pulling him upwards. And now, the\r\n          two of them are fully on Topthorn.\r\n                         \r\n          They leave a jumble of soldiers in their wake as the officers\r\n          try to restore order.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           Get back in line!

They see a very dilapidated windmill. They\r\n          aim for it as the sun begins to seriously break over the\r\n          horizon.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          INT. / EXT.

These are several tons of cast iron - almost\r\n          dwarfing the horses. Friedrich notices. Together, this grim\r\n          circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the\r\n          rain.\r\n<b>           75.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense\r\n          effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It\r\n          is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose\r\n          ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and\r\n          although he almost loses his balance several times he stays\r\n          upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the\r\n          hill.\r\n                         \r\n          We follow his progress step by step. Friedrich watches\r\n          anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One\r\n          throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they\r\n          reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too\r\n          much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back. Joey\r\n          finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the\r\n          tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the\r\n          cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill.\r\n                         \r\n<b>          EXT.

And then from another.\r\n          And another. For the first time we see the big picture - the\r\n          line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny\r\n          part.\r\n<b>           76.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into\r\n          oblivion - as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded -\r\n          the noise is deafening - the line seemingly endless - an\r\n          obscene production line of death. This is what the horses\r\n          have been feeding - this massive merciless thing.\r\n                         \r\n          Smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the\r\n          distance.

Gun fire overhead,\r\n          Albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top,\r\n          followed by the next man and the next.\r\n<b>           81.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the\r\n          screams of the first men who are shot. We follow Albert.\r\n                         \r\n          We are him. His vision. His experience. The ground is\r\n          blasted, there are bodies all around him. He tries to run but\r\n          his feet sink into the mud. Bullets fly past him. Felled men\r\n          are screaming at his feet in fear and agony. Albert staggers\r\n          forward. David is now right by him. They run together. Albert\r\n          looks round and suddenly, David is hit.

Shells\r\n          explode around them as they stumble on. Other men are\r\n          running and falling. Albert sees cover in a huge shell-hole\r\n          so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire.\r\n          He sits in still terror for a moment.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ALBERT\r\n</b>           You'll be all right here.

Then\r\n          a third. They suddenly catch sight of Andrew waiting there\r\n          with his gun pointed towards them. They slow down - in the\r\n          terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was\r\n          waiting for them if they turned back.\r\n<b>           82.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Time seems to slow down - Andrew shifts his gun from pointing\r\n          at one - to the other - we see their individual faces. They\r\n          are all just boys really.\r\n                         \r\n          And suddenly, instinct hits Andrew - he charges up the\r\n          ladder, and forward, firing - past the three men, towards the\r\n          enemy. He chooses his death instead of theirs. A sudden\r\n          barrage of machine gun fire all around him.\r\n                         \r\n          Cut back to Albert, who makes his way to the edge of the\r\n          shell hole. Bullets whizz inches from his head. He looks over\r\n          to see a German machine gun position to his right. Bullets\r\n          whizz past forcing him to duck.\r\n                         \r\n          Andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          RANDOM SOLDIER\r\n</b>           Get down!\r\n          Albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole,\r\n          nearer to the German line. He scrambles from shell hole to\r\n          shell hole. Now he's very close to the machine gun position.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands\r\n          tremble. He finally gets the pin out and he hurls the\r\n          grenade at the machine gunner. We see the explosion and the\r\n          machine gun stop. Albert sprints over the top again and makes\r\n          it all the way into the German trench.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty.\r\n          Albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas-\r\n          masked German holding a rifle on him.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped\r\n          backwards against the side of the trench still upright.\r\n          Albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him,\r\n          ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead\r\n          German soldiers.\r\n                         \r\n          Albert is alone, everyone else is dead.

He stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers\r\n          it, and races through the trench.\r\n                         \r\n          He glimpses Albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist.\r\n          Andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting\r\n          Albert to whirl with his rifle raised.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          ANDREW\r\n</b><b>           NO!\r\n</b><b>           83.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Albert pauses just in time.

For\r\n          a moment we think Topthorn will come round but he slips away\r\n          and all life leaves his body.

Chaos - all the German\r\n          soldiers stream back past their position, scrambling to get\r\n          their guns and helmets. An officer charges down the bank next\r\n          to the bridge, screaming orders at Friedrich.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GERMAN OFFICER\r\n</b>           They're coming!

He paws at the ground next to\r\n          Topthorn, a horse standing over his best friend in a field,\r\n          and he will never leave him.\r\n                         \r\n          And then suddenly - from around a blind turn in the\r\n          streambed, a huge, remorseless tank turns, heading right for\r\n          Joey. He bolts, galloping down the streambed, until he\r\n          reaches a barbed wire barrier - a dead end. He attempts to\r\n          run up the banks, but they're blocked, as well. He rears up,\r\n          but the tank keeps advancing.\r\n                         \r\n          The tank is about to crush Joey. He has left it too late.

Then\r\n          scrambles up and over it and leaps down behind.\r\n                         \r\n          Joey keeps on running.

He is suddenly in the thick of battle. A shell\r\n          explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench.\r\n          Another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough - he\r\n          finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench - and he\r\n          races through it - and finds himself charging towards a\r\n          German company.

When Geordie gets\r\n          too close, Joey freaks out and begins thrashing about. Joey\r\n          whinnies a high scream of pain, because wire is cutting into\r\n          his hide in several places, and as he thrashes it cuts him\r\n          deeper. Particularly worrisome is a strand that's wrapped\r\n          around his head, crossing right over his eye, threatening to\r\n          slash it.

The Geordie soothes and at the same\r\n          time gingerly tests other strands, trying to figure out where\r\n          to begin.\r\n<b>           90.\r\n</b>                         \r\n<b>                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           Bugger me worthless - I didn't think\r\n           to bring gloves or something to cut\r\n<b>                          THE -\r\n</b>                         \r\n          He stabs his hand on one of the barbs.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          GEORDIE (CONT'D)\r\n</b><b>           OW!

He tries\r\n          to figure out where to begin cutting. He lifts a long strand\r\n          of wire that wraps around Joey's neck, stretches across his\r\n          shoulder and torso and around one of his front legs.

THE SAME.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Ted sees them and makes his way to the field gate...shaky.\r\n          Albert approaches, and stops a slight distance away.\r\n                         \r\n          Ted opens the gate to stand before his son. Albert slips\r\n          something from his pocket and lets it unfurl in his hand -\r\n          Ted's campaign pennant.\r\n                         \r\n          Ted accepts it quietly, then offers his hand to Albert. They\r\n          shake, as men. And then slowly embrace, as father and son.\r\n<b>           109.\r\n</b>                         \r\n          Mrs. Narracott joins them as Joey looks on - a small family\r\n          and a beautiful horse, finally home.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          THE END\r\n</b>\r\n\r\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/War-Horse.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>War Horse</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Lee Hall\" title=\"Scripts by Lee Hall\">Lee Hall</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Richard Curtis\" title=\"Scripts by Richard Curtis\">Richard Curtis</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/War\" title=\"War Scripts\">War</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/War Horse Script.html#comments\" title=\"War Horse comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:19:26.577251"}
