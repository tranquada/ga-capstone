Even more important to establish than \n               the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters \n               would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes \n               as \"Burst the Roosevelt Bubble,\" \"Save the American Way of \n               Life,\" \"Vote for Landon and Knox.\"\n\n<b>               EXT. FACTORY - DAY\n</b>\n               One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket \n               line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is \n               anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct \n               conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance \n               open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a \n               small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this \n               that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets \n               or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction \n               pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.\n\n<b>               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n</b>\n               A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault \n               them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, \n               dirty and noisy.\n\n<b>               INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD\n</b>\n               The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are \n               clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the \n               SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening \n               on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER \n               of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                         Somebody shut the goddam window. Let \n                         a man think.\n\n               The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also \n               owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. \n               Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table \n               look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, \n               extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself \n               the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid \n               have almost all the money on the table between them, about a \n               hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more \n               than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, \n               there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are \n               left in the hand.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                         Possible straight gets a --\n                              (deals the card)\n                         -- lovely little four.\n\n<b>                                     FIRST PLAYER\n</b>                         On the last hand even, you couldn't \n                         give me a break.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                         I put the brakes on your straight, \n                         didn't I?\n                              (he laughs; no one \n                              else does; he deals \n                              to The Kid)\n                         There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.\n\n<b>                                     KID\n</b>                         Thanks.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                              (deals to Danny)\n                         And our lucky friend from Chicago \n                         gets a queen with his pair of sixes. \n                         Little lady make you happy, Buster?\n\n<b>                                     DANNY\n</b>                         Deal to yourself, clown.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                         Dealer gives himself a --\n                              (deals card and groans)\n                         I might have known.\n                              (to Danny)\n                         Bet your sixes, Buster.\n\n<b>                                     DANNY\n</b>                         I told you not to call me that.\n                              (then as the dealer \n                              turns away)\n                         Cost you --\n                              (counts out his money)\n                         Ninety-four bucks.\n\n<b>                                     DEALER\n</b>                         Biggest pot of the whole game, I got \n                         to drop.\n\n<b>                                     DANNY\n</b>                              (to First Player)\n                         Interested?\n\n<b>                                     FIRST PLAYER\n</b>                         Wouldn't call you if I had a pair \n                         higher'n sixes.

The Kid's hand goes to \n               his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor \n               appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the \n               wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor \n               in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right \n               hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves \n               the razor blade against his neck.\n\n<b>                                     KID\n</b>                         Drop it.\n\n               As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the \n               door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough \n               momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, \n               dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles \n               his way out through a window.\n\n<b>               SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES\n</b>\n               Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door \n               just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to \n               get out of the building and after The Kid.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The \n               Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and \n               they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track \n               on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the \n               station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting \n               beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst \n               of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger \n               train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the \n               train into the depot.\n\n<b>               INT. UNION STATION, ST.

CROSSROADS COMMUNITY - DAY\n</b>\n               The bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings \n               around an intersection. The Kid is the only passenger to get \n               off here. As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an \n               attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question. \n               Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, \n               he crosses and goes into it. The STOREKEEPER comes back \n               outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to \n               go. It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the \n               store. The Kid starts up the road.\n\n<b>               (TIME LAPSE)\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. CREST OF ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n               The Kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the \n               crossroads, and looks down into the valley between this hill \n               and the next one. He starts down an even narrower road leading \n               to a little farm on a hillock in the valley. It consists of \n               a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a \n               few cultivated fields.\n\n<b>               (TIME LAPSE)\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

A little dog YAPS and runs from the front \n               door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that \n               direction and CAMERA MOVES to include The Kid as he unlatches \n               the gate and walks toward her.
