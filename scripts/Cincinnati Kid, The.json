Even more important to establish than \n               the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters \n               would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes \n               as \"Burst the Roosevelt Bubble,\" \"Save the American Way of \n               Life,\" \"Vote for Landon and Knox.\"\n\n               EXT. FACTORY - DAY\n\n               One of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket \n               line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is \n               anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct \n               conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance \n               open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a \n               small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this \n               that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets \n               or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction \n               pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               A couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault \n               them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, \n               dirty and noisy.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD\n\n               The eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are \n               clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the \n               SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening \n               on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER \n               of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                         Somebody shut the goddam window. Let \n                         a man think.\n\n               The player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also \n               owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. \n               Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table \n               look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, \n               extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself \n               the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid \n               have almost all the money on the table between them, about a \n               hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more \n               than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, \n               there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are \n               left in the hand.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                         Possible straight gets a --\n                              (deals the card)\n                         -- lovely little four.\n\n                                     FIRST PLAYER\n                         On the last hand even, you couldn't \n                         give me a break.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                         I put the brakes on your straight, \n                         didn't I?\n                              (he laughs; no one \n                              else does; he deals \n                              to The Kid)\n                         There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce.\n\n                                     KID\n                         Thanks.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                              (deals to Danny)\n                         And our lucky friend from Chicago \n                         gets a queen with his pair of sixes. \n                         Little lady make you happy, Buster?\n\n                                     DANNY\n                         Deal to yourself, clown.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                         Dealer gives himself a --\n                              (deals card and groans)\n                         I might have known.\n                              (to Danny)\n                         Bet your sixes, Buster.\n\n                                     DANNY\n                         I told you not to call me that.\n                              (then as the dealer \n                              turns away)\n                         Cost you --\n                              (counts out his money)\n                         Ninety-four bucks.\n\n                                     DEALER\n                         Biggest pot of the whole game, I got \n                         to drop.\n\n                                     DANNY\n                              (to First Player)\n                         Interested?\n\n                                     FIRST PLAYER\n                         Wouldn't call you if I had a pair \n                         higher'n sixes.

MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR\n\n               He is waiting when the door opens abruptly, and Danny appears, \n               his right hand in his coat pocket. The Kid's hand goes to \n               his own pocket and as he whirls around, a straight razor \n               appears in it, its blade snapped open. Pushing Danny to the \n               wall with one hand, he keeps him pinned there with the razor \n               in the other, while he bolts the door. Danny gets his right \n               hand out of the pocket with a gun in it, but The Kid moves \n               the razor blade against his neck.\n\n                                     KID\n                         Drop it.\n\n               As the gun clatters to the floor, and the others force the \n               door, The Kid takes a step backward to provide enough \n               momentum, then swings at Danny's middle with his left, \n               dropping him, then jumps up on the wash basin and wriggles \n               his way out through a window.\n\n               SUPERIMPOSE: MAIN TITLES\n\n               Danny recovers his balance and his gun, unbolts the door \n               just before it is smashed in, and runs with the others to \n               get out of the building and after The Kid.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY BACK OF RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n               The conflicting parties from the picket lines have moved on. \n               The Kid drops from the window to the ground and starts to \n               run toward the railroad yards. A few moments later, Danny \n               and four other poker players appear and run after him.\n\n               EXT. RAILROAD YARDS - DAY\n\n               The chase across the tracks goes on behind the Credits. The \n               Kid's pursuers split into two groups to cut him off, and \n               they seem to have succeeded in cornering him against a track \n               on which a passenger train is bearing down, headed for the \n               station. His dubious chance of escape depends on his getting \n               beyond this track in front of the train, which, with a burst \n               of speed, he manages to accomplish just in time. The passenger \n               train divides The Kid from his pursuers, and we PAN with the \n               train into the depot.\n\n               INT. UNION STATION, ST. LOUIS\n\n               The train slowly stops. Amid all the atmosphere of arrival \n               in a day when the Pullman car was still the ultimate in \n               travel, LANCEY HODGES appears on a platform, takes his bag \n               from the Pullman porter and passes it on to a Red Cap before \n               he has descended the steps. He walks with other passengers \n               and Red Caps toward the center of the station.\n\n               EXT.

BATHROOM\n\n               Christian, humming softly, turns off the water, takes a large \n               towel from a rack and puts it on a stool by the tub where it \n               will be more convenient for him. She lingers to test the \n               water with her finger and do anything else she can think of \n               to assure maximum comfort for her man. Then she steps back \n               into the bedroom. The sight of him makes her advance \n               cautiously and confirm her suspicion that he is asleep.\n\n               INT.

But the radio is across the room and it's \n               slightly easier for her to get out of the side of the bed \n               she's on, and go to the door of The Shooter's room. She opens \n               this and we see The Shooter in bed in his own small quarters, \n               reading a magazine.

She seems to regard the request as an imposition but \n               she does go grudgingly to the radio and turns it down a little \n               before she returns to her bed and her cosmetic chore.\n\n                                     SHOOTER\n                              (into phone)\n                         Hello?...

Everything \n               about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played \n               in.

The youngest, a good-\n               looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as \n               nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four \n               remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end \n               up with four cards of one suit showing.\n\n                                     SHOOTER\n                              (as he deals)\n                         Still queens -- possible flush -- no \n                         help -- possible flush.\n\n                                     FIRST WEALTHY TYPE\n                         Queens check to the possibles.\n\n                                     LANCEY\n                         Check.\n\n                                     SECOND WEALTHY TYPE\n                         Check.\n\n               Bill silently tosses in two of the rarest and highest ranking \n               chips on the table.\n\n                                     FIRST WEALTHY TYPE\n                         Fold.\n\n                                     LANCEY\n                         And up two.\n\n                                     SECOND WEALTHY TYPE\n                         Fold.\n\n                                     THIRD WEALTHY TYPE\n                         Biggest pot yet.\n\n               A phone RINGS and the Third Wealthy Type answers it.\n\n                                     BILL\n                         Call the two thou.\n\n                                     LANCEY\n                              (turning over queen \n                              of his suit)\n                         Queen high.\n\n                                     BILL\n                              (indignantly)\n                         Jack high.

CAMERA PANS ahead of them to \n               a group consisting of Hoban; HOBAN'S WOMAN, still sexy in \n               her forties; PIG, whose name could derive with equal \n               justification from either his looks or his manners; and SOKAL, \n               who talks colloquial American with a Central European accent. \n               The group as a whole is notable because its members have not \n               risen to their feet with everyone else, because all the men \n               are basking in the sun with their shirts off, because they \n               view the action on the field with detachment, and because, \n               nevertheless, they are constantly placing bets on details of \n               the game. Now, as people around them resume their seats, \n               Sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught.\n\n                                     SOKAL\n                              (to Hoban)\n                         You owe me two fish on the out, plus \n                         three on the inning, minus two on no \n                         strikeouts so far.\n\n               The Kid and Melba join them.\n\n                                     HOBAN\n                         Hiya, Kid.

When he sees a \n               door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight \n               as the latter comes toward him. It isn't until The Shooter \n               rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the \n               elevator that Felix makes his presence known.\n\n                                     FELIX\n                         Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr. \n                         Schlaegel asked me to remind you how \n                         eager he was to see you.\n\n               The doors of the elevator open. Felix yields precedence to \n               The Shooter and they enter it. The doors close.\n\n               INT. LOBBY, PLUSH HOTEL - AT THE ELEVATORS\n\n               An elevator opens, and The Shooter and Felix come out.\n\n                                     SHOOTER\n                         I ought to call my woman.\n\n                                     FELIX\n                         Yes, of course.

The Kid \n               pantomimes the question \"What for?\" but she just wiggles her \n               finger impatiently at the fastener while speaking into the \n               phone.\n\n                                     MELBA\n                              (into phone)\n                         Whose idea was that?\n\n               The Kid still doesn't know what she has in mind but it seems \n               easier to humor her than not. He unfastens the hook. Melba \n               smiles her thanks and, to his consternation, reaches back \n               and pulls the zipper all the way down. She places her hand \n               over the mouth-piece of the phone.\n\n                                     MELBA\n                              (to Kid)\n                         He's not coming home now.\n\n               She steps out of the dress.\n\n                                     MELBA\n                              (into phone)\n                         Whatever you say, Shooter man.\n\n               INT.

The Kid has a cup \n               of coffee by him, presumably with brandy in it; Lancey has \n               his frappe; Pig is drinking whiskey; the Shooter and Yeller \n               have bottles of bear. It is the end of a hand.

He gives himself a quick \n               once-over with it, the secures it around his waist, steps \n               out of the shower stall, and begins the process of shaving. \n               Melba meanwhile finishes restoring her makeup.\n\n                                     MELBA\n                         You any idea how much The Shooter \n                         has involved in this game of yours?\n\n                                     THE KID\n                         If Schlaegel bet as much on me as I \n                         heard, I guess he'd pay a nice piece \n                         of change to be sure I won.\n\n                                     MELBA\n                         It's worse than that.

Melba is so taken aback \n               she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. \n               The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his \n               tracks.

It was nothing.\n\n               She walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of \n               the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the \n               bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his \n               undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using \n               the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and \n               puts on his shorts and trousers.\n\n                                     THE KID\n                         You been to the place?\n\n                                     CHRISTIAN\n                         No, I've got my bag downstairs.

How's the game going?\n\n               The Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to \n               give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off \n               the soap.\n\n                                     THE KID\n                         It's come to be just me and Lancey.\n\n               He comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his \n               movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes \n               he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting \n               his shirt on.\n\n                                     CHRISTIAN\n                              (after the kiss)\n                         I was wondering.\n\n                                     THE KID\n                         I got my mind on the cards.\n\n                                     CHRISTIAN\n                         I know.
