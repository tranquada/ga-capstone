SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN\nCLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW\nMacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin\nHoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after\nher but UNSEEN.\nShe glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,\nher BREATHING becoming more labored.\nCutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.\nAbove her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten\nthe leaves.\nAround the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with\nbeautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her\nracing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.\n\nDREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR\nand safety loom half a block down. She pours on the\neffort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the\ndoor, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.\n\nANGLE ON THE SHRUB\nwhere, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN\nRETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT\nHEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!\n\nINT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION\nDrew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER\nfrom her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window\nin the front door and sees...\n\nDREW'S POV\nThe puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to\nextricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs\nit close:\n                           SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL\n             Where are you going, Jelly Bean?\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n                                                      2.\n\nINT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING\nCLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)\nwhich suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW\nWAGGING.\nFrom under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,\n17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the\nshrieking ALARM CLOCK.\nWith a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the\nbed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20\nT-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.\nGood enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit\nconcerned down at her navel.\nA recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She\ntouches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins\ntossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the\nsource.\nShe pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:\nTHOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.\nParker snickers, types her return from...\nNOTATWIN:   CONFESS\nTHOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.\nNOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.\nTHOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE\nCOURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.\nThis makes her smile.\nNOTATWIN:   A CAREER MAN.

In\na tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...\n... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little\nlabeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath\nwhere it says, \"tweezers.\"\nShe leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray\neyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her\nother eyebrow.

This is like when your mom cuts your hair and\nkeeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She\nreaches for the other side... but suddenly catches\nherself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too\npsychotic.\nShe dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces\nthem.\nChecking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her\nWATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.\n                           PARKER (O.S.)\n             Morning.\nStartled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water\npick.

When Parker sets her\nBlackberry down we get our first glimpse of...\n... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-\napocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear\nline of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized\nzone separating the    Koreas.\nParker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but\nnotices another message on her Blackberry:\nTHOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?\nNOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?\nTHOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.\nNOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.

She looks to her sister's side of\nthe counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered\nholder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...\nnah.\nInstead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,\nbrushes with a finger and spits.\n\nINT.
