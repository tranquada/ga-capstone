Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier,\nthe ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline.\n\nAn OLD MAN stares at the empty beach. Sun-worshipers hours away from\nbesmirching the dunes. His features are simple. He wears an old overcoat.\nHis face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more sunrises\nthan one would suspect. He inhales the crisp, salty air and lets a small,\nsatisfied smile cross his face.\n\nBehind him. a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the\nboardwalk. Three young boys skate around by on roller blades, passing a\nstreet hockey ball between them proficiently. The Old Man views them\nbriefly. checks his watch, and looks back toward the ocean.\n\nThe skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt. We pan up to\ntheir faces - now cold and dispassionate. They look at one another and nod.\n\nTheir skates glide out of frame.\n\nP.O.V. SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach.\nWe get closer and closer to him until...\n\nOne of the skaters checks him hard into the railing. The Old Man exhales\nviolently and falls to his knees. The two other skaters begin savagely\nbeating on him with their hockey sticks, as he crumbles beneath them.\nRepeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head.\n\n<b>OC VOICE\n</b>\nI don't understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on the\nwritings Lewis Caroll?\n\nThe three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Man's pulse.\nSatisfied, they skate away, leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk.\n\n<b>INT AIRPORT - DAY\n</b>\nLOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal. They pass through the\nmetal detectors. The Nun carries a donation can.\n\n<b>LOKI\n</b>\nLeaving 'Alice in Wonderland' aside, look closely at 'Through the Looking\nGlass' - particularly 'The Walrus and the Carpenter' poem: what's the\nmetaphorical meaning?\n\n<b>NUN\n</b>\nI wasn't aware there was one.\n\n<b>                                   LOKI\n</b>\nOh, but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized\nreligion. The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously refers to\neither the Buddha, or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant god,\nLord Ganesha. This takes care of the Eastern religions. The Carpenter is an\nobvious reference to Jesus Christ, who was purportedly raised the son of a\ncarpenter. He represents the Western religions. And in the poem. what do\nthey do? They dupe all the oysters into followmg them. Then. when the\noysters collective guard is down. the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck and\ndevour the helpless creatures, en masse. I don't know what that says to\nyou, but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological\nfigures insures the destruction of one's inner-being.\n\nBARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates. He eats\npopcorn and stares at...\n\nA steady stream of TRAVELERS, exiting the gate, meeting lovedones, family.\n\n<b>                                  OC LOKI\n</b>\nOrganized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our\nactions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who shakes\na finger at us from thousands of years ago and says \"No, no!\"\n\nBartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets, warmed. Loki saddles up beside him,\nkneeling on one of the seats, facing the Nun.\n\n<b>                                   LOKI\n</b>\n'Through the Looking Glass' - a children's tale?

You take that money you've\nbeen collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice\npiece of ass. You deserve it.\n\nThe Nun nods at him, and saunters off, obviously grappling with something.\nA passerby tries to stick money in her can, but she yanks it away. Loki\nfaces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the\nstill-transfixed Bartleby.\n\n<b>                                 BARTLEBY\n</b>\n                               (looking OC)\n\nHere's what I don't get about you: you know for a fact that there is a God.\nYou've been in his presence, he's talked to you personally.

No\nleaps of faith whatsoever. Alright -vou want the whole secret origin? Here\ngoes: Back in the old days, God was vengeful and hot-tempered, and his\nwrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki. When Sodom and\nGommorah were destroyed? That was Loki. When the waters wiped out\neverything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie? That was Loki. And\nhe was good at what he did. But one day, he refused to bear God's wrath any\nlonger.\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nWhy?\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nBecause he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby.\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nGrigori?\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nOne of the choirs of angels. They're called Watchers. Guess what they do?\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nSo they're like Guardian angels?\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nExactly like that, but different. So one day, Loki's wiping out all the\nfirst born of Egypt...\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nThe Tenth Plague.\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nSee? Tell a person you're the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy;\nmention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and they're suddenly\ntheology scholars. May I continue uninterrupted?\n\n(Bethany nods)\n\nSo once he's done with the first born, Loki takes his friend Bartleby out\nfor a post-slaughter drink. And over many rounds, they get into this\ndiscussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay. Now,\nBartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually, not to mention the\nfact that Loki's more than half in the bag, and in the end, Bartleby\nconvinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that\ndoesn't involve slaughter. So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he quits:\nthrows down his fiery sword, gives him the finger - which ruins it for the\nrest of us. because from that day forward, God decreed that angels could no\nlonger imbibe alcohol. Hence all the spitting.\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nSounds reasonable.\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nMaybe to you, but I'm a lush by nature.\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nI mean about the angel of Death's resignation.\n\n<b>                                 METATRON\n</b>\nFor a liberal, yes, but this is the Angel of Death we're talking about.

Another skater whips in and slashes at her, but\nshe ducks. The stick hits the car door above her. She rifles through her\npurse madly until another skater whips by, dragging her purse away with his\nstick. Bethany looks up.\n\nThe Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly, a few feet from her.

Between the time when He established\nthe faith and the church started to officially organize, the powers-that-be\ndecided that while the message of Christ was integral, the fact that He was\nblack was a detriment. So all renderings were ordered to be Eurocentric,\neven though the brother was blacker than Jesse.\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nIf that's true, then why'd He get written about while you were left out?\n\n<b>                                   RUFUS\n</b>\nWell He is the Son of God, right?

Another way is to say I was bludgeoned to\nshit by big rocks. See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the world\nand spread His word. Antioch was already garnering a big Christian\nfollowing, so I got sent there. And was a big hit. They loved hearing about\nJesus' message, and how He was the Redeemer. But when I mentioned He was\nblack, the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit.

White folks only want to hear the good\nshit: life eternal, a place in God's kingdom. As soon as they hear they're\ngetting all this from a black Jesus, they freak. And that - my friends - is\ncalled Hypocrisy. Folks just can't accept a black Savior.\n\n(to Silent Bob)\n\nYou going to eat that hash brown?\n\n<b>                                  BETHANY\n</b>\nSo you went to Heaven?\n\n<b>                                   RUFUS\n</b>\nShit yeah; it was the least the brother could do. I gave up my sheep and\nfollowed His ass around Jerusalem for three years. And in all that time,\ndid I ever get laid? Hell no! But I didn't bitch, because I was into His\nmessage. And while the message is what counts, folks should know that He\nwas black.

The crowd is rather thin.\n\nJay and Silent Bob sit at the stage. their eyes glued on...\n\nThe DANCER - a gorgeous, shapely vixen with very little clothing on, and\ngrowing littler by the second.\n\nJay pokes Silent Bob, who produces a wad of bills. They skim off a nice\npile and stow the rest. They spread their piles neatly on the bar. The\nDancer smiles and starts dancing toward them. Jay holds up a five-spot and\nperforms his own little seductive dance ~th it. He stands at the edge of\nthe stage, ~'rating. The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in her\nG-string.

The other three members of his\nposse smile and slap hands.\n\nThe Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction, heading toward\nthe Gang. Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob.\n\nThe Gang Leader leans forward, preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously\nloud throat~learing.\n\nJay holds aloft a twenty, smiling and nodding.\n\nThe Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction. The Gang\nLeader looks at his posse, who shake their heads at him, disappointedly.\n\nThe Stage becomes a bidding table, as - on one side - the Gang Leader\nproduces two twenties.

I've seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal all\nthe details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are to\nsuccess. Suffice it to say, the Catholics have been even more helpful in\ninsuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav.\n\n(gets up)\n\nThe only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion. I'm amazed that\nsomeone up there would have the balls to make a move without the Lord's\nsay-so. Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that\ntrain.

But true to his irresponsible\nnature. man won t own up to being the engineer of evil, so he blames his\ndark deeds on my ilk. But his selfishness is limitless, and it's not enough\nfor him to shadow his own existence. He turned Hell into a suffering Pitt -\nfire, wailing, darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything to get\nout of. And why? Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself. It is\nbeyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you\ncommit. No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a\nfoundless belief that God could never forgive your 'grievous offenses'. So\nyou bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the horrid\nimaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the sickness\nthat has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there,\nbegging to be 'punished'. And in doing so, they've transformed the cold and\nsolitude to pain and misery. I've spent eons privy to the flames, inhaling\nthe decay, hearing the wail of the damned. I know what effect such horrors\nhave on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg.\n\n(beat)\n\nWould you like to glimpse pain eternal? Look...\n\nAzrael places his hand over Bethany's eyes.
