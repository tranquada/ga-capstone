She blinks.\n\n    CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside\n    her mouth.\n\n    CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together.\n\n    CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES\n<b>    ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS.\n</b>\n    FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress\n    with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to\n    a wooden table.\n\n<b>    AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.

All that's visible are his hands.    His\n    left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right\n    appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together\n    again...

HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE\n    IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and\n    BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up.\n\n    The light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop.\n\n    The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER\n    RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound.\n\n    No time to waste.

She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a\n     rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as...\n\n     LIGHTS FLICKER.

The SCREAMS drown out any\n     sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP...\n\n     The lights return to NORMAL.       The Young Man STOPS screaming.\n     The place goes silent.\n\n     The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...       A LOUD CREAK\n     RINGS OUT.

Cruelly most times. But the\n                righteous persevere. They do what\n                needs to be done, even though they\n                don't want to. It's what makes a man,\n                a man. Let me tell you the story of\n                Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles.\n                Judas led Roman Soldiers to the\n                capture and eventual death of our Lord\n                Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly\n                seated next to Satan, his soul burning\n                in hell forever for this sin. But I\n                don't believe that's the case. I have\n                my own theory. The death of Jesus was\n                predicted thousands of years before\n                Judas ever came along. And for the\n                prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to\n                die. If he didn't, the gates of\n                heaven couldn't be opened for mankind.\n                I don't think, for an instant, Judas\n                wanted to be the one, but... someone\n                had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus\n                could die for our sins. Save us all.\n                And I believe at this moment... Judas\n                is in heaven, despite his sin, because\n                it led to the greater good.\n                    (Beat)\n                Relations prior to marriage is a sin.\n                You and Sheryl are sinners in the\n                Lord's eyes. And because of those\n                sins, your souls are damned. But Ida\n                and Me, we're gonna give you a chance\n                to save your souls and do the right\n                thing, but... as previously stated,\n                you will need to persevere and show\n                the strength and will of your\n                character.
