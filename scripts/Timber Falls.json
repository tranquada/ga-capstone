TORTURE ROOM #1                                         1\n\n    CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her\n    eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks.\n\n    CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside\n    her mouth.\n\n    CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together.\n\n    CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES\n    ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS.\n\n    FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress\n    with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to\n    a wooden table.\n\n    AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.    OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD-\n    CURDLING SCREAM cries out.\n\n    The Young Woman's breathing intensifies.   She watches the\n    light bulb, listens to the screams.\n\n    The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.    Peace\n    for a moment. But she knows that won't last.\n\n2   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         2\n\n    A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles\n    secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess.\n\n    CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH,\n    sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by...\n\n    A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.    His\n    left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right\n    appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together\n    again... SPARKS FLY.\n\n                         YOUNG MAN\n               Please-please stop. D-don't.\n\n    The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left\n    cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side.\n\n    ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS\n    BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE.\n\n3   INT. TORTURE ROOM #1                                           3\n\n    CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.   The screams of the Young\n    Man echo through the room.\n\n                                                                2.\n\n\n    The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS\n    then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and...\n\n    Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in\n    unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE\n    IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and\n    BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up.\n\n    The light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop.\n\n    The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER\n    RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound.\n\n    No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her\n    left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves.\n\n4   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                            4\n\n    CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and...\n    ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS.\n\n5   INT.   CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1                                    5\n\n    The Young Woman's left hand POPS free.    Blood oozes out.\n\n    OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN.\n\n    She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain.\n    Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs,\n    tries to muffle the noise best she can.\n\n    The SCREAMS STOP.   Lights return to normal.\n\n    Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties\n    them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties\n    them around her palm's wounds.\n\n6   INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2                                   6\n\n    The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is\n    clear. It is.\n\n    We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel,\n    really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front\n    of her another to her right. The door across from her is\n    slightly ajar...\n\n    YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the\n    chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the\n    door and the Young Man.\n\n    The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure\n    has his back to her.\n\n                                                                3.\n\n\n     THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young\n     Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself.\n\n     The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words \"I Love\n     you\". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a\n     rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as...\n\n     LIGHTS FLICKER.     OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again.\n\n     The Young Woman quickens her pace. The SCREAMS drown out any\n     sound, until... just before she touches THE TOP STEP...\n\n     The lights return to NORMAL.       The Young Man STOPS screaming.\n     The place goes silent.\n\n     The Young Woman's foot TOUCHES THE STEP...       A LOUD CREAK\n     RINGS OUT. The Young Woman FREEZES.\n\n7    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    7\n\n     The Concealed Figure TURNS towards the sound.\n\n8    HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                    8\n\n     The Young Woman holds her breath.       Did he hear her?\n\n9    TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                    9\n\n     A STEEL AXE/SICKLE hybrid (a scary, handmade invention),\n     rusted, save for the razor sharp edge, sticks in a nearby\n     wooden horse. The Concealed Figure SNATCHES the weapon.\n\n                            YOUNG MAN\n                SARAH!    RUN!\n\n10   HALLWAY, STAIRS--                                                10\n\n     Sarah (Young Woman) bolts up the remaining steps.\n\n11   TORTURE ROOM #2--                                                11\n\n     The Concealed Figure rushes for the door.      In pursuit.\n\n                                                          SMASH CUT TO:\n\n12   EXT.   FOREST - SUNSET                                           12\n\n     SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet\n     and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs,\n     anything in her way. Not too far behind...\n\n     THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden)\n     follows her. WEAPON IN HAND.\n\n                                                                 4.\n\n\n     SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips,\n     falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A\n     LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears...\n\n     THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance.\n\n     SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away.\n\n13   EXT.   FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET                       13\n\n     Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE\n     STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side...\n\n     SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom,\n     200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby.\n\n     Before Sarah can fully digest the situation...\n\n     THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in\n     his hand. Anticipating its use.\n\n     Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier.\n     Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do?\n\n     The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH\n     JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other.\n\n     The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over...\n\n     AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody\n     among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD\n     mixes with the water turning it a deep RED.\n\n     CUE TITLE: TIMBER FALLS...\n\n                                                          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n14   EXT.   HIGHWAY - WEST VIRGINIA - DAY (HELICOPTER 2ND UNIT)    14\n\n     A black four-door VW Passat cruises the interstate.     A Gortex\n     duffel is strapped to the roof.\n\n15   I/E.   PASSAT (MOVING) - DAY                                  15\n\n     MIKE WARREN, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to\n     kill, sits at the wheel. Even a flashy pair of sunglasses\n     can't mask the twinkle in his eye.\n\n     SHERYL JAMES, late 20s, rides shotgun. This beauty's got it\n     all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile.\n\n     An opened bag of chips sit in her lap. A couple of Diet\n     Cokes in the cup-holders. She cradles a cellphone MP3\n     player.\n\n                                                   5.\n\n\n                    MIKE\n          Come on, hit me.\n\n                    SHERYL\n              (Flipping through tunes)\n          Chill...I gotta find -- alright.\n\n                    MIKE\n          You got one?\n\nSheryl hits the \"Play\" button.\n\n                    MIKE\n          \"Warning Shots\", Thievery Corporation.\n\nMike grins.   Sheryl rolls her eyes.\n\n                     MIKE\n          Come on.   Next one.\n\nSheryl scrolls again, hits play.\n\n                    MIKE\n          \"Bullets\" by the Editors.\n\nSheryl frowns.   Mike grins and shoots her a wink.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          You loaded these songs. You don't\n          need to be so impressed with yourself.\n\n                    MIKE\n          I know I don't have to be.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          I haven't even heard of half these\n          bands.\n\n                    MIKE\n          It's called good music. You should\n          try to familiarize yourself with it,\n          instead of listening to the crap you\n          do.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          I listen to crap?\n\n                    MIKE\n          Hurts me to be the one to tell you.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          I'm sure it does.\n\n                                                        6.\n\n\n                      MIKE\n           You gotta be more like me, baby.\n           Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm\n           looking for the next Beatles, U2 or\n           Radiohead.\n\nSheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles.\n\n                     SHERYL\n           So, where does this band fall into\n           that group?\n\nThe music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, \"I WANT TO BE A COWBOY\"\nblares.\n\n                     SHERYL\n           Fresh, new or cutting edge?\n\nMike immediately begins to backtrack.\n\n                     MIKE\n           How'd that get on there?\n\n                     SHERYL\n           You loaded the songs.   You tell me?\n\n                     MIKE\n           Must be a mistake.\n\n                     SHERYL\n           Says here you've listened to it 86\n           times.\n\nBusted.\n\n                     SHERYL\n           Is this true? Have you always wanted\n           to be a cowboy?\n\nSheryl spies more...\n\n                     SHERYL\n           You also got \"Men Without Hats\"\n           greatest hits? I didn't know they\n           qualified for a greatest hits album.\n           Can you break me off a little \"Safety\n           Dance\"?\n\nMike reaches for the MP3 player.\n\n                     MIKE\n           Okay, give me that.\n\nThe Passat speeds past a \"West Virginia\" state sign.\n\n              SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          7.\n\n\n16   EXT.   NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - DAY                           16\n\n     The sun BURNS above.   The Passat turns into the park.\n\n17   EXT.   PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY                      17\n\n     The Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. Next to the lot is\n     the Ranger Station.\n\n18   INT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                              18\n\n     Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some\n     of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant\n     bear, fill in the gaps.\n\n     Mike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads\n     toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor.\n\n     SAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a\n     hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He\n     continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike\n     wait. And wait. Then...\n\n                          MIKE\n                Good morning.\n\n     Sam holds up a \"wait a second\" finger.     After a beat...\n\n                          SAM\n                Now what can I do you two for?\n\n     Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking\n     gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc.\n\n                          MIKE\n                Well...ah...\n\n                          SAM\n                First time here and you're not quite\n                sure where to begin.\n\n     Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier.\n\n     ANGLE ON - There are pictures, an Emergency Contact\n     Information, Guided Tour Info, etc.\n\n                          SAM\n                Something like that.\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Precisely like that.\n\n     Sam stands, grabs his lower back, a recurring discomfort.     As\n     he digs around for something...\n\n        SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          8.\n\n\nSheryl notices, on the board...\n\nANGLE ON - A flier for a young missing couple.     Below that...\n\nANGLE ON - A photo of a girl: \"Sarah Travers\"(from the\nopening scene).\n\nSheryl studies it and shakes off any concern by locking arms\nwith Mike at the desk.\n\n                    SAM\n          Get you started with one of these.\n\nSam grabs a map and lays it out in front of the couple.\n\n                    SAM\n          How long you folks hiking for?\n\n                      MIKE\n          Two days.    Heading out early Sunday.\n\n                    SAM\n          Well, if you move at a decent clip,\n          you could hit the summit by midday\n          tomorrow. Should still give you time\n          to take it all in and make it down.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          Any particular path?\n\n                    SAM\n          You folks experienced hikers?\n\n                    MIKE\n          We've done some ah--\n\n                    SHERYL\n              (interrupting)\n          No. Nothing like this.\n\n                    SAM\n          For first-timers, I recommend either\n          Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.\n\n                    SHERYL\n          Donner Trail?

You see one, you head the other\n          way, especially if he's feeding.

He moves quickly up the path, a\n     steep incline. He brushes past a bush and stops. Lying just\n     off the path... SHERYL'S BLUE HIKER'S TOWEL. He picks it up.\n\n                              MIKE\n                 Sheryl?!\n\n     No reply.   His heart now POUNDING.\n\n     Mike moving faster.

Sheryl's backpack lies against\n     a tree. A few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts.\n     Next to them... her shirt. But no Sheryl, until...\n\n                           SHERYL (OS)\n                 Good old Hansel. Following the trail\n                 of bread crumbs.\n\n     Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock, wearing just\n     her bra and panties. She smiles at him coyly. Mike exhales\n     deeply. Relieved, but fuming.\n\n                              MIKE\n                 You bitch.\n\n       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          21.\n\n\n                    SHERYL\n          Doesn't feel good to be teased, does\n          it?\n\nOkay, he had that coming.\n\n                     MIKE\n          Truce?\n\n                     SHERYL\n          Truce.\n\nHe takes her in.

Mike breaks the embrace.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Don't disappear on me again.\n\nSheryl mouths the words, \"I promise.\"    Crosses her heart.\n\nHe leans in, they kiss again.   Soft and sweet at first.   Then\nit deepens.\n\nSheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss\nagain. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another.\n\nMike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her\nlegs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about\nto remove it, when:\n\n                    DARRYL (O.S.)\n          Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out.\n\nDARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE,\n20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by...\n\nBRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody\nclutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the\nother.\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Looks like we got ourselves a little\n          party.\n\nBrody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike,\nwho shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra\nback closed.\n\n                    MIKE\n          We were just moving our way up the\n          mountain.\n\n                                                          22.\n\n\n                    LONNIE\n          You were moving your way'round more\n          than just that.\n\nSheryl eyes her discarded clothes.   Darryl spots them too.\nHe grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them.\n\n                    DARRYL\n              (Referring to the smell)\n          Like a peach.\n\nMike tries to seem relaxed and friendly.\n\n                    BRODY\n          You folks best be careful about what\n          you do up here...

Up from\n          Charleston roughing it, seeing how the\n          \"other\" half lives?\n\n                    MIKE\n          No, we're from Virginia, just up for a\n          weekend trip. And, uh... you folks\n          live up here?\n\nBrody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike.\n\n                    BRODY\n          It's easy to spot the city folk. It's\n          like they're trying to be friendly,\n          when really they don't want to be.\n\n                    MIKE\n          I think you just startled us is all.\n\nSheryl looks over at...\n\n...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly\nflails it about.\n\nUncomfortable silence.\n\n                                                       23.\n\n\n                       MIKE\n             We'll just be on our way.\n                 (Re: Sheryl's shorts)\n             May I have those?\n\nA bold move from Mike.\n\n                       DARRYL\n             Finders keepers.\n\nLong beat.    Tension high.\n\n                       BRODY\n             Darryl.\n\nBrody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back.\n\nDarryl reluctantly obliges.\n\nMike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and\nLonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does.\n\nMike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody\nstops them with the barrel of his shotgun.\n\n                       BRODY\n             Where you runnin' off to?\n\n                       LONNIE\n             Yeah, we just getting acquainted and\n             shit.\n\nMike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest.\nHe can no longer hide his fear.\n\n                       MIKE\n             We just want to get a little further\n             along before the sun sets.\n\nDarryl eyes the sky.    The sun beams down through the trees.\n\n                       DARRYL\n             Plenty of time'fore that.\n\n                       MIKE\n             Look. We don't want any trouble.

Brody smiles a yellow smile.\n\n       SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006     24.\n\n\n                    BRODY\n          You folks enjoy the spirits?\n\n                       MIKE\n          Excuse me?

Mike eyes\nSheryl. Clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea.\n\nMike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip. He\nsquirms, winces, but forces it down. Mike turns red and\ncoughs. Brody and Darryl are loving it.\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that?\n\nDarryl would win that bet.\n\n                    BRODY\n          Fifty bucks.\n\nMike has no idea what he's talking about.\n\n                    BRODY\n          I'll sell you the jar for fifty bucks.\n\n                    DARRYL\n              (Ogles Sheryl)\n          Or maybe we could do us a little\n          trade.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Let me get my wallet.\n\nMike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around.\n\nANGLE ON - INSIDE THE BAG... the .38 Revolver.\n\n                                                       25.\n\n\nMike thinks about grabbing it.

There are a couple more falls in\n  the park, but none quite so...\n  inviting as this one. Now don't take\n  my word for it, you can see for\n  yourself... How long's your stay?\n\n            SHERYL\n  Just til Sunday.\n\n            CLYDE\n  Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on\n  the other side. It would take you a\n  couple nights just to get there.\n\n            SHERYL\n  Maybe next time.\n\n            MIKE\n  This is a quickie trip. Just getting\n  out of the city for a couple days.\n\n            CLYDE\n  The city, huh. Which? If it's\n  Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya.\n  Whole place smells like feet. I gotta\n  haul myself all the way down to the\n  hospital there for my yearly because\n  the darn HMO's rules and regulations\n  won't let me visit the local Doc. Not\n  my cup of tea at all, but if you like\n  it there, then...\n\n            SHERYL\n  No, we're not from Charleston.\n\n       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006             29.\n\n\n                     MIKE\n           But apparently we look like we are.\n\n                     SHERYL\n           We live in Alexandria.

Let's see... Oh, I\n           got it. \"Five Corners\" will be\n           perfect. It's just a bit up the ways\n           here, near the Lake. It's five large\n           rocks which sit in a clearing with a\n           view of the whole park. The rocks\n           retain the heat from the day, so if\n           you set up camp between them you won't\n           be so cold.\n\n                                                             30.\n\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Sounds perfect.\n\n                            MIKE\n                Thanks.\n\n                          CLYDE\n                Just doing my job.

As they step through\n     the woods, they look upon...\n\n     FIVE LARGE ROCKS, arranged in an awkward semi-circle.\n\n     They walk into the circle, take off their backpacks.\n\n                          SHERYL\n                This is incredible.\n\n     Mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts.\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Ranger said there's a lake near by.\n\n                            MIKE\n                What?\n\n                            SHERYL\n                The lake.

A sleeping bag wrapped\n     around them.\n\n                          MIKE\n                That was... the worst dinner ever.\n\n                           SHERYL\n                    (Beat)\n                You cooked.\n\n                                                               32.\n\n\n                           MIKE\n                Yeah, I'm aware.\n                    (Beat)\n                You know what would make this evening\n                perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole\n                jar of it.

Just as he gets\n     knee deep...\n\n     OFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT!\n\n     Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest.\n\n                            MIKE\n                Sheryl!\n\n     He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods.\n\n                                                               37.\n\n\n45   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY                                  45\n\n     Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the\n     steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction\n     and slips, BANGING his knee.\n\n                          MIKE\n                Fuck!\n                    (Top of his lungs)\n                Sheryl!\n\n     Mike pushes himself up, continues on.\n\n46   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY                               46\n\n     Mike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch\n     of trees and hustles down a slope.\n\n47   EXT.   CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       47\n\n     Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing.        Looking\n     around wildly...\n\n     POV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the\n     same? Not even sure which direction he just came from.\n\n                           MIKE\n                Sheryl!\n\n     Still nothing.   Mike swallows.     What to do now?\n\n                                                            SMASH CUT TO:\n\n48   EXT.   WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  48\n\n     TIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees.     HIS LEGS\n     trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then...\n\n     Mike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal\n     BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out.\n\n     The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there.\n\n     Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes\n     about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE\n     SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE.\n\n     He removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it\n     around his wound.\n\n     Mike lays back, stares up into the sky.     Tries to catch his\n     breath, calm down. Then...\n\n     Faint sound of LAUGHTER.\n\n                                                            38.\n\n\n     Mike sits up.     Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER.\n\n     Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE\n     LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction.\n\n49   EXT.   WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  49\n\n     Mike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees.     He\n     stops at the top and looks down.\n\n     POV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the\n     trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about\n     something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles.\n\n     Mike's about fifteen feet above them.      He narrows his focus\n     in on...\n\n     MIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand.     It's\n     Sheryl's blue hikers' towel.\n\n     Mike turns red with fury.    He looks back down...\n\n     MIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder.\n\n     Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near\n     a tree, parallel to him.\n\n50   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY                             50\n\n     Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until...\n\n     OFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK.\n\n     Darryl stops, turns.    Lonnie looks at Daryl.\n\n                          LONNIE\n                What is it? Hear something?\n\n     Darryl holds his look into the woods, then...\n\n                            DARRYL\n                Nah.    It's nothing.\n\n     Suddenly, Mike LEAPS from behind a tree, WHACKS the surprised\n     Darryl across the face with the stick. Darryl drops like a\n     sack of potatoes.\n\n     Mike locks eyes with a terrified Lonnie.\n\n                          MIKE\n                Where is she!?\n\n     Lonnie pauses, frozen.    He then takes off, disappearing\n     through the trees.\n\n                                                    39.\n\n\nDarryl lies on the ground, MOANING. He pushes himself up to\nhis knees. BLOOD POURS from a fresh gash across his head.\n\nMike grabs Darryl's shotgun, aims at Darryl.\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Whoa... take it easy.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Where is she?\n\n                      DARRYL\n          Who?    What the fuck you talking about?\n\n                    MIKE\n          What did you do to her?\n\n                    DARRYL\n          I didn't fuckin' do nothing.\n\n                    MIKE\n          WHERE IS SHE?!\n\n                    DARRYL\n          I don't know!\n\nMike CRACKS Darryl across THE JAW with the barrel.\n\n                    MIKE\n          You have Sheryl's towel...What the\n          fuck did you do to her?!\n\nDarryl's a mess, his nose busted. He gags on blood and\nteeth. Mike stares at the bloody desight that is Darryl.\nEven Mike has to turn away for a moment for this. Then...\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Foun' towel.\n\n                      MIKE\n          What?\n\n                    DARRYL\n          I foun' the towel.\n\n                    MIKE\n          You found it? That's you're fucking\n          story, you inbred fuck?!\n              (Points gun at Darryl's head)\n          Stop fucking lying or I will kill you!\n\n                                                          40.\n\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Don' kill me...Please...I foun' it...\n          Up...Up the paf back `dere...just a\n          bit ago... fuckin'swear!\n\nMike's finger itches the trigger. He's turning red.\nBreathing hard, heavy. Then... Mike relents. Lowers the\nweapon, turns his back to Darryl, stares into the woods.\n\nThe tension fades for the moment.   But only a moment.\n\n                     DARRYL\n          Didn't think you had dat in you, city\n          boy.\n               (Looks at his shirt; the blood)\n          Shit... I just got dis shirt.\n\nDarryl, while Mike is distracted, seizes his opportunity,\nreaches behind...\n\nANGLE ON - Darryl slides a POCKET KNIFE from his back pocket.\n\n                    DARRYL\n          Damn shame you lost dat fine piece\n          o'ass. Something dat sweet don't\n          come'round every day. Even for pretty\n          folk like you.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Shut the fuck up.\n\nANGLE ON - Still concealed from Mike, Darryl opens the pocket\nknife, the BLADE fully extended.\n\n                    DARRYL\n          You best hope you find her'fore I do.\n          `cause I will enjoy tearing her ass\n          apart.\n              (Mike turns, faces Darryl)\n          And when I'm done there, I will cut\n          her eyeballs out and skull fuck her.\n              (Mike simmers to a boil)\n          Any luck, Brody's already beat me to\n          it.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Sonofabitch!\n\nMike takes a step towards Darryl, when... Darryl LUNGES OUT\nAT MIKE, POCKET KNIFE IN HAND.\n\nDarryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to\nknock Mike down, the shotgun falls to the side.\n\n                                                                 41.\n\n\n     Darryl pins Mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife\n     into him, but Mike grabs his wrist. They struggle. Darryl\n     PUSHES down, the knife INCHES CLOSER TO MIKE'S CHEST,\n     until...\n\n     Mike HEAD-BUTTS Darryl, sending the skinny Hick off him.\n     Darryl rolls away in pain.\n\n     Mike scrambles, crawls for... the shotgun.       He grabs it.\n\n     Darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with...\n\n     WHACK! MIKE bashes Darryl's face with the butt.        This knocks\n     Darryl completely out.\n\n     Mike stands over Darryl.     A beat.   Then...\n\n                           MIKE\n                SHERYL!\n\n51   EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                                 51\n\n     The morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce\n     the cloudy skies.\n\n52   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - DAY                                         52\n\n     Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow.      He\n     freezes, completely floored.\n\n     Everything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits,\n     everything. Even the fire pit.\n\n     Mike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless.\n\n     He SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells.       He closes\n     it, heads back into the woods.\n\n53   OMIT                                                              53\n\n54   EXT.   WOODS #3, TIMBER FALLS TRAILS - DAY                        54\n\n     Mike moves deeper into the woods.      He's a mix of paranoia and\n     determination.\n\n     Mike pauses, catching his breath, when... A FEW BLOOD DROPS\n     OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the\n     blood. What the fuck?\n\n     A couple more DROPS hit him.    Mike LOOKS UP...\n\n     A MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by\n     coarse thick ropes.\n\n                                                               42.\n\n\n     Mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware...       A FEW FEET\n     BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP.\n\n     Mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues\n     backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer...\n     his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP...\n\n     SNAP! CRUNCH!    MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN\n     ON HIS LEG!\n\n     Mike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his\n     leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel.\n\n                            MIKE\n                HELP!?!?!\n\n     Mike writhes in pain on the ground.    His eyes watering.     The\n     pain UNBEARABLE. Then...\n\n     MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the\n     forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND\n     The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden.\n\n     Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The\n     pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then...\n\n     Ida bends down next to Mike.\n\n                          IDA\n                Michael, can you hear me?    Michael...\n\n     Her words fade out.    He promptly PASSES OUT.\n\n                                                           CUT TO BLACK.\n\n     ON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS.\n\n     FADE IN:\n\n55   INT.   IDA'S CABIN - DAY                                       55\n\n     CLOSE ON - Mike's eyes SNAP open, dart side to side, blink.\n\n     REVEAL - Mike lays on a ragged couch.    The place is dark and\n     dusty. A glance around...\n\n     Gaslights hang in the corners. A stack of logs rest next to\n     an old fireplace. Just off the main room is a kitchen\n     alcove, with a coal stove. On the stove a WHISTLING TEAPOT.\n\n     Mike's memory slowly comes back.    He leans up when...\n\n                            MIKE\n                Ow!\n\n                                                       43.\n\n\nA sharp pain shoots through his body. Mike reaches for his\nleg. The tourniquet conceals the damage. A damn towel is\nwrapped around where the wound is. A bandage has replaced\nthe Gray Bandana on his arm.\n\nIda enters the cabin from the back door, into the kitchen.\nShe removes the teapot from the burner. The whistling stops.\n\n                    IDA\n          Look who's up.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Where am I?\n\n                    IDA\n          You're in my home, Michael. You gave\n          me quite a scare. I thought I lost\n          you.\n\nIda grabs a wet wash cloth, wrings it out over a basin and\nwalks back to Mike.\n\n                    IDA\n          Lucky the snap didn't break the bone,\n          just bruised it. I know that's of\n          little comfort now, but trust me, it's\n          a good thing. That dirty trap\n          however's prime for spreading\n          infection, need to finish cleaning out\n          that wound and then I'll get some\n          \"evening primrose\" in you. Same stuff\n          the Indian Tribes used it back in the\n          day to heal, well... just about\n          everything. So's do I.\n\nIda unwraps the tourniquet, examines the wound.\n\n                    IDA\n          Try and relax.\n\nIda cleans the wound.    Mike winces.   He can't watch.\n\n                       MIKE\n          Thank you.     For saving my life.\n\n                    IDA\n          You don't have to thank me. Up here,\n          we take care of one another. That's\n          the only way any of us survive.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Um...\n              (Thinks...)\n          I'm sorry, but I don't know your name.\n\n       SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006      44.\n\n\n                    IDA\n          Oh for the sake of sunshine... how\n          rude a host am I? Name's Ida Foster.\n\nIda moves to the kitchen, grabs a mason jar with clear\nliquid. It looks just like the jar Mike bought from Brody.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Ida, I need some help.\n\n                    IDA\n          I'm moving as fast as I can, sweetie.\n\n                    MIKE\n          No, not me. It's Sheryl. My\n          girlfriend. You met her with me\n          yesterday. Something's happened to\n          her. She was gone this morning when I\n          woke up. I looked everywhere and I\n          couldn't find her. We need to call\n          someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We\n          need to find her right away. Do you\n          have a phone?\n\n                     IDA\n          I'm sorry, but I don't. Never really\n          had use for one.\n              (Beat)\n          I do have a radio. We can call down\n          to base if you'd like.\n\nIda comes back to the couch.\n\n                    IDA\n          After we take care of you.\n\n                    MIKE\n          I'm fine, Ida, please... if you could\n          call now.\n\n                    IDA\n          You want to lose this leg? Cause\n          that's what you're risking. Soon as\n          we're done, I'll call. Okay?\n\nMike concedes.   Ida hands a second rag to Mike.\n\n                    IDA\n          Bite down on this... I ain't gonna\n          lie... Lotta pain about to hit you\n          sweetheart.\n\n                                                        45.\n\n\nMike puts the rag in his mouth. Ida dips the used cloth in\nthe moonshine. He closes his eyes TIGHT, and... Ida applies\nthe moonshine to the wound.\n\nMike SCREAMS through the cloth.\n\n                       IDA\n          It's okay.     It's almost over.\n\nIda repeats. Mike SCREAMS again. His eyes water.\n\nIda offers her palm.    Mike opens his mouth.   The cloth falls\ninto her hand.\n\nMike BREATHES HEAVILY, coming down from the pain.\n\nIda crosses to the kitchen, disposes of the two wash cloths\nand grabs a larger towel. She walks back to Mike and wraps\nhis calf with the towel.\n\n                    IDA\n          We'll get some of that primrose in you\n          and you'll be good as new.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Ida?

She\nopens and enters, sure to close the door behind her.\n\nMike relaxes, as best he can anyway.    Until...\n\nKNOCK, KNOCK.\n\n                    BRODY (OS)\n          Ida, you in there?!\n\nMIKE'S POV - Through a small slit in the drapes, Brody waits\noutside.\n\nIda exits the room, heads for the door.\n\n                    MIKE\n              (Whispers)\n          He's looking for me.\n\n                    IDA\n              (Whispers; concerned)\n          Why's that?\n\n                                                        46.\n\n\n                    BRODY (OS)\n          Ida!\n\n                    MIKE\n              (Whispers)\n          I think he had something to do with\n          Sheryl going missing.\n\nKNOCK, KNOCK.\n\n                    IDA\n              (Whispers)\n          I'll take care of it.\n\n                    BRODY (OS)\n          Ida, lemme in!\n\n                    IDA\n          I'm coming!\n\nIda helps Mike stand, re-directs him to the kitchen alcove.\nHe winces all the way. She leans him up against the near\nwall so that he is out of view of the door.\n\nIda goes to the front door, opens it halfway, revealing an\nagitated Brody, shotgun in hand.\n\nSuspicious, Brody tries to peek past Ida into the cabin.    She\ndoesn't budge.\n\n                    BRODY\n          What took you so long?\n\n                    IDA\n          What do you want, Brody?\n\n                    BRODY\n          I'm looking for a man hiker.\n\n                    IDA\n          This \"man hiker\" alone or wit someone?\n\n                    BRODY\n          He had a lady friend, but...    I'm just\n          looking for him now.\n\nON MIKE - Listening nervously.\n\n                    IDA\n          Well, I ain't seen no one in days.\n\nBrody glares at her. She glares right back. Brody again\ntries to see past her into the cabin, but she blocks him.\n\n                                                      47.\n\n\n                    IDA\n          What'd he do you for anyway?\n\n                     BRODY\n          He busted Darryl's face in with a\n          shotgun. Left him a mess of blood and\n          teeth. Nearly killed him.\n              (Beat)\n          You spot anyone you don't know, you be\n          sure to find me.\n\n                       IDA\n          Fine.\n\nBrody eyeballs Ida one last time, then leaves. Ida watches\nhim go, closes the door and heads to the alcove.\n\n                    IDA\n          He's gone. Brody and those boys are a\n          pain in the backside. I'm sure that\n          cousin of his had it coming.\n\nIda leads Mike back to the couch.\n\n                    MIKE\n          What did the Ranger say? Does he need\n          to speak to me? When is he coming?\n\nIda heads back to the kitchen, grabs a mug and pours hot\nwater into it. She dishes a small spoonful of yellow powder\ninto the hot water.\n\n                    IDA\n          Sorry, I wasn't able to reach anyone.\n\nIda stirs the powder in as she walks back to Mike.\n\n                    MIKE\n          God damnit!\n\nIda pauses...then:\n\n                    IDA\n          Please don't take the Lord's name in\n          vain in this house.\n\nShe GLARES LONG, COLD and HARD at Mike, until...\n\n                       MIKE\n          I'm sorry.\n\n                    IDA\n          Drink this.\n\n                                                     48.\n\n\nIda hands him the steaming mug.    Mike's mind races.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Something's not right.\n\n                    IDA\n          I'm sure they're just on rounds and\n          will be back any minute. We'll try\n          them again and we'll find Sheryl.\n          You'll see. She probably just took a\n          wrong turn up here, ended up in the\n          middle of \"don't know where.\" Happens\n          lots of times.\n              (Looks to the mug)\n          Please drink up, Michael, it will make\n          you feel better.\n\nMike holds the mug, stares at the drink. He puts it to his\nlips but then stops, looks at Ida. She stares at him.\n\nUnnerved by the stare, Mike lowers the mug without sipping.\n\n                    IDA\n          What's wrong?\n\n                    MIKE\n          How did you know my name?\n\n                     IDA\n              (Confused)\n          Excuse me?\n\n                    MIKE\n          Michael. You keep calling me Michael.\n          You did it just now. You did before,\n          just after I woke up. You called me\n          Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.\n\n                    IDA\n          I'm sure you're mistaken.    You musta\n          told me before.\n\n                    MIKE\n          No, I would have told you \"Mike.\"\n          Only my grandmother, who's dead, ever\n          called me Michael.\n\n                    IDA\n          Well, how else could I have known your\n          name?\n\nANGLE ON - IDA'S BOOTS.\n\n       SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006    49.\n\n\n                       MIKE\n                 (Beat; thinks...)\n             On my driver's license and credit\n             cards, it says Michael. If you stole\n             my wallet from the campsite... that's\n             how you'd have known.\n\nLong beat.\n\n                       IDA\n             You're accusing me of stealing your\n             wallet? I saved your life. Twice.\n             Why would I steal your wallet?\n                 (Mike doesn't respond)\n             Now, just drink your primrose...\n\n                       MIKE\n             Fuck the primrose!\n\nMike TOSSES the mug across the room.      It SHATTERS.\n\nMike lifts himself up. Despite the pain, he heads for the\nroom Ida went in to make the radio call.\n\n                       IDA\n             Where do you think you're going?\n\n                       MIKE\n             I want to call the Ranger myself.\n\n                       IDA\n             NO!\n\nIda springs to her feet, jumps in front of Mike.\n\n                       MIKE\n             I'm getting in that room, Ida.\n\nMike maneuvers around her, when... Ida grabs the iron fire\npoker by the stove, holds it like a baseball bat.\n\n                       IDA\n             I can't let you in there.\n\nMike takes a step forward. Ida SWINGS the poker. Nearly\nhits Mike. Mike jukes left, she SWINGS again. Misses.\n\n                       MIKE\n             Where is Sheryl, Ida?    She's in that\n             room, isn't she?\n\n                       IDA\n             You sinners are all alike. I heard\n             you last night.

Suddenly...\n\n     A SHADOW creeps into frame.   Then a BOOT.\n\n     REVEAL: IDA STANDS OUTSIDE THE TENT.\n\n                                                                BACK TO:\n\n57   INT.

The poker falls to\n     the floor.\n\n     Ida JUMPS on Mike's back, wraps her arms around his throat.\n\n     Mike spins Ida around in circles, then SLAMS Ida up against\n     the wall. The two fall to the floor.\n\n     Mike pushes himself up, but before he can get away...\n\n     IDA GRABS HOLD OF HIS BEAR TRAP WOUND, SQUEEZES!\n\n     MIKE SCREAMS IN AGONY! Instinctively, Mike kicks Ida in the\n     face, boot to nose. Ida's head snaps back, then falls face\n     first on the floorboard.\n\n     Mike is PANTING, glances at Ida.    She's out cold.\n\n     Mike pushes himself up, limps to the door.      He grabs the\n     handle, PUSHES IT OPEN...\n\n58   INT.   SEWING ROOM, IDA'S CABIN - DAY                            58\n\n     Mike enters to find a sewing machine, some yarn, an antique\n     radio, but more importantly, No Sheryl. He steps over to the\n     radio, when he notices...\n\n             SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006       51.\n\n\n     AN INCH THICK LAYER OF DUST COVERS THE RADIO. He swipes it\n     with his finger. This thing hasn't been used in years.\n\n     Mike turns, steps on a throw-rug laying in the center of the\n     floor... HIS FOOT SINKS a little. Mike tests the floor board\n     again. It's RICKETY. He pulls the rug out...\n\n     REVEAL: A TRAP DOOR.   Mike grabs the latch, lifts it open.\n\n59   INT.   TRAP DOOR STAIRCASE                                    59\n\n     FROM BELOW... Looking up past a weathered, worn and wooden\n     staircase up at Mike.\n\n     Carefully, Mike makes his way down the steps, into...\n\n60   INT.   CHAPEL - CABIN BASEMENT - DAY                          60\n\n     Religious artifacts, lots of them. Crosses, photos of Jesus,\n     statues of Mary, etc. Don the walls, shelves... everywhere.\n\n     On the far side of the room... like an altar shrine...   NINE\n     LARGE GLASS JARS FILLED WITH LIQUID...\n\n     INSIDE EACH JAR - HUMAN FETUSES, all in various stages of\n     development and DEFORMITY. Each jar is labelled with their\n     own individual bronze nameplate (#1, MATTHEW... #2, JOHN...\n     #3, PETER... #4, LUKE, etc...).\n\n     THE LAST JAR - The fetus is closest to term, maybe 8 months\n     along). The nameplate reads, \"TIMOTHY.\"\n\n     Mike, completely freaked out, backpedals, bumps into AN IRON\n     DOOR. He turns the handle, opens it...\n\n61   INT.   HALLWAY - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                         61\n\n     It's pitch black as Mike opens the door.   Next to the door, a\n     light switch... He flips it ON.\n\n     Sounding like small gunshots, a series of overhead lights\n     TURN ON illuminating a long, narrow, curved hallway. At the\n     far end... THREE DOORS. (RECOGNIZE THIS FROM THE OPENING\n     SCENE.) A sound. It's distant, muffled...indistinguishable.\n     Mike stirs, hearing the faint, muted sound from the end of\n     the hallway.\n\n     Mike staggers, leans against the wall for support. He's\n     woozy, but determined. He proceeds down the hall, towards\n     the doors.\n\n     Just as Mike passes underneath a light... POP! THE LIGHTS\n     EXPLODES. SPARKS, GLASS SHOWER onto Mike. As he brushes\n     himself off.\n\n                                                               52.\n\n\n     A SCREAM cries out.\n\n                             MIKE\n                Sheryl!?\n\n     Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the\n     door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and...\n\n62   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                  62\n\n     Mike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO\n     THE ROOM, falls across...\n\n     Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the\n     floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's\n     bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches.\n\n     Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock.     Euphoria, pain all at once.\n\n                             MIKE\n                Oh my God.\n\n     Mike runs to her, touches her face.    He checks the ropes\n     tying Sheryl. They're very secure.\n\n                          MIKE\n                I need something to cut you down,\n                baby.\n\n     Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room.\n\n     Mike follows her gaze... Searching wildly...       scanning the\n     room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS!\n\n     ON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and\n     unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT,\n     then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE.\n\n     Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl.      He slides the\n     blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES.      Several tense\n     moments later... the rope breaks.\n\n     Mike tosses the rope and gag away.    They kiss.\n\n                          MIKE\n                Are you okay?\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Get me out of here.

Mike quickly silences her.\n\nBREATHING INTENSIFIES.    Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each\nother's arms. Then...\n\nMike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT.      He\nfeels around for the bench, when... WHACK.\n\n                       MIKE\n           Fuck!\n\nHe banged his injured leg on something.\n\n                     SHERYL\n               (Whispers)\n           What are you doing?\n\nMike reaches the tool bench, feels around.

Mike can't breathe.\n\n     Mike smacks the Concealed Figure in the face, squirms, all to\n     no avail, until...\n\n     Mike JAMS his THUMB INTO HIS EYE.   He SCREAMS, DROPS Mike.\n     They both fall to the floor.\n\n     The fallen flashlight's beam illuminates Sheryl backed in the\n     corner.\n\n                          MIKE\n                    (To Sheryl)\n                Get the fuck out of here!

He pulls himself up using the bench for support. He\n     haphazardly feels for a weapon... any weapon.\n\n     He grabs a hammer, turns and...\n\n     The Figure grabs Mike's wrist, then HEAD-BUTTS MIKE between\n     the eyes.

Sheryl rushes into the room, but trips on something.\n     When she gets up, the first thing she sees... THE FETUS JARS!\n\n     She coughs violently, almost pukes.     She stumbles, hurries up\n     the trap door steps...\n\n     A moment later...\n\n     The Concealed Figure pops through the iron door.       For the\n     first time we see the Concealed Figure wholly...\n\n     THIS IS DEACON. Half his body scarred, burned. He stands\n     well over six feet tall, muscles rippling everywhere. A\n     frightful sight.\n\n     He peers up the trap door steps, pursues Sheryl...\n\n67   EXT.

Runs after her.\n\n68   EXT.   WOODS #4 - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       68\n\n     SHERYL runs as fast as she can. Breaking branches in her\n     way, leaping rocks.

She falls FACE FIRST INTO A GIANT PUDDLE. She pushes\n     herself out of the puddle. She's soaked, but doesn't stop.\n     She resumes running.\n\n     DEACON... closing the gap.\n\n     SHERYL, confused, scared and lost, looks around wildly.   Has\n     no idea where she's going. Then suddenly she hears\n     something. She looks down a slight hill...\n\n     SHERYL'S POV - A RANGER TRUCK drives along a gravel road.\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Thank you God...\n                    (At the top of her lungs)\n                HELP!\n\n     Sheryl darts down the hill, and falls out onto...\n\n69   I/E   RANGER TRUCK/ GRAVEL MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY              69\n\n     The RANGER TRUCK SLAMS on the brakes, inches from running\n     over Sheryl. She SLAMS her arms down on the hood.\n\n     Clyde, startled beyond belief, looks out at Sheryl. He gets\n     out of the car, goes to her. She HUGS Clyde tightly, starts\n     crying. He looks at her... the blood, cuts, etc.\n\n                          CLYDE\n                Oh my stars, what happened to you?\n\n                           SHERYL\n                     (Out of breath)\n                You have to help me.

No Deacon.\n\n                          CLYDE\n                Look, miss, there's no one there.\n\n                          SHERYL\n                Oh my God, Mike.\n\n                                                               57.\n\n\n     ANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles\n     Sheryl.

Ida walks right up to Sheryl.        She\n     places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit.\n\n                                                               58.\n\n\n                          IDA\n                Perfect.

He\n     wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope\n     gags his mouth.\n\n     ANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE.   As it moves towards Mike...\n\n     Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in\n     front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye.\n\n     An eye for an eye?\n\n     Mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake\n     loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but...\n\n                           CLYDE (O.S.)\n                Deacon!\n\n     Clyde enters.

He undoes a slipknot on the far wall,\n     which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon\n     lifts Mike to his feet, positions him.\n\n     It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room.\n\n     The FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN\n     CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and\n     everywhere.\n\n     An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the\n     corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE\n     WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's\n     hollow, full of static and futz.\n\n     Mike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as...\n\n                                                       59.\n\n\nThe iron door slowly CREAKS open.\n\nANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure\nthe ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time.\n\nShimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress\nand a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still\nbound. Her mouth gagged.\n\nMike and Sheryl take each other in. Tears spring to Sheryl's\neyes. She takes another jerky step closer.\n\nIda is visible behind her, guides her towards Mike. She\npositions her next to him so that both face the altar.\n\nClyde glances to Ida who silences the music.\n\n                    CLYDE\n          And Jesus answered and said unto them,\n          \"Each man should have his own wife,\n          and each woman her own husband.

Neither flinch.\n\nClyde glances to Deacon, who immediately steps forward,\ntouches the sickle blade to Sheryl's throat.\n\n                    CLYDE\n          I'll ask again... Do you accept this\n          covenant of marriage?\n\nSheryl nods immediately.   Mike nods too.\n\nClyde signals for Deacon to step back.   He obeys.\n\n                    CLYDE\n          Then by the power vested in me, I\n          pronounce you man and wife.\n\nClyde signals to Ida.\n\n                                                         60.\n\n\nIda removes Sheryl's graduation ring from her finger. She\nthen slides TWO TARNISHED GOLD BANDS, one on Sheryl's finger,\nthe other on Mike's.\n\nClyde unties the rope securing Mike's gag in his mouth,\nremoves it.\n\n                    MIKE\n          Why are you doing this? We did\n          nothing to you people. Let us go!\n\n                    CLYDE\n          You may kiss the bride.\n\n                    MIKE\n          You fucking people are fucking sick!\n\nClyde's temper flares...\n\n                    CLYDE\n              (Stern and cold)\n          Do not use that type of language in\n          this house again. Now... kiss the\n          bride or...\n              (Gestures to Deacon)\n          ... he'll cut off your lips.\n\nMike stares in horror at Clyde, turns to Sheryl.\n\n                    MIKE\n          I love you.\n\nMike kisses her briefly on the cheek.\n\nClyde smiles satisfied, nods to Deacon. He immediately lifts\nSheryl up and throws her over his shoulder.\n\n                    MIKE\n          What are you doing?\n\nDeacon carries her from the room.   Sheryl CRIES.\n\n                    MIKE\n          LET HER GO! SHERYL!\n              (To Clyde)\n          Let her go!...Please, let her go!\n\nClyde pulls the ropes, hoists Mike back into a dangling\nposition. He secures the knot before exiting the room.\n\n                    MIKE\n          SHERYL!\n              (To Ida)\n                    (MORE)\n\n                                                                   61.\n\n                            MIKE (cont'd)\n                  Please.

Perfect.\n\n       Ida exits the room.     Mike is alone.\n\n       Mike tries to yank his hands through the knot. His wrists\n       and hands turn red, his face is flushed...the knot is too\n       tight. He stops.\n\n       Mike takes a breath and tries again. His face and hands are\n       beet red. He pulls and pulls...but the rope doesn't budge.\n       Mike exhales. It's no use. He dangles there, helpless.\n\n72     EXT.

CHAPEL - NIGHT                                      74\n\n     Clyde sits in a chair next to Mike.\n\n                           CLYDE\n                Lord knows the will of a man gets\n                tested. Cruelly most times. But the\n                righteous persevere. They do what\n                needs to be done, even though they\n                don't want to. It's what makes a man,\n                a man. Let me tell you the story of\n                Judas, he was one of Jesus's apostles.\n                Judas led Roman Soldiers to the\n                capture and eventual death of our Lord\n                Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly\n                seated next to Satan, his soul burning\n                in hell forever for this sin. But I\n                don't believe that's the case. I have\n                my own theory. The death of Jesus was\n                predicted thousands of years before\n                Judas ever came along. And for the\n                prophecy to be fulfilled, Jesus had to\n                die. If he didn't, the gates of\n                heaven couldn't be opened for mankind.\n                I don't think, for an instant, Judas\n                wanted to be the one, but... someone\n                had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus\n                could die for our sins. Save us all.\n                And I believe at this moment...
