You never \n                         have to worry about that.\n\n<b>                                     SAMMY\n</b>                         Please don't go till you know where \n                         you're going. Please...!\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         I do know where I'm going. I'm going \n                         to Worcester and I'm gonna try to \n                         see that girl. And then depending on \n                         what happens there, I thought I'd \n                         try to see if there's any work for \n                         me out West. And if there is, I'm \n                         gonna head out there for the summer \n                         and try to make some money. And if \n                         there isn't, I'll figure something \n                         else out. Maybe I'll stay around the \n                         East. I don't know... I really liked \n                         it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. \n                         You just -- It made me feel good. \n                         And before things got so messed up I \n                         was doin' pretty well out there. \n                         Seriously. But I couldn't stay here \n                         long, Sammy: I don't want to live \n                         here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. \n                         And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to \n                         see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll \n                         come home for Christmas. How about \n                         that? We'll have Christmas together.\n                              (Pause)\n                         Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...\n\n               Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking \n               down her cheeks.\n\n<b>                                     TERRY\n</b>                         Come on, Sammy...

She passes the \n               TOWN HALL CLOCK and sees that it's 9:20.\n\n               She dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her \n               window to let the morning breeze blow through.\n\n               Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at \n               a slow and easy pace.\n\n<b>                                         THE END\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>You Can Count On Me</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Kenneth Lonergan\" title=\"Scripts by Kenneth Lonergan\">Kenneth Lonergan</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/You Can Count On Me Script.html#comments\" title=\"You Can Count On Me comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:20:53.901683"}
