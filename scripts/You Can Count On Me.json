The steeple of the \n               little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.\n\n               INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY\n\n               It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. \n               There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the \n               back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the \n               MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-\n               pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.\n\n               Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy, \n               both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes. \n               Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits \n               next to them.\n\n               Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his \n               eyes with his free hand.\n\n               The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is \n               hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his \n               eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another \n               minute.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

She is dressed in office \n               clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light \n               raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds \n               and then bows her head and closes her eyes.\n\n               CREDITS END.\n\n               EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY\n\n               Scottsville is a small town. Main Street.

World War II statue. Residential streets \n               wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know \n               there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity \n               during the daytime.\n\n               SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-\n               year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school \n               knapsack is waiting at the curb.

Now is there anybody \n                         else who can pick your son up after \n                         school? Does your husband work in \n                         the area? Do you --\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't \"on the \n                         scene.\" So to speak.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Well, I can give you a couple of \n                         days to make some other arrangement, \n                         but...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Well -- Brian? I understand what \n                         you're saying, and I think it's great. \n                         I do. Because there's a lot of things \n                         around here that could use some \n                         attention. Believe me. But I've \n                         honestly been meeting that bus every \n                         day for four years now and it really \n                         does take just fifteen minutes, and \n                         if I take the time out of my lunch \n                         hour...\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I'd really prefer it if you would \n                         make some other arrangement.

SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK\n\n               Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight \n               flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive \n               along.\n\n               EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK\n\n               The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' \n               more wear on it.\n\n               Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches \n               half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.\n\n               INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK\n\n               Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries. \n               Rudy follows, looking through the mail. Sammy passes through \n               the house and goes into the kitchen.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         You got a letter from Uncle Terry.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What?!\n\n               Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears \n               it open and reads it with growing excitement.\n\n               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER\n\n               Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household \n               files, miscellaneous files.\n\n               She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked \"Terry -- \n               Correspondence.\" The folder is stuffed with other letters, \n               on all different kinds of stationery from all over the \n               country, all from Terry.\n\n               INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT\n\n               Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for \n               just two people.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Whose room is he gonna stay in?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         He can stay in the little room.\n                              (Pause)\n                         But you know what? He's not going to \n                         live here. He's only gonna stay for \n                         a little while... And it's OK if you \n                         don't remember him, because you were \n                         only six the last time he was here... \n                         But it'll be nice if you got a chance \n                         to get to know each other a little \n                         bit. Don't you think?\n\n               Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER\n\n               Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition \n               notebook. Sammy comes downstairs.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Rudy?

She looks \n               at Rudy, who is writing away.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Did you think of a story?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Uh huh.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What's it about?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         My father.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What about your father?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         It's just a made-up story about him.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Can I read it when you're done?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         It's not very good.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Don't say that.\n\n               Rudy keeps writing.\n\n               INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER\n\n               Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine \n               and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her.\n\n               INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER\n\n               Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone. \n               She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length \n               mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better \n               judgment she picks up the phone and dials.\n\n               INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT\n\n               Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the \n               only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a \n               Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this \n                         adventure story, and Rudy's father \n                         is this secret agent or something, \n                         working for the government... And it \n                         just made me feel weird. You know? \n                         Because I never really say much to \n                         him about Rudy Sr., because I don't \n                         know what to say. And I don't know \n                         whether I should just let him imagine \n                         whatever he wants to imagine, or \n                         whether I should sit him down sometime \n                         and tell him, you know, that his \n                         father is not such a nice person. \n                         You know?\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Well... I don't know, Sammy. What \n                         have you told him already?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Not much. He knows I don't have the \n                         highest opinion of him. And he knows \n                         I don't want to see him or know \n                         anything about him, ever. But I tried \n                         to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... \n                         I could go into a lot more detail, \n                         believe me.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Well... It's an interesting problem. \n                         But I don't really know what to tell \n                         you... It's a little outside my \n                         personal field of expertise...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         All right.\n\n                                     BOB\n                         I'd be glad to give it some thought...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         OK.\n\n               He is smiling at her.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What?\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Nothing...

Sammy cuts at her steak.\n\n               INT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT\n\n               Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having \n               made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying \n               with difficulty not to let on.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         I should get going...\n\n                                     BOB\n                         Really?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Yeah...

Thank you.\n\n               She kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into \n               it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing.\n\n               INT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT\n\n               Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the \n               mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she \n               brushes.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT\n\n               A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not \n               much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet \n               neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.\n\n               TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real \n               mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very \n               old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a \n               wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty.\n\n               SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is \n               barely eighteen, frail and damaged.\n\n                                     SHEILA\n                         Hey, Terry.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Hey.\n\n               Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly.

Sorry.\n\n               As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward \n               her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives \n               Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Is that all you have?\n\n                                     SHEILA\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Can you borrow some cash from your \n                         brother?\n\n                                     SHEILA\n                         Um, yeah, but that would involve \n                         speaking to him.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Well, I'm definitely gonna be gone \n                         for a couple of days at least, Sheila.\n\n                                     SHEILA\n                         Why do you have to stay so long?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Because my sister is not a bank, you \n                         know?

NEW YORK STATE -- MOUNTAINS -- HIGHWAY. DAY\n\n               Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A \n               GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the \n               highway.\n\n               INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY\n\n               Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom \n               smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as \n               long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes \n               another equally huge hit and holds it in.\n\n               EXT. LOCAL HIGHWAY. DAY\n\n               The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-\n               coaster road.\n\n               INT. BUS (MOVING). DAY\n\n               Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery. The \n               sunlight flickers on his face.\n\n               POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.\n\n               Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.\n\n               POV TERRY: THE \"WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE\" SIGN whizzes by. \n               Houses start dotting the side of the road.\n\n               Terry starts getting very agitated.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY\n\n               Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his \n               shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town \n               going about its Saturday afternoon business.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS\n\n               Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an \n               apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and \n               hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence \n               of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and \n               takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She \n               picks up.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                              (Into phone)\n                         Hello?... TERRY!...\n\n               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY\n\n               Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed \n               into nice clothes.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY. DAY\n\n               Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out \n               his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he \n               looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny \n               man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake \n               hands. Terry says \"Hi,\" but keeps on walking. He passes some \n               other people.\n\n               He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter \n               and grayer.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Whoa there!\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Sorry.\n\n               The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         God damn! Terry Prescott! How you \n                         doin'? Gimme a cuddle!\n\n               The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and \n               selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         How you doin', Darryl?\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Which way you headed?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         I'm just goin' to see Sammy at \n                         Dawson's...\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Can I walk with you a little?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Sure, yeah --\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         So Sammy says you been out in \n                         Alaska...?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Yeah, I was workin' out there for a \n                         little while...\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n               The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious \n               about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The \n               Sheriff does not seem to notice.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         -- Sammy says she's gettin' postcards \n                         from all across the country.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Yeah, I've been all over the place...\n\n               They stop outside Dawson's.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Well, it's good to have you back \n                         here, I'll tell you that.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Thanks, Darryl. Keep enforcing the \n                         peace.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Well, that'll be a little harder now \n                         that you're home, but I'll do what I \n                         can.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         No, man, I'm reformed.\n\n                                     SHERIFF\n                         Oh, yeah. Good to see you, kid.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Thanks, Darryl.\n\n               Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking \n               for Sammy.\n\n               Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, \n               talking to the waitress.\n\n               She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy \n               as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.\n\n               Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses \n               his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window \n               we see them make their way toward each other.\n\n               Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a \n               big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.\n\n               INT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER\n\n               Terry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming \n               at him.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Sorry about yesterday --\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         I don't care --\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         I was studying the bus description... \n                         and I just...

He sees Sammy \n               standing in the doorway.

On the coffee table \n               are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies \n               box and a milk carton.\n\n               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE.

Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up \n               and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with \n               no great skill.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Hey.

IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER\n\n               Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the \n               hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the \n               side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering \n               happily away with Terry and Ray.\n\n               She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance \n               and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a \n               very cheerful sight.\n\n               INT.

Plus it was pretty scummy \n                         how he split on your mom and you... \n                         He was a prick. Probably still a \n                         prick. Fortunately for you though, \n                         your mom is like, the greatest.

TERRY steps up to the table, chalking \n               up his cue.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Boys, it's all over but the cryin'.\n\n               QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching. \n               Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball \n               off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball \n               into the side. Rudy watches him.\n\n               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. NIGHT\n\n               Bob and Sammy sit at Bob's dining room table. The little \n               bachelor apartment looks pretty good. Tablecloth, candles, \n               wine, everything. Bob has just dropped a huge bombshell.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Bob...

In \n                         the past... I don't know: I'm tired \n                         of foolin' around.

Fair enough.\n\n               INT. WILD MOOSE. NIGHT\n\n               Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over \n               to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully, \n               and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the \n               corner pocket.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Ohhhh!\n\n               A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching \n               as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them \n               and the camera, running the table. \"Oohs\" and \"All rights\" \n               emit from the spectators.\n\n               Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A \n               great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         It's all yours, baby.\n\n               Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off \n               the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A \n               piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.\n\n               He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is \n               right next to him.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Just make sure to hit it really \n                         gentle. But firm. And hit it a little \n                         low so you get some backspin. Don't \n                         even hit it. Just kiss it.\n\n               A long moment.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         What do you mean, kiss it?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         I mean tap it. Firm but very, very \n                         softly. And don't shoot until you \n                         know it's going in. OK?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         OK.\n\n               Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice \n               strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. \n               It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, \n               slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.\n\n               A GENERAL \"HEYYY!\" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers. \n               Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         That was great!\n\n               AT THE BAR: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies, drinking a \n               pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.\n\n               AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside \n               down. Rudy laughs.\n\n               EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT\n\n               The house is dark. Terry and Rudy are walking from the car \n               to the house.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         We creamed those guys!

Don't move.\n\n               They listen. A CAR is COMING.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         It's them!\n\n               They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key. He gets \n               the door open.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Go! Go! Go!\n\n               He and Rudy run inside the house. The lights go on. BOB'S \n               CAR pulls into the DRIVEWAY.\n\n               INT. THE HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. SIMULTANEOUS\n\n               Rudy runs up the stairs.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Wait a minute, gimme your jacket!\n\n               Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught \n               in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         What are you doing?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         I can't get my sleeve out...!\n\n               They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked \n               face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he \n               drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:\n\n               Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the \n               top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically \n               trying to get the jacket off.\n\n               Sammy comes in. They freeze.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What is going on in here?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Um -- We were just out doing some \n                         star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track \n                         of the time.

DAY\n\n               The rain comes down hard on Orrin's construction project. \n               Tarps cover everything. No work today.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET -- LUNCH PLACE. DAY\n\n               The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the \n               restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter. \n               He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to \n               her.

O.C. we LOUD BANGING ON THE PIPES.\n\n               LATER: A YOUNG PLUMBER, about Terry's age, comes thumping \n               down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his \n               toolbox. Terry looks up at him.\n\n                                     PLUMBER\n                         OK, you're all set.\n\n               Terry glares at him. The plumber turns and goes out.\n\n               EXT. BUS STOP. DAY\n\n               RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold. \n               The RAIN pours down.\n\n               INT. BANK. DAY\n\n               Brian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very \n               solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees, \n               who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm \n               mood either; she's very testy with Brian.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         This is Chuck.

Nobody is being very friendly, \n               and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and \n               Nancy reach Sammy's desk.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         This is Sammy, our lending officer. \n                         Sammy, this is my wife, Nancy.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                              (Friendly)\n                         Hi.

He murmurs something to Nancy, \n               who responds in a low but very testy voice:\n\n                                     NANCY\n                         I'm fine...!\n\n               She roughly pulls her arm away from his.

NIGHT\n\n               Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car. \n               This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         Sammy?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Yeah?\n\n                                     BRIAN\n                         I want you to tell me who changed \n                         the colors on my computer screen.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         I'll never tell.\n\n               They start kissing again in the cramped space.

The sodden trees spout \n               faucets of water down on the car.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT\n\n               The kitchen is dark.

He looks at the tombstones for a moment. He \n               puts his hand on top of one headstone, then the other.\n\n               He sits down and smokes. He looks up at the SKY. It's a \n               beautiful deep blue sky dotted with billowy white clouds.\n\n               He looks out over the hilly scenery.

SAMMY HONKS for the bus driver, and Sammy, \n               Terry and Rudy all get out.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         So Rudy... If I write you a letter, \n                         will you write me back?\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Yeah.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         OK, well, that's gonna be pretty \n                         nice for you, because I write a pretty \n                         Goddamn interesting letter.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Yeah, we'll see.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         All right. Well, say good-bye.\n\n                                     RUDY\n                         Bye.\n\n               Rudy hugs Terry. Terry hugs him back. He is suddenly overcome \n               and presses his lips to the top of Rudy's head.\n\n               Rudy walks to the BUS and gets on. The bus pulls away.\n\n               Alone now, Sammy and Terry are not that comfortable. He moves \n               to get back in the car, and she does the same.\n\n               EXT. BENCH. DAY\n\n               Sammy and Terry sit on a bench near the bus stop. Terry's \n               backpack is by his side.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Do you need some cash for the bus?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         No, I got a few bucks... Aren't you \n                         gonna be late for work?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Oh -- Yeah. That's OK.\n                              (Pause)\n                         Terry, I don't even know where you're \n                         going.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Oh, well, I didn't really have a \n                         concrete plan yet. I have to go back \n                         to Worcester and get my stuff...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Oh, are you gonna try to see that \n                         girl?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Well... Yeah... You know... Thought \n                         maybe I'd try to show my face... Let \n                         her brother have a crack at me...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         No...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         ...I don't want anyone to have a \n                         crack at you.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         I'm just kidding. I just thought... \n                         Just thought I'd check up on her...\n                              (Pause)\n                         Anyway, after that, I don't really \n                         know. I've been thinking about Alaska \n                         a lot. I still got some friends out \n                         there. I don't really know. Anyway, \n                         I'll write you.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         You will?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Sure, Sammy. Of course I will. You \n                         know that.\n\n               Pause.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         What is gonna happen to you?\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Nothing too bad... But I gotta tell \n                         you, I know things didn't work out \n                         too well this time...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Well, Terry --\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         ...but it's always really good to \n                         know that wherever I am, whatever \n                         stupid shit I'm doing, you're back \n                         at my home, rooting for me.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         I do root for you.\n\n               She starts crying, and looks down.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Come on, Sammy. Everything's gonna \n                         be all right... Comparatively... And \n                         I'll be back this way...\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         I feel like I'm never gonna see you \n                         again...!\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Of course you will, Sammy. You never \n                         have to worry about that.\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Please don't go till you know where \n                         you're going. Please...!\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         I do know where I'm going. I'm going \n                         to Worcester and I'm gonna try to \n                         see that girl. And then depending on \n                         what happens there, I thought I'd \n                         try to see if there's any work for \n                         me out West. And if there is, I'm \n                         gonna head out there for the summer \n                         and try to make some money. And if \n                         there isn't, I'll figure something \n                         else out. Maybe I'll stay around the \n                         East. I don't know... I really liked \n                         it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. \n                         You just -- It made me feel good. \n                         And before things got so messed up I \n                         was doin' pretty well out there. \n                         Seriously. But I couldn't stay here \n                         long, Sammy: I don't want to live \n                         here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. \n                         And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to \n                         see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll \n                         come home for Christmas. How about \n                         that? We'll have Christmas together.\n                              (Pause)\n                         Come on, Sammy. You can trust me...\n\n               Still looking down, Sammy shakes her head, tears leaking \n               down her cheeks.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Come on, Sammy... Look at me... Look \n                         at me...\n\n               She looks at him.\n\n                                     TERRY\n                         Hey, Sammy... Remember when we were \n                         kids, remember what we always used \n                         to say to each other . . .?\n                              (Pause)\n                         Remember when we were kids?\n\n                                     SAMMY\n                         Of course I do...!\n\n               She throws her arms around his neck. He pats her gently.\n\n               INT./EXT. BUS. DAY\n\n               The DOORS OPEN and Terry comes up the steps and into the \n               bus. Outside, Sammy watches him pay the driver and move \n               through the bus toward his seat. The BUS DOORS CLOSE.\n\n               EXT. BUS. CONTINUOUS\n\n               Sammy waves till the BUS DRIVES all the way down MAIN STREET, \n               turns a corner and is gone.\n\n               INT. BUS. CONTINUOUS\n\n               Terry, in his seat, turns forward and watches the view go \n               by. He smiles a little.\n\n               INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY\n\n               The morning sunlight flickers through the windshield into \n               the car as Sammy drives along toward work. She passes the \n               TOWN HALL CLOCK and sees that it's 9:20.\n\n               She dries her damp cheek with a forearm and rolls down her \n               window to let the morning breeze blow through.\n\n               Squaring her shoulders a little, she drives through town at \n               a slow and easy pace.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\nYou Can Count On Me\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Kenneth Lonergan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:39:10.683573"}
