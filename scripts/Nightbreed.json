TITLE SEQUENCE\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Darkness. Then, a burst of sparks from a bowl held in a scaly hand.\n          The light shows us a mural. We start to move along the wall. First we\n          see stars and planets, painted in a primitive, stylized fashion on\n          bare rock. A voice on the track speaks softly to us.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          VOICE: We did not always live in hiding.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          We have come to the image of a huge family tree, which springs from\n          a single seed but divides into two separate halves. On the left,\n          ruled by the moon, the branches blossom into extraordinary creatures.\n          On the right, by sunlight, the branches end in ordinary human beings.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Upon the word Nightbreed the title comes up on the screen, against\n          the image of a moon painted on the wall.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          SCENES 2-2K Deleted\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2L. EXT. REEDS NIGHT\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Cut to a real moon. Then cut wide to a moonlit landscape, through\n          which the camera careens madly. The soundtrack, which was lush and\n          almost sacred in the mural chamber, erupts into a tribal rhythm. We\n          glimpse creatures in the darkness, moving through the reeds. They are\n          barely more than silhouettes. We see teeth, and gleaming eyes;\n          glimpses of naked, patterned flesh. Only glimpses.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2M. INT. MURAL CHAMBER\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Cut back to the mural chamber. Now we have moved away from the tree\n          to a more brutal scene. A symbolic representation of a great\n          apocalyptic war between Naturals and Breed. Terrible scenes of\n          destruction.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          VOICE: But the Naturals made war on us. They feared us for our\n          strength. They envied our powers. They called us monsters, killing us\n          by whatever means their malice could invent, finding in each of us\n          our particular vulnerability. \n\n<b>          \n</b>          We are scanning scenes of that war. A breed being staked like a\n          vampire. Another being shot like a werewolf. Another exposed to\n          sunlight.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          VOICE: None of us was safe. The tribes of the moon dwindled. Our\n          gods were slaughtered, our homes destroyed. It was the Apocalypse.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2N. EXT. NECROPOLIS WALL AND GATES\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Cut back to the landscape. The clouds roil above the heads of the\n          creatures heading through the reeds. We see their destination now. A\n          huge wall, with gates.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2P. INT. MURAL CHAMBER\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          And back to the mural chamber, and a final scene. The gates we've\n          just seen are in the painting. Looking over them, calling the Breed\n          in, is a vast indistinct form: that of Baphomet. His eyes burn; his\n          arms are open in welcome.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          VOICE: Only one of our Gods survived the holocaust. Baphomet.\n          Wounded and near death, he summoned us, the last of the last, into\n          hiding. Into Midian, where we wait now. The battle is over but not\n          the war. There will come a saviour.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Now we've moved beyond the image of the gate into a new patch of\n          wall on which the pictures are only vague sketches. We can interpret\n          some of the images nevertheless: a man with a bloody hole in the\n          middle of his chest. A man wearing a mask like a skull. We linger on\n          a faceless figure.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          VOICE: His name is Cabal. He will lead and give us back the Night.\n          We are the tribes of the moon. We are the Nightbreed.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The titles end.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2Q. EXT.

Only one, a beautiful,\n          ferocious female called Shuna Sassi remains, turning to look at us.\n          She beckons.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          SHUNA: Come...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The camera retreats from her.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          SHUNA: Will you not come?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Now the last of the creatures, the Drummer, takes her by the arm,\n          snatching her away through the gates. As she disappears, the camera\n          follows again, stopping at the gates themselves, which close with an\n          unearthly din.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          CUT TO: \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2R.

His gaze roves beneath\n          his lids.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori's lips come into shot kissing first his eyes and then traveling\n          down his face to his mouth.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: Boone...wake up.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone's eyes flicker open.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: Hi.

It is unmade. Both Lori and Boone are\n          lightly dressed, clothes casually thrown on after an afternoon\n          lovemaking.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori: You know what?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: What?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: We should get out of Calgary for a few days.

But we hear his labours:\n          the sound of the blades slicing Melissa. She staggers into view,\n          grabbing hold of her slit throat.

DR DECKER'S OFFICE DAY\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Close on a pile of tapes, marked with dates over a period of two\n          years. They're on Decker's desk.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: I've been listening to the tapes of our sessions. All two\n          years' worth...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          We move from the tapes to Decker, who gets up from his desk and\n          moves around to the other side. Boone is sitting on the other side of\n          the desk, his posture far from relaxed. He hates this room. As Decker\n          moves, we take in the various pictures on the walls. Dance pictures,\n          photographs of Decker with civic dignitaries, crippled children etc.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: Why?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: Most of my colleagues would have walked away from a case\n          like yours. The most they would have done was drug you. But you...you\n          intrigued me. All the talk of monsters. And Midian. Remember Midian?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: That wasn't me. I heard about Midian from other people.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: But you made it part of your private mythology.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: I suppose I did. It was a place of refuge.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: When you imagined yourself being taken off to this invented\n          city, to Midian, what crimes were you going to be forgiven?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone's looking uneasy now. He wipes sweat from his upper lip.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: You know what I used to dream.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: Yes. There's a remarkable consistency in the images you see.\n          Great detail. Almost as though the violence was real.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: They were just bad dreams. Midian doesn't exist. Monsters\n          don't exist. \n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: But murder does, Boone. Murder's very real. It may start in\n          the mind, but it ends up changing to flesh and blood.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          He picks up the envelope we saw in his previous scene, and takes the\n          photographs out.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER [cont.]: Two days ago the police brought me some\n          photographs. They wanted to know if I had any patients who might be\n          capable of what's in these photographs. I'm going to show you them.\n          Are you ready for that?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone nods.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Decker lays the photographs on the table. Boone picks them up. We\n          get glimpses of what they contain. Domestic horrors. Bloody scenes of\n          corpses caught by the camera in grotesque positions, sliced up and\n          bleeding. Boone's breath quickens.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER [cont.]: When you talk about murder on the tapes, I thought\n          it was invention. Now I'm not so sure.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone keeps staring at the pictures. The glassy eyes stare hard at\n          him. His breathing is now rapid and shallow. One or two of the images\n          seem to move. Bodies twitch. He drops the photographs.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: I didn't...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: Didn't what?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: They were bad dreams.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: What you describe in your sessions is very specific. Houses;\n          faces...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: I don't remember.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: You want to hear?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: No!\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Decker picks up the photographs.

We've come a\n          long way together.

God, tell me what to do.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: I can only go so far on your behalf. Patient\n          confidentiality's one thing. Protecting a killer is another.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE [breaking down]: Jesus...Jesus...Jesus...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Decker returns to his desk. Puts the photographs down and picks up a\n          vial of prescription pills. He crosses to boone.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER: Listen to me. Take these, they'll help. Go home, and\n          consider what we've talked about. I'm going to give you twenty-four\n          hours to go to the police and answer their questions of your own\n          accord. That's as long as I can give you. if you haven't complied by\n          then, I'm afraid I'll have to tell them what I know.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone grabs the pills.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          DECKER [cont.]: I can't tell you how sorry I am...\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          30.

The flesh beneath is\n          cauterized.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LYLESBURG: The blood of the God tells all truths. It can harm as\n          easily as heal. Are you prepared to be judged?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: I'm ready.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lylesburg nods, and puts his hand into the bowl of the blood. The\n          blood bubbles around his wrist.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          We cut to Peloquin and Shuna Sassi, who are watching Boone intently.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone's eyes are now on Lylesburg's smoking hand as it approaches\n          Boone's chest, still marked by his wounds.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LYLESBURG: Be judged.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          He puts his hand on the bullet wounds. Boone stiffens. But there's\n          no pain. When Lylesburg's hand is removed, the wounds have gone.\n          There's a visible release of tension on the faces of all those\n          watching.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LYLESBURG: Aaron Boone, in the name of Baphomet, Lord of the tribes\n          of the moon, I bid you welcome...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The camera moves out of the chamber, and towards the mural.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          97.

The atmosphere's got to her.\n          She starts back to the car.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          She catches some movement out of the corner of her eye.

EXT. NECROPOLIS GATES DAY\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori reaches the gates, slightly breathless. She pushes one of them\n          open. The sun is hot and bright, transforming the Necropolis from the\n          dark, dangerous place it was when Boone was here. Now, with its\n          gothic tombs and burgeoning plant life, it's almost welcoming.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          104. EXT. NECROPOLIS DAY\n</b>\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori wanders the walkways, enchanted by the splendor of the place.\n          There are strange, bittersweet sights along the way: statues of dogs\n          sleeping on their masters' graves; of mourning mothers; of children,\n          sitting at their graves. And grotesque images too: gargoyles\n          protecting the doorways of mausoleums; a tiger, roaring in stone. It\n          is another world, solemn and silent.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Except...suddenly, the sound of an animal in pain. Lori stops and\n          looks around. Her gaze comes to rest on a spreading laurel tree\n          beneath which the shadows are pitch black. From here, the sobbing\n          comes. She approaches. There is an animal beneath the tree, barely\n          discernible. She can see its flanks panting, its head moving in pain.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: Jesus...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          It doesn't look like a recognizable species, an amalgam of wild cat\n          and deer. She approaches. It raises its head, weakly. Its eyes are\n          huge and black.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI [cont.]: ...It's okay, I won't hurt you...it's okay...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The creature shudders.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI [cont.]: ...What's happened to you?...Let me see.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          She reaches beneath the branches and tentatively strokes the animal.\n          It responds by dropping its head back on to the grass.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI [cont.]: Oh God...you poor thing...don't die, please don't die.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          She pushes beneath the tree, puts her arms beneath the creature and\n          picks it up. It is heavy, a dead weight in her arms. She backs out\n          from beneath the tree. As she steps back into the sun, the creature\n          snarls and starts to wither in her arms. She realizes what's causing\n          it pain and steps back into shadow.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI [cont.]: You don't like the sun? Is that it?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The sound of sobbing, off to her left, draws her attention. One of\n          the mausoleum doors is open, and a woman, Rachel, dressed in black,\n          stands in the shadows, weeping. Lori's astonished.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI [cont.]: I'm sorry...is, is it yours?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          RACHEL: Bring her.

Please, bring me my Babette.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          As the creature is named it starts to move in Lori's arms. Not only\n          move, but change.

Appalled, she tries to pull the\n          transforming creature off her, but its hold is firm.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: Jesus! Jesus!\n\n<b>          \n</b>          With effort, she detaches the creature's claws from her, almost\n          throwing it at Rachel, who cradles the changing creature in her arms.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          RACHEL: Babette...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori leans against the wall, trying to wipe the sticky fluids the\n          creature's exuded onto her hands. When she looks up she sees the\n          creature in Rachel's arms has transformed into a pale, beautiful girl\n          of seven or eight. Lori's dumbstruck.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: What...what...what the...?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          RACHEL: She likes to play outside.

She doesn't\n          understand.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Lori looks back towards the open door, and the sun-drenched walkway\n          outside. Then back at Babette.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          LORI: This is too weird.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          RACHEL [an urgent whisper]: You saved her.

The fighters connect and\n          struggle, their violent motion carrying them over the edge of the\n          bridge, dropping them down another level. Decker lands very heavily,\n          and lies still. Boone gets up. His exit along the bridge in one\n          direction is blocked. He has to step past Decker who doesn't\n          move. Only when Boone has stepped beyond him does Decker get up,\n          pursuing Boone across the bridge, and flinging one of the\n          knives at his victim's back. The blade cuts straight through Boone,\n          sticking out from his chest a good six inches. He turns, his fury\n          transforming him into a more extreme creature. Decker comes at Boone\n          with a second blade, slashing at Boone's neck. The battle carries\n          them off the bridge onto the stairs. Decker takes hold of Boone's\n          hair, preparing to deliver the coup de grace. Boone reaches for a\n          weapon, finds a skull, and smashes it into the mask. Decker lets go.\n          Boone tumbles off the stairs, falling face down on a card table.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Decker follows down the stairs. Boone pulls the table off his chest,\n          leaving the Ace of Hearts on the blade in his chest. Decker follows\n          through, driving Boone back into one of the Breed's rooms, where the\n          fight continues. Decker takes a whip from the wall and uses it to\n          disarm Boone, who has snatched up a bone to defend himself with.\n          Boone snatches up a second bone and retaliates, delivering blow after\n          blow against Decker, eventually knocking the knife from his hand and\n          driving him out on to the ledge once more. Decker teeters on the\n          edge, now defenceless. Boone approaches.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BOONE: Want to dance?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          He snatches the mask off Decker's face and draws him close, impaling\n          Decker on his own blade. Decker screams.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Then Boone pushes him off the blade, and over the edge of the ledge.\n          Decker falls.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Boone stands on the ledge, and spits down at the corpse. As he does\n          so he hears the same roar from Baphomet that called the\n          Berserkers from harming him. Out of it, comes Baphomet's face.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          BAPHOMET [V.O.]: Boone!\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          244A. INT.

They are wrapping severed limbs of\n          Baphomet, preparing to include him in the exodus. His head and\n          shoulders remain suspended in the light. Baphomet's lips move, making\n          a terrible, eloquent sound.

The walls are\n          blackened by fires that are almost extinguished; corpses [human and\n          Breed] lie in barely distinguishable bundles, from which partially\n          cremated limbs jut. Smoke hangs in the air. From the distance we see\n          Eigerman, going amongst the corpses, reclaiming guns, bullets and\n          grenades. As we get closer we realize that he is a broken man, his\n          face dirty, his eyes lunatic. He's been crying, the tracks marking\n          the dirt.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Suddenly, he hears a noise, and stands up to see a large figure\n          appearing from the smoke.

It's Ashberry. He\n          has been transformed by the confrontation with Baphomet. His hair has\n          been almost burned away entirely and there is a subtle\n          reconfiguration in the shape of his skull. His clothes are in\n          tatters. There are hints that his once broken body, poisoned by\n          alcohol, has taken on new strength. He looks as insane as Eigerman,\n          but stronger in his lunacy. There's a dangerous fervour in his eyes.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          ASHBERRY: I saw their God...I saw him...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          EIGERMAN: What the hell are you talking about?\n\n<b>          \n</b>          ASHBERRY: I can still smell him.

He takes hold of Eigerman by\n          the neck, his fingers digging into the muscle. Blood runs. Eigerman\n          tries to raise the gun but Ashberry takes hold of the man's hand, and\n          summarily snaps his wrist. The gun is dropped. Ashberry starts to\n          lift Eigerman up off the ground. The policeman's flailings stop\n          suddenly. The head lolls. Ashberry flings the body aside, and starts\n          out of the Necropolis.

It\n          tells, in a rush of images, the story of the ruin of Midian.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Camera comes to a stop on the final image: Cabal and Lori, as we\n          just saw them, on a hill, framed against the star-filled heavens.\n\n<b>          \n</b>          The sound of the wind...\n\n<b>          \n</b>          Fade to black.\n<b> \n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Nightbreed.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Nightbreed</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Clive Barker\" title=\"Scripts by Clive Barker\">Clive Barker</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Action\" title=\"Action Scripts\">Action</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Nightbreed Script.html#comments\" title=\"Nightbreed comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:30.255857"}
