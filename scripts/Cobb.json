SNOW COVERED MOUNTAIN PASS - HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Stump's car passes a sign that tells all:    DONNER PASS.\n                                STUMP (V.O.)\n                  I confess I was looking forward\n                  to seeing Cobb and being near\n                  his brilliance. My own life\n                  seemed on hold, somehow. Everyday\n                  churning out the same old articles,\n                  drinking at 4 in the afternoon\n                  with the same old guys, the same\n                  old excuses for not writing a\n                  novel, the same old confused\n                  marriages that we all needed\n                  and were trying to get out of\n                  at the same time... Cobb was a\n                  god whose brilliance, however\n                  difficult, could rub off on\n                  me. His problems were different\n                  than mine...\n\n\n14   ANGLE ON STUMP'S CAR                                        14\n     which pulls off the road and heads up a small mountain\n     road among snow-covered pines.\n\n     A row of mailboxes catches Stump's attention, and he\n     pulls over to review the names with a flashlight. He\n     lights his way across the names of a dozen boxes --\n     nothing, until:\n     The last box, enormously oversized, bears the name \"COBB.\"\n\n\n     CLOSE ON STUMP\n     He smiles.    Perfect.\n\n\n     BACK TO SCENE\n     His car heads up a mountain road a final hundred yards,\n     comes around a bend in the trees and there it is --\n\n                                                           15.\n\n14   POV SHOT - HUGE MOUNTAIN LODGE                              14\n     In the grand style but, like the mailbox, grotesquely\n     oversized.\n\n                                               CUT TO:\n\n15   EXT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT                                 15\n\n     Stump parks and approaches somewhat warily.\n     The sound of BREAKING GLASS and SHOUTING voices.\n\n     Stump hurries to the door to escape the rain and finds\n     refuge under the eave. The noise is frightening from\n     that close. He stands unsurely -- does he knock?\n     When --\n\n     The door is thrown open -- a black man, WILLIE, 40, with\n     a suitcase stands wildly upset, screaming back into the\n     house.\n                            WILLIE\n              Fuck you, Mr. Cobb, I have too much\n              dignity to spend another moment\n              with you. I hope you die before\n              the sun comes up and may you rot\n              in hell!\n     The man whirls and is shocked to see Stump standing\n     there with his own suitcase.\n                              WILLIE\n              Who are you?\n\n                              STUMP\n              I'm a writer.\n\n                            WILLIE\n              You mean he actually found somebody\n              to take the job?\n\n     Willie bursts out into crazed laughter, as if the world\n     of Cobb was finally too absurd. Cobb and a writer? In\n     this weather? In any weather? And the man walks through\n     the rain, laughing, heading on foot down off the mountain\n     as Stump just stares.\n\n     Stump turns and steps into the open doorway.\n                                               CUT TO:\n\n                                                              16.\n\n16   INT. MOUNTAIN LODGE - NIGHT                                    16\n     Stump in the front door -- The place is enormous and\n     barely lit. Taxidermied game hangs on the wall.\n     Stump is terrified.\n     A MAN is sitting in an overstuffed chair reading a news-\n     paper. Dressed in a business suit and tie, he seems\n     oblivious to the surrounding chaos. He also seems out of\n     place.\n                             STUMP\n               Mr. Cobb?\n\n     The man looks at Stump and points upstairs without\n     speaking.\n\n     More CRASHING sounds from upstairs.\n\n                             STUMP\n               Mr. Cobb?\n     The silence is shattered by a SCRATCH, then VIOLIN MUSIC\n     from upstairs. STATIC suggests a record is playing.\n\n\n17   ANGLE ON STAIRS                                                17\n     Stump climbs the stairs with caution -- Until he's just\n     outside the half open door from which light spills. He\n     hesitates...\n                              STUMP\n               Hello?   Mr. Cobb?\n     A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT -- Ripping through the door.

Silence.   Then the\n     voice --\n                             COBB\n               Yes, Mr. Stump -- you do need this\n               job that bad.\n                             (MORE)\n                                                   (CONTINUED)\n\n                                                              17.\n\n17   CONTINUED:                                                      17\n                                COBB (CONT'D)\n                         (beat)\n                  Now come in here and meet the great\n                  Ty Cobb.\n                         (calmly)\n                  I won't hurt you.\n\n     Stump breathes deeply and steps into the doorway -- He\n     does it as if there's no choice, accepting his fate.

And\n     as the pitch arrives in the Catcher's hands, the Catcher\n     digs in to take on Cobb --\n     Cobb slides spikes high, flying above the earth, his back\n     leg slashing his spikes like knives. It is a slide of\n     utter defiance and violence, a slide intended to harm.\n     A vicious collision between Cobb and the catcher -- blood\n     and dust. The ball rolls free.
