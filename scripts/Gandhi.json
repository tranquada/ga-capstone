We are high and \n               far away, only the sound of the wind as we grow nearer and \n               nearer, and through the passing clouds these words appear:\n\n               \"No man's life can be encompassed in one telling. There is \n               no way to give each year its allotted weight, to include \n               each event, each person who helped to shape a lifetime. What \n               can be done is to be faithful in spirit to the record, and \n               to try to find one's way to the heart of the man...\"\n\n               And now we are approaching the city, the squalor of the little \n               shanty dwellings around the outskirts, the shadows of large \n               factories... And as we move nearer, coursing over the parched \n               terrain, the tiny fields of cultivation, strands of sound \n               are woven through the main titles, borne on the wind, images \n               from the life we are seeking:\n\n               British: \"Who the hell is he?!\", lower class British: \"I \n               don't know, sir.\"... \"My name is Gandhi. Mohandas K. \n               Gandhi.\"... A woman's voice, tender, soft: \"You are my best \n               friend, my highest guru... and my sovereign lord.\"... A man \n               (Gandhi): \"I am asking you to fight!\"... An angry aristocratic \n               English voice: \"At home children are writing 'essays' about \n               him!\"... the sound of massed rifle fire, screams...\n\n<b>               EXTERIOR - CITY - DAY\n</b>\n               And now we are over the city, coming in toward a particular \n               street in the affluent suburbs of New Delhi... there are a \n               few cars (it is 1948), and we are closing on a milling crowd \n               near the entrance to one of the larger homes.\n\n               We see saris, Indian tunics, a sprinkling of \"Gandhi\" caps, \n               several tongas (two-wheeled, horse-drawn taxis)... the shreds \n               of sound continue -- American woman, flirtatious, intimate: \n               \"You're the only man I know who makes his own clothes.\" \n               Gandhi's laugh... The sound of rioting, women's cries and \n               screams of terror... An American voice: \"This man of peace\"...\n\n               And as the titles end we begin to pick up the sounds of the \n               street... an Australian and his wife, a BBC correspondent... \n               all in passing, as the camera finally closes and holds on \n               one young man: Godse.\n\n<b>               BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Godse steps from a tonga as the crowd begins to move toward \n               an entrance-way at the back of a long wall.\n\n<b>                                     HOUSE SERVANT'S VOICE\n</b>                         He will be saying prayers in the \n                         garden -- just follow the others.\n\n               In contrast to those about him, there is tension in Godse's \n               face, an air of danger in his movements.\n\n               He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed \n               in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another tonga \n               that pulls up just behind his. Two young men (Apte and \n               Karkare) meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of \n               imminent danger.\n\n               They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes \n               watching the crowd.\n\n               Sitting along in the shadows of a stationary tonga a little \n               distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with a \n               short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a \n               cadaver is watching...\n\n               Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest \n               acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, \n               as though to tell them to be about their business.\n\n<b>               THE GATE AT BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who \n               nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, \n               cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then \n               glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is \n               as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, \n               wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a \n               group going through the gate.\n\n<b>               GARDEN - BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - TWILIGHT\n</b>\n               A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling \n               the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- \n               some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the \n               great man.\n\n               Godse moves forward through them toward the front just as \n               hushed voices begin to remark -- \"I see him.\" \"Here he comes!\" \n               \"Which one is Manu?\"...\n\n               Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a \n               little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people \n               watching.\n\n               Featuring Gandhi. We see him distantly through the crowd. \n               The brown, wiry figure cloaked only in loincloth and shawl, \n               still weak from his last fast and moving without his customary \n               spring and energy as he is supported by his two grand nieces, \n               his \"walking sticks,\" Manu and Abha.\n\n               We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only \n               glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes \n               with some of the crowd and the two young women who support \n               him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to \n               someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand \n               on the shoulder of each of the girls.\n\n               The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is \n               always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half \n               obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. We \n               hear the occasional click of a camera, and we intercut with \n               shots of Godse moving tensely up through the crowd, of Apte \n               and Karkare on the periphery of the crowd, watching with \n               sudden fear and apprehension, like men paralysed by the \n               presence of danger.\n\n               Featuring Godse. He slides through to the very front rank. \n               His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the \n               sides of his temples. And now, for an instant we see Gandhi \n               close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, \n               but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu \n               half obscures him.\n\n               Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he \n               moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking \n               a vessel for incense from her hands.\n\n<b>                                     MANU\n</b>                              (gently)\n                         Brother -- Bapu is already late for \n                         prayers.\n\n               Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his \n               hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.\n\n               And now we see Gandhi in full shot. The cheap glasses, the \n               nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins \n               his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting.\n\n               Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer \n               to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires \n               point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice... \n               thrice.\n\n               Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Oh, God... oh, God...\n\n               Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to\n\n<b>               KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Close shot. Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-\n               step, step of the requiem march...\n\n               Full shot. The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as \n               have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. \n               People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, \n               trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege \n               it reveals more and more... and more. All are silent. We \n               only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an \n               occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors \n               lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly \n               endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy \n               and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the \n               body of Gandhi.\n\n               And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, \n               surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief \n               and reverence.\n\n<b>               THE COMMENTATORS' ROSTRUM - KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - \n</b><b>               DAY\n</b>\n               Commentators from all over the world are covering the \n               ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most \n               distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. \n               Murrow, who sits on the makeshift platform, a microphone \n               marked \"CBS\" before him, describing the procession as \n               technicians and staff move quietly around him.\n\n<b>                                     MURROW\n</b>                              (clipped, weighted)\n                         ...The object of this massive tribute \n                         died as he had always lived -- a \n                         private man without wealth, without \n                         property, without official title or \n                         office...\n\n<b>               KINGSWAY - NEW DELHI - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the \n               marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-\n               Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, \n               blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans...\n\n<b>                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER\n</b>                         Mahatma Gandhi was not a commander \n                         of great armies nor ruler of vast \n                         lands, he could boast no scientific \n                         achievements, no artistic gift... \n                         Yet men, governments and dignitaries \n                         from all over the world have joined \n                         hands today to pay homage to this \n                         little brown man in the loincloth \n                         who led his country to freedom...\n\n               We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi \n               as it slowly inches its way along the Kingsway.\n\n               Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head \n               of dignitaries from many lands... and behind them a broad \n               mass of Indians. For a moment we see their sandalled feet \n               moving along the roadway and realize their quiet, rhythmic \n               shuffling is the only noise this vast assemblage has produced.\n\n<b>                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER\n</b>                         Pope Pius, the Archbishop of \n                         Canterbury, President Truman, Chiang \n                         Kai-shek, The Foreign Minister of \n                         Russia, the President of France... \n                         are among the millions here and abroad \n                         who have lamented his passing. In \n                         the words of General George C. \n                         Marshall, the American Secretary of \n                         State, \"Mahatma Gandhi had become \n                         the spokesman for the conscience of \n                         mankind...\"\n\n               In the crowd following the bier we pick out the tall, English \n               figure of Mirabehn, dressed in a sari, her face taut in a \n               grief that seems ready to break like the Ganges in flood. \n               Near her a tall, heavy-set man, Germanic, still powerful of \n               build and mien though his white hair and deep lines suggest \n               a man well into his sixties (Kallenbach). He too marches \n               with a kind of numb air of loss that is too personal for \n               national mourning.\n\n               On the edge of the street an American newspaperman (Walker) \n               watches as the bier passes him. He has been making notes, \n               but his hand stops now and we see the profile of Gandhi from \n               his point of view as the weapon-carrier silently rolls by. \n               It is personal, close. Walker clenches his teeth and there \n               is moisture in his eyes as he looks down. He tries to bring \n               his attention to his pad again, but his heart is not in it \n               and he stares with hollow emptiness at the street and the \n               horde of passing feet following the bier.\n\n<b>                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER\n</b>                         ...a man who made humility and simple \n                         truth more powerful than empires.\" \n                         And Albert Einstein added, \n                         \"Generations to come will scarce \n                         believe that such a one as this ever \n                         in flesh and blood walked upon this \n                         earth.\"\n\n               The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier \n               with Gandhi's body... the stout, blunt, but now shattered \n               Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face \n               of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves... and \n               finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, \n               the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a \n               loving father.\n\n<b>                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER\n</b>                         ... but perhaps to this man of peace, \n                         to this fighter who fought without \n                         malice or falsehood or hate, the \n                         tribute he would value most has come \n                         from General Douglas McArthur: \"If \n                         civilization is to survive,\" the \n                         General said this morning, \"all men \n                         cannot fail to adopt Gandhi's belief \n                         that the use of force to resolve \n                         conflict is not only wrong but \n                         contains within itself the germ of \n                         our own self-destruction.\"...\n\n               A news truck is parked in the mass of the crowd. As the \n               cortege nears, the photographers on it stand to snap their \n               pictures. There is a newsreel crew center. The camera features \n               a woman photographer (Margaret Bourke-White) who sits with \n               her legs dangling over the side of the truck, her famous \n               camera held loosely in her hand, un-regarded, as she watches \n               the body of Gandhi approach. The intelligent features are \n               betrayed by the emotion in her eyes. For an instant we see \n               Gandhi from her point of view, and read the personal impact \n               it has on her.\n\n<b>                                     MURROW'S VOICE-OVER\n</b>                         Perhaps for the rest of us, the most \n                         satisfying comment on this tragedy \n                         comes from the impudent New York PM \n                         which today wrote, \"There is still \n                         hope for a world which reacts as \n                         reverently as ours has to the death \n                         of a man like Gandhi.\"...\n\n               The camera is high and we see the cortege from the rear, \n               moving off down the vast esplanade, its narrowing path parting \n               the sea of humanity like a long trail across a weaving \n               plain... and as the shuffling sound of sandalled feet fades \n               in the distance we dissolve through to\n\n<b>               RAILROAD - SOUTH AFRICA - EXTERIOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               With the camera high we see a railroad track stretching out \n               across a darkly verdant plain, and suddenly the whistle of a \n               train as its engine and light sweep under the camera, \n               startling us as it sweeps across the moonlit landscape.\n\n               Tracking with the train. We begin at the guard's van, dwelling \n               for a moment on the words \"South African Railways,\" then \n               pass on to the dimly lit Third Class coaches in the rear of \n               the train, moving past the crowded Blacks and Indians in the \n               spare wooden accommodation... There are two or three such \n               coaches, then a Second Class coach... cushioned seats, better \n               lighting, a smattering of Europeans: farmers, clerks, young \n               families. Their clothes indicate the date: the early 1890s.\n\n               The conductor is working his way through this coach, checking \n               tickets... The track continues to the First Class coach -- \n               linen over the seats, well-lit luxurious compartments. We \n               pass a single European, and then come to rest on the back of \n               a young Indian dressed in a rather dandified Victorian attire, \n               and reading as a Black porter stows his luggage.\n\n<b>               FIRST CLASS COACH - SOUTH AFRICAN RAILWAYS - INTERIOR - \n</b><b>               NIGHT\n</b>\n               Featuring the young Indian.

He is lost in his book and there \n               is a slight smile on his face as though what he reads \n               intrigues and surprises him.

The conductor standing in the door, watching \n               Gandhi even as the train pulls out. Then the Second Class \n               coach, with people standing at the window to stare at Gandhi -- \n               then the Third Class coaches, again with Blacks and a few \n               Indians looking at Gandhi with mystification and a touch of \n               fear.\n\n               Gandhi stands with a studied air of defiance as the train \n               pulls away -- but when it is gone he is suddenly very aware \n               of his isolation and looks around the cold, dark platform \n               with self-conscious embarrassment.\n\n               A Black railway worker looks as if he would like to express \n               sympathy, but he cannot find the courage and turns away from \n               Gandhi's gaze, pulling his collar up against the piercing \n               wind.\n\n               The policeman who pulled Gandhi from the train talks with \n               the ticket-taker under the gas-lit entrance gate, both of \n               them staring off at Gandhi.\n\n               An Indian woman near the entrance sits in a woolen sari, her \n               face half-veiled. A small child sleeps in her arms, and there \n               is a tattered bundle of clothing at her feet.

I'm sure \n                         our community could keep you in work \n                         for some time, Mr. Gandhi -- even if \n                         you caused a good deal of trouble.\n                              (Gandhi reacts \n                              uncertainly.)\n                         Especially if you caused a good deal \n                         of trouble.\n\n               Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, \n               plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly \n               determined to take it.\n\n<b>               MOSQUE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               We see a rather crudely stitched sign: \"Indian Congress Party \n               of South Africa.\" Gandhi, now sporting a moustache, stands \n               with Khan and Singh near a fire that has been started in the \n               open area before the Mosque. A wire basket has been placed \n               on supports over the fire. Before them, a small crowd, mostly \n               Indian (Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims), but with a few Whites drawn \n               by curiosity. Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         There's the English reporter.

Near him, \n               trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, \n               are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables). A \n               horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them.\n\n<b>                                     KHAN\n</b>                         You also said your article would \n                         draw a thousand people.\n                              (If the crowd numbers \n                              100 they're lucky.)\n                         At least some of the Hindus brought \n                         their wives.\n\n               We see five or six women in saris standing together.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         No. I asked my wife to organize that.\n\n               We feature Gandhi's wife, Ba, standing at the front of the \n               women. She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with \n               large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this \n               moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to \n               do that which she would rather not.\n\n<b>                                     SINGH\n</b>                              (alarmed)\n                         Some of them are leaving...\n\n               Gandhi wets his lips nervously. He glances with a little \n               apprehension at the police, then takes his notes from his \n               pocket and moves to the front of the fire. He holds up his \n               hand for attention. He forces a smile -- then starts reading --\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Ladies and Gentlemen, we have asked \n                         you to gather here to help us proclaim \n                         our right to be treated as equal \n                         citizens of the Empire.\n\n               It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to \n               themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before \n               wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is \n               unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but \n               just as colorlessly.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         We do not seek conflict. We know the \n                         strength of the forces arrayed against \n                         us, know that because of them we can \n                         only use peaceful means -- but we \n                         are determined that justice will be \n                         done!\n\n               This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the \n               crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed \n               supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert \n               that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. \n               He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both \n               now. She wraps her sari more closely around her and her \n               expression is a wife's \"I told you so\" -- sufferance, \n               mortification and loyalty, all in one. Gandhi wets his lips \n               again -- and takes a square of cardboard from his pocket -- \n               his \"pass.\"\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         The symbol of our status is embodied \n                         in this pass -- which we must carry \n                         at all times, but no European even \n                         has to have.\n\n               He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         And the first step to changing our \n                         status is to eliminate this difference \n                         between us.\n\n               And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the \n               fire. The flames engulf it.\n\n               The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd \n               murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the \n               dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his \n               speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so \n               startling a gesture. Even so, a constable glances at the \n               police sergeant again, \"Do we take him?\". The sergeant just \n               shakes his head, \"Wait.\"\n\n               Khan moves up to Gandhi as the tremor of reaction ripples \n               through the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     KHAN\n</b>                              (quietly)\n                         You write brilliantly, but you have \n                         much to learn about handling men.\n\n               He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     KHAN\n</b>                              (the reading not \n                              fluent, but firm and \n                              pointed)\n                         We do not want to ignite... the fear \n                         or hatred of anyone.

He looks at the crowd. No one \n               knows quite what to do. Gandhi harumphs -- gesturing to a \n               shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather \n               lamely.\n\n<b>                                     KHAN\n</b>                         We will now burn the passes of our \n                         committee and its supporters. We ask \n                         you to put your passes on the fire \n                         with --\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         Oh, no, you bloody well don't!\n\n               He has stepped forward with his constables, who have faced \n               the crowd, halting the tentative movements of the few \n               committed supporters toward the fire.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         Those passes are government property! \n                         And I will arrest the first man who \n                         tries to burn one!\n\n               He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect \n               and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it \n               aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. \n               The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see \n               it dropped in the flame.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         Take him away!\n\n               He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and \n               marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to \n               the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant \n               takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club \n               menacingly against his hand.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         Now -- are there any more?!\n\n               Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes \n               the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Ba holds her hand \n               to her mouth -- terrified. Again the crowd's reaction turns \n               the sergeant. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes \n               lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a \n               card and drops it in the wire basket, and another.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         You little sammy bastard -- I --\n\n               He has leapt across the distance between them, knocking the \n               box from Gandhi's hands, sending the cards flying and shoving \n               Gandhi to the ground. He turns and faces the crowd angrily, \n               pointing the billy club threateningly.\n\n<b>                                     POLICE SERGEANT\n</b>                         You want that kind of trouble -- you \n                         can have it!\n\n               Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his \n               hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has \n               picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward \n               apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he \n               drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts -- \n               and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi \n               sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, \n               but the other women seize her.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         Let me go!\n\n               She fights loose, but one of the constables takes her firmly.\n\n               The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, \n               his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is \n               picking up another card. The crowd watches. The newspaper \n               reporter watches. Ba stares in anguish. Gandhi lifts the \n               card. The sergeant stares at him, angry but his emotions \n               somewhat in control after the first blow.\n\n<b>                                     SERGEANT\n</b>                         Stop!\n\n               An instant of hesitation, then Gandhi drops the card into \n               the basket. The sergeant almost stops, but he strikes again. \n               A quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as Gandhi \n               sags.\n\n               Ba's anguished face is wet with tears. The newspaper reporter \n               stares without making notes. Khan, at the paddy wagon, watches \n               in wonder.\n\n               Gandhi, his head bleeding badly now, rises to his knees -- a \n               breath and he gropes around the ground for another card. His \n               fingers finally clutch one.\n\n               The sergeant stares, his face wracked with uncertainty and \n               confusion.\n\n               Gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire, \n               then drops it in the basket.\n\n               The sergeant slams the billy club down again -- firmly, but \n               with a manifest reluctance. The crowd watches breathlessly, \n               the newspaper reporter stares.

Walker measures Gandhi with a little \n               surprise.\n\n<b>                                     WALKER\n</b>                         You're a very small minority to take \n                         on the Government -- and the Empire.\n\n               Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         If you are a minority of one, the \n                         truth is the truth.\n\n               Reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and Walker \n               senses it. But they have come by a site where a building is \n               being erected, and a European (Kallenbach) is perched above \n               a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level. \n               Some Indians are working below him. Gandhi turns to him, \n               light-hearted again.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         This is Mr. Kallenbach. He is our \n                         chief carpenter -- and also our chief \n                         benefactor. He has made this \n                         experiment possible.\n\n               Walker waves his notebook at him and Kallenbach lifts his \n               level in greeting. On his bronzed chest there is a Star of \n               David. Walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head. We \n               see two women in saris trying to quell some squabbling \n               children in the background.\n\n<b>                                     WALKER\n</b>                         Well, it's quite a place, your \n                         \"ashram\" -- is that right?\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         That's right. The word only means \n                         \"community.\" But it could stand for \n                         \"village\"... or the world.\n\n               Walker looks at him appraisingly.\n\n<b>                                     WALKER\n</b>                         You're an ambitious man.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (uncertainly)\n                         I hope not.\n\n               A moment of embarrassed doubt, then he starts toward a half-\n               finished building -- wooden sides, door, but canvas still \n               covering the roof. It has an awning spread before it. Walker's \n               carriage is tethered nearby, a Black driver standing in the \n               sun, waiting. In the background we see two women cleaning a \n               latrine. Walker glances at the latrine.\n\n<b>                                     WALKER\n</b>                         They tell me you also take your turn \n                         at peeling potatoes and cleaning the \n                         \"outhouse\" -- is that part of the \n                         experiment?\n\n               As we have approached we see a table set for tea under the \n               awning. There are two places. Having set the places, Ba is \n               walking along the side of the building, away from them. She \n               glances at Gandhi tautly and deliberately avoids speaking or \n               acknowledging him.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (a little surprised, \n                              a little annoyed)\n                         Ba -- we will need another place set \n                         for Mr. Walker's driver.\n\n               Ba looks at him coldly.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         I will tell Sora.\n\n               She turns back and walks into the building by the rear \n               entrance. Gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude, but he \n               tries to answer Walker.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         It's one way to learn that each man's \n                         labor is as important as another's. \n                         In fact when you're doing it, \n                         \"cleaning the outhouse\" seems far \n                         more important than the law.\n\n               A grin -- but forced. When a girl (Sora) comes from the \n               building bringing another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls \n               to the driver.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Please come and join us -- you'll \n                         need something before your journey \n                         back.\n                              (He nods to Walker.)\n                         Excuse me a moment.\n\n               And he goes into the building, determined to find the source \n               of Ba's aloofness.\n\n<b>               GANDHI'S HUT - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to \n               the building. She does not look up at Gandhi, but she is \n               aware of his presence. He crosses and stands in front of her \n               with all the irritation of a husband. It is hushed, aware \n               that Walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed \n               anger.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         What is it?\n\n               Now Ba looks at him hostilely.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must \n                         rake and cover the latrine.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Everyone takes his turn.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         It is the work of untouchables.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         In this place there are no \n                         untouchables -- and no work is beneath \n                         any of us!\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                              (she looks up at him)\n                         I am your wife.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         All the more reason.\n\n               He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                              (finally, scornfully)\n                         As you command.\n\n               As she starts to rise he grabs her arm, but she pulls free.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         The others may follow you -- but you \n                         forget, I knew you when you were a \n                         boy!\n\n               She says it derisively and it stings, but Gandhi is aware of \n               Walker and he fights to hold his temper.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         It's not me.

He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, \n               pulling her roughly to her feet.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         All right, go!

For a \n               moment they both stare at each other, shattered by their \n               violence.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                              (bitterly)\n                         Have you no shame?

He sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding \n               his head in his hands. Ba studies him for a moment -- and \n               she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. She moves \n               and kneels before him.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         What is the matter with me...?\n\n               A moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the \n               mother-wife she is.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                              (a beat)\n                         You are human -- only human.\n\n               Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                         And it is even harder for those of \n                         us who do not even want to be as \n                         good as you do.\n\n               And Gandhi grins weakly.

She looks \n               at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes.\n\n<b>               IMPERIAL THEATER - INTERIOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The theater is packed. The front rows near the stage are \n               held by rich Muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with \n               small traders, peddlers, artisans -- Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, \n               Sikh. The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -- \n               largely Hindu. The mood is restless, belligerent.\n\n               On the stage. Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand \n               for silence. Seated on the stage are Khan, Singh, three more \n               leaders of the Indian community. Charlie Andrews and Herman \n               Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs. Gandhi \n               looks around the audience and we see the packed house from \n               his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European \n               policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row. \n               A uniformed policeman stands near them.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (to the house)\n                         I want to welcome you all!\n\n               A buzz, then applause -- loud and defiant.

The policemen \n               just sit like stone -- confident, sure, immune to rhetoric.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Let us begin by being clear about \n                         General Smuts's new law.

The clergyman who has given Charlie the use of \n               his pulpit sits beneath it, embarrassed, but sticking \n               resolutely to his decision to give Charlie a hearing.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         But I would ask you -- assembled \n                         here in this house of God -- to \n                         recognize that we are witnessing \n                         something new, something so \n                         unexpected, so unusual that it is \n                         not surprising the Government is at \n                         a loss.

He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage \n               on his head.

The prison officer's eyes fall \n               on him.\n\n<b>               CITY STREET - JOHANNESBURG - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               A side street, but active. Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being \n               marched down the pavement before two guards. The prison \n               officer strides in front of them. People in the street stop \n               and turn, staring. That part of Gandhi that is still the \n               dandy is discomfited, but there is a growing part of him \n               that defies appearances.\n\n               Featuring a doorway. It is the side door of a large imposing \n               building. The prison officer leads his little procession \n               toward it. He knocks and the door opens. The tall civil \n               servant has been waiting for them. The prison officer reaches \n               forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles.\n\n<b>               GOVERNMENT BUILDING - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his \n               assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed \n               by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that \n               is at right angles to them (i.e. facing the front of the \n               building). People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi \n               as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison \n               garb than ever.\n\n               The grand staircase. The tall civil servant turns and starts \n               up the staircase. Gandhi is even more exposed to everyone's \n               surveillance on the wide, white expanse of the stairway. He \n               hesitates, looking around in discomfort, then follows the \n               tall civil servant on toward the large, white doors at the \n               top of the staircase.\n\n<b>               SMUTS'S ANTEROOM - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               The tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates \n               that Gandhi enter. Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and \n               the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock \n               once on the inner doors. Then he pushes them open and gestures \n               Gandhi in.\n\n<b>               SMUTS'S OFFICE - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now \n               we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts \n               makes as he stands behind the grand desk.\n\n<b>                                     SMUTS\n</b>                         Ah, Mr. Gandhi.

Then with a little sigh at the lost opportunity \n               he replaces the stopper on the sherry, turns and gestures \n               Gandhi on into the room.\n\n<b>                                     SMUTS\n</b>                         Please -- please do come and sit \n                         down.

We see one headline \n               in close shot: \"Thousands Imprisoned in South Africa/Mines \n               Close. Crops Unharvested,\" a subhead, \"Gandhi Leads Non-\n               Violent Campaign.\" He looks at Smuts. Smuts smiles, a passing \n               nod at the papers.\n\n<b>                                     SMUTS\n</b>                         Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided \n                         to ask the House to repeal the Act \n                         that you have taken such \"exception\" \n                         to.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (a beat)\n                         Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm \n                         sure it will be done.\n\n               Smuts smiles.\n\n<b>                                     SMUTS\n</b>                         Hm.

Smuts measures him again, not absolutely \n               certain how to deal with him.

A group of First \n               Class passengers, ninety percent English, look down from the \n               upper deck.\n\n               From their point of view. We see the main section of the \n               pier, a crowd of mostly European civilians on one side. A \n               mass of military on the other: European officers, topees and \n               swagger sticks, Indian cavalry, Gurkha infantry, Sikh lanoers -- \n               turbans, rifles, bugles, an Indian military band -- a showy \n               awe-inspiring display.\n\n               Featuring two Englishmen. First Class passengers, white suits, \n               Oxbridge accents; one quite young, the other a bit older, \n               both civil servants coming to \"administer\" India.\n\n<b>                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         By God, he loves it...\n\n               Their point of view. A British general is coming down the \n               gangplank accompanied by his ADC. The officer commanding and \n               the Guard of Honor await him.\n\n<b>                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         I'm sure he hates it.\n\n               The young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General \n               has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the \n               accompaniment of the military band.\n\n<b>                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         Generals' reputations are being made \n                         in France today, fighting on the \n                         Western Front. Not as Military \n                         Governors in India.\n\n               He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening \n               to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed \n               Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second \n               Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down \n               again.\n\n<b>                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         What the devil's going on back there?\n\n               He is looking aft. His point of view.\n\n               Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft \n               section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking \n               here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest \n               of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly \n               to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see \n               that person.\n\n               The young Englishman glances back at the well-dressed Indian \n               to make sure of his distance, then speaks quietly.\n\n<b>                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         It must be that Indian that made all \n                         that fuss back in Africa. My cabin \n                         boy told me he was on board.\n\n<b>                                     SECOND ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         Why haven't we seen him?\n                              (Finding the name)\n                         Gandhi?\n\n<b>                                     YOUNG ENGLISHMAN\n</b>                         Yes.

The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all \n               the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little \n               flower-covered platform.

Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's \n               shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. \n               There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we \n               hear the military band from across the way as the troops \n               prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd. \n               Finally he speaks out.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         I -- I am glad to be home.\n                              (A little round of \n                              applause.)\n                         I -- I thank you for your greeting.\n\n               He makes the pranam and starts for the steps.

They exchange a wry glance, \"Not exactly a world-\n               beater.\"\n\n               A car door slams. The camera pulls back. Nehru has slammed \n               the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down. \n               He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's \n               knapsack. An Indian chauffeur rides in front.

Some carry infants on their backs. Some small \n               children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, \n               but they are all watching the passengers of the train.\n\n               Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class \n               passengers. Ba cools her face with water. Charlie, his \n               trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a \n               skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white \n               head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes \n               have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river.\n\n               And now we see the women closely from his point of view, the \n               camera panning slowly along them. Their bodies are skin and \n               bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the \n               distance, are rags -- literally, shredded rages, one hung on \n               another. The children are hollow-eyed and gaunt, staring \n               listlessly at the train. One boy, with a stump for an arm, \n               aimlessly pushes at the flies that buzz around him.\n\n               Gandhi stands erect, lost now in the revelation of their \n               poverty. His eyes hold on one woman at the river bank. Though \n               her frail face is almost skeletal, it is beautiful but scarred \n               by a severe rash down her cheek and neck. The cloth she is \n               washing is a shredded piece of muslin. Her eyes have met \n               Gandhi's as he watches her.\n\n               Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Then he slowly moves \n               his arm out into the water and, without taking his eyes from \n               her, releases the head cloth he has been rinsing. It floats \n               along on the water down toward the woman.\n\n               She looks from Gandhi to it with sudden excitement, a sense \n               of incredulity. As the cloth nears her, she rises and moves \n               almost greedily out into the water to take it. Her hands \n               snatch at it quickly. Then she stands, looking at Gandhi. \n               The infant on her back shifts, its huge hollow eyes reacting \n               to the movement.\n\n               Gandhi smiles slowly, tilting his head just slightly to her. \n               And now that she has possession of the cloth, her manner \n               calms again. And she looks back at him, and her lips almost \n               part with a tiny smile of thanks.\n\n               Hold Gandhi, staring at her, fighting the pain in his eyes...\n\n<b>               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Threading like a lighted necklace across the darkness of a \n               vast plain.\n\n<b>               TRAIN IN HILLS - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Climbing green hills -- a totally different terrain -- and \n               again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and \n               buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; \n               farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and \n               faster... until suddenly with a hoot of the whistle and the \n               screech of brakes it stops!\n\n<b>               TRAIN - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. \n               Ahead of him other passengers are looking too; some have \n               jumped down.\n\n               Gandhi and Charlie jump down too. As they come clear they \n               can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has \n               been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry are \n               coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them.\n\n               Featuring the cavalry. They are British and their troop leader \n               is viciously angry.\n\n<b>                                     TROOP LEADER\n</b>                         Clear the way! Get out of the way!\n\n               He is swinging his sword, not lethally, but threateningly at \n               the Indian passengers from the train. His British NCOs are \n               equally angry and deliberately ride close to the passengers, \n               forcing them back against the train.\n\n               Gandhi and Charlie step back. And as the troop goes past we \n               see from their point of view a group of Indian bearers, \n               trotting in the middle of the horsemen, carrying two litters -- \n               covered, each hanging by straps from a long pole -- and each \n               bearing a badly wounded British soldier; one appears to be \n               dead.\n\n<b>               OUTSKIRTS OF VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               The shadow of a train moves slowly along the ground, a sense \n               of tension and foreboding. We hear the engine chugging slowly. \n               The camera lifts. Gandhi and Charlie stand at a window, \n               staring out grimly. Other passengers are looking off too. Ba \n               is seated, staring straight ahead, her face taut, deliberately \n               not seeing what the others are seeing.\n\n<b>               GALLOWS - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Their point of view: On a hill across from the railroad track \n               part of a prison wall is visible. In front of it a thick \n               pole is straddled across two others. From this crude gallows \n               two Indian men hang by the neck. One is in turban and dhoti, \n               the other in a tunic. The sound of the train stopping.\n\n<b>               VILLAGE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Close shot. Incense rising in shot. The camera pulls back \n               and back. The incense is burning in a bowl sitting before \n               Gandhi on a make-shift platform set in the little valley \n               between the train line and the little hill where the Indian \n               men have been hanged. A small crowd sits in a crescent before \n               him, Ba and Charlie are bent in prayer on the platform behind \n               him. When the camera comes to rest, the edge of the gallows \n               and a portion of one of the hanged men is in the frame. We \n               know we are looking from someone's point of view near the \n               prison wall.\n\n               Finally, Gandhi lifts his head.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (at first distant, as \n                              from the hill)\n                         I ask you to pray for those who died.\n                              (Closer)\n                         For the English soldiers...\n                              (a murmur)\n                         who were doing what they thought was \n                         right.\n                              (Closer)\n                         And for the brave terrorists whose \n                         patriotism led them to do what was \n                         wrong.\n\n               The murmur of resistance from the crowd is louder at this. \n               Gandhi shakes his head at the dissent.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         It is not my law, it is the law of \n                         creation.

Newspaper cameramen crowded \n               around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from \n               the back of the platform, clapping. He is chairing the \n               Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the \n               auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the \n               spotlight.\n\n               At last he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru \n               clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. \n               And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- \n               again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end \n               of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the \n               flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah.\n\n               Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the \n               house with upraised hands.\n\n<b>                                     PATEL\n</b>                         And let no one question that Mr. \n                         Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims -- \n                         but for all India!\n\n               And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. \n               He raises his hands, stilling them again.\n\n<b>                                     PATEL\n</b>                         And now I'm going to introduce to \n                         you a man whose writings we are all \n                         becoming familiar with... a man who \n                         stood high in the esteem of our \n                         beloved Professor Gokhale... a man \n                         whose accomplishment in South Africa \n                         will always be remembered.

As Gandhi reaches the podium, \n               Patel gestures him to it.\n\n<b>                                     PATEL\n</b>                              (politely)\n                         Your journal has made a great impact.\n\n               Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         I am flattered by Mr. Patel\n                              (His grin.)\n                         I would be even more flattered if \n                         what he said were true.\n\n               He means about the journal.\n\n               Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already \n               on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- \n               a smile, a politician's flexibility --\n\n<b>                                     PATEL\n</b>                              (loudly; he is away \n                              from the mike)\n                         But it's true!

He has one slip of \n               paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium.

Ba and an ashramite \n               woman squat by the river, washing clothes. It is long past \n               the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed \n               to the water.

He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts \n               the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying \n               desperately not to show it.\n\n               Close shot.

An open staff car pulls up through the \n               press of the crowd. An English captain leaps out and pushes \n               aggressively through the mass of bodies toward the platform. \n               Again the darkness of the ill-lit station and the angle of \n               the camera limit our vision.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                         Clear the way there!

The whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered \n               thick with waiting crowds. They engulf the station house, \n               back and front, and on the other side of the train more people \n               are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the \n               narrow street that stretches through the little collection \n               of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered -- \n               men, women with babes in arms, children. There is no \n               excitement, hardly any movement -- just a vast congregation \n               of people, waiting silently is the darkness -- and as the \n               camera pans we see that the crowd extends, indiscernible, \n               even beyond the range of light.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                              (awed, a little \n                              frightened)\n                         What the hell is going on?\n\n<b>                                     SERGEANT PUTNAM\n</b>                         I don't know, sir.

He has stepped down from the train. Shukla \n               guides him, Ba and Charlie a step or two behind. Gandhi moves \n               through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a \n               little to either side. As he advances, the crowd parts -- it \n               is almost eerily silent. As their clothes indicate, the area \n               is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the \n               forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi \n               as he moves through them. Most of the faces are gaunt and \n               lean. A destitute people.\n\n               And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on \n               the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his \n               way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that \n               was being made for him. The sergeant and part of the detail \n               and behind the captain.\n\n               The captain stares. Then he looks around at the crowd, \n               suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                         Who the devil are you?\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         My name is Gandhi.

Another glance at the crowd, \n               this time with an air of outraged authority.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                         Well, whoever you are, we don't want \n                         you here.

He glances at Charlie who stands behind \n               Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                         I don't want any trouble.\n\n               He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         I am an Indian traveling in my own \n                         country.

He glances at Charlie again.\n\n<b>                                     ENGLISH CAPTAIN\n</b>                         Well, there'd better not be.\n\n               Again, the empty severity of weakness. He looks around, then \n               turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the \n               crowd. \"Out of my way, there! Come on, move!\"\n\n               Gandhi smiles reflectively, and the crowd suddenly begins to \n               buzz. Where all was silence before there is now the hum of \n               excitement. Already he has scored a victory -- and as he \n               moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with \n               flushed greetings. \"Gandhi -- Gandhi -- Bapu -- Gandhiji\"...\n\n<b>               PEASANT'S DWELLING - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling. We feature \n               a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha). \n               He lies on a straw mat.\n\n<b>                                     MEHA\n</b>                         For years the landlords have ordered \n                         us to grow indigo, for dyeing the \n                         cloth. Always they took part of the \n                         crop as rent.\n\n               Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening. It is the kind of \n               listening that opens the heart. Behind him a mass of villagers \n               sits stoically, outside the dwelling, waiting while their \n               case is heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally but under \n               Gandhi's sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking through.\n\n<b>                                     MEHA\n</b>                         But now the English factories make \n                         cloth for everyone. No one wants our \n                         indigo. And the landlords won't take \n                         their share. They say we must pay \n                         our rent in cash.\n\n               Near to breakdown, he gestures around the empty house.\n\n<b>                                     MEHA\n</b>                         What we could, we sold... The police \n                         have taken the rest.

Meha nods.\n\n               Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, almost nothing \n               remains. We see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the \n               other older, and a girl, sixteen. And finally Meha's wife, \n               sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's \n               wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead \n               and hardly combed, her sari dirty.\n\n               Meha looks at Gandhi and shakes his head hopelessly. Gandhi \n               nods... He stands slowly.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         What we can do... we will try to do.\n\n               The words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes. He \n               glances at Meha's wife. Water comes to her eyes, and she \n               lowers her head. Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps \n               her to her, and the woman breaks, and sobs and sobs...\n\n<b>               TILLED FIELD - CHAMPARAN - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant, his mind locked \n               in sober reflection.

Ba \n               and Charlie are mounted on a similar howdah on another \n               elephant, both being led by peasant boys. Charlie is pointing \n               behind them. Coming along the path is a tall Indian policeman \n               on a bicycle. He rides right past Charlie and Ba and comes \n               alongside Gandhi.

Gandhi\" \n               coming from the mobs outside the courtroom that fills the \n               atmosphere with threat.\n\n               The magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom; he \n               signals his clerk (English) to him.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                              (whispered conference)\n                         I am going to clear the courtroom.\n\n<b>                                     CLERK\n</b>                              (politely)\n                         I'm not sure we'd be able to.

He \n               indicates that the clerk take his place.\n\n               Gandhi stands. The courtroom is silent, but we can still \n               hear the sound of the chanting outside.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         You have been ordered out of the \n                         province on the grounds of disturbing \n                         the peace.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (defiantly)\n                         With respect, I refuse to go.\n\n               The magistrate stares. The journalists write. The clerk \n               swallows.\n\n               The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too \n               aware of the mob outside.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                              (sternly)\n                         Do you want to go to jail?\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                              (not giving him an \n                              inch)\n                         As you wish.\n\n               The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches \n               the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands \n               for an answer. Finally\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                              (as much sternness as \n                              he can muster)\n                         All right.

In the chaos of cheering and \n               delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and \n               heads for his chambers.\n\n               The journalists are scribbling furiously.\n\n               Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom. We hear cries \n               of \"Gandhi! -- Gandhi! -- Bapu!\"\n\n<b>               THE COURTHOUSE BALCONY\n</b>\n               Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony.

Footsteps pace its acres of space... and Sir \n               George Hodge comes into frame.

His desk is arrayed with several \n               tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same covers -- \n               and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers. We \n               can just read \"Gandhi\" in a headline.

Princes, maharajahs, \n               generals, ranking British civil servants and their ladies \n               taking tea on the manicured lawns among the exotic flowers. \n               But over all there is a thread of anxiety, we pick up one or \n               two nervous phrases: \"At the West Gate there were no taxis \n               at all!,\" \"Of course, the Army will always be loyal.\" And \n               the camera picks out a civil servant stepping from a door of \n               the palace carrying a sheaf of telegrams and cable forms.\n\n               He searches the assembled guests, then heads with almost \n               indecorous haste toward his target. It is the Viceroy, Lord \n               Chelmsford. With him, talking quietly, are his aide-de-camp, \n               the Governor of the province and his ADC, and the commanding \n               general of the Army in India. Lord Chelmsford's ADC is the \n               first to react to the civil servant's arrival and his \n               impatient attendance.\n\n<b>                                     ADC\n</b>                         Sir -- it's Mr. Kinnoch.\n\n               Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly.\n\n<b>                                     CHELMSFORD\n</b>                         Yes?\n\n<b>                                     KINNOCH\n</b>                              (hesitant, stunned)\n                         Nothing... nothing is working, sir -- \n                         buses... trains... the markets...\n                              (Personal, incredulous)\n                         There's not even any civilian staff \n                         here, sir...

The camera pulls back \n               from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees and then \n               suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, \n               cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. \n               He is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the \n               head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis -- \n               immaculate, precise, awesome. Behind them a staff car with \n               Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer.

A large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform \n               at one side of the park. It is political, but the crowd is \n               mixed. We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old \n               men, little children, women with babes in arms. Some donkey \n               carts, a sense of fair-time gaiety.\n\n               We close in on the speaker -- a Muslim.

Dyer looks ahead calmly.\n\n               His point of view. The Gate of the Bagh. A rickety double \n               gate in the high crumbling wall. On each pillar, poster \n               notices for the meeting: \"For Congress -- For Gandhi.\" In \n               the distance the speaker and the assembled crowd. Nearer, a \n               few vendors, loiterers and children. At the sound of the \n               armored car and marching feet, a few turn in curiosity.\n\n               Another angle. The armored car grinds forward. It won't go \n               through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post. \n               Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away. Dyer jumps \n               down lightly -- a man in splendid condition. He walks through \n               the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands \n               clasping his swagger stick behind his back. looking off at \n               The speaker -- medium shot.\n\n<b>                                     SPEAKER\n</b>                         ...If we riot, if we fight back, we \n                         become the vandals and they become \n                         the law!

And finally the camera comes to \n               a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have \n               just left.

The camera \n               continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the dried \n               blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled \n               ground around it, little pieces of clothing. Flies buzz around \n               the debris. Abstractedly, Gandhi touches the bucket rope \n               that lies across the surround.

Across \n               from them is the \"Indian\" side: Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Jinnah, \n               Azad.

We are featuring two \n               British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering \n               torch light that reveals their tense wariness.\n\n               Another angle. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is \n               gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- \n               and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant \n               roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits \n               cross-legged on the platform. Nehru is with him. Patel, now \n               for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an \n               Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with \n               them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who \n               has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd.\n\n<b>                                     BA\n</b>                              (simple, direct)\n                         ...but now something worse is \n                         happening. When Gandhiji and I were \n                         growing up, women wove their own \n                         cloth. But now there are millions \n                         who have no work because those who \n                         can buy all they need from England. \n                         I say with Gandhiji, there is no \n                         beauty in the finest cloth if it \n                         makes hunger and unhappiness.\n\n               It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and \n               turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not \n               acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, \n               who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and \n               the noise and applause increase to something like chaos.\n\n               In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the \n               perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary \n               by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his \n               glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd \n               and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but \n               quite definitely, the crowd stills.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         My message tonight is the message I \n                         have given to your brothers \n                         everywhere. To gain independence we \n                         must prove worthy of it.\n\n               We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly.

Now Gandhi raises a third finger.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Third -- we must defy the British.\n\n               And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets \n               it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture \n               as before.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         Not with violence that will inflame \n                         their will, but with firmness that \n                         will open their eyes.\n\n               This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out \n               across them as though seeking something.

Some of the marchers wave their cloth \n               tauntingly at the police. One policeman suddenly steps out \n               and grabs at a piece of cloth waved at him.

A corner of the building engulfed in flames. The camera \n               pulls back and we see the whole building swept with fire. \n               The heat of it keeps the crowd back but they are still \n               shouting \"Out -- Out! -- Out\" -- and a sudden cheer.\n\n               At the door of the flaming building. One policeman appears, \n               his face blackened with soot, his hands up over his head. \n               Another appears in the smoke behind him, and they start to \n               come out -- not only the original six but the five or six \n               others who were in the building -- rushing suddenly from the \n               heat of the fire.\n\n               Close shot -- the crowd.

The crowd massed around the fallen figure, a \n               flash of the sword going up over the heads -- a breathless \n               pause -- and it comes down again... savagely.\n\n               Later. The flames of the crumbled building. The crowd has \n               gone and we only hear the roar of the flames. The camera \n               pans across the flames, and we see a skull, charred flesh \n               still clinging to it, the eyes black holes, the teeth bare \n               as it burns in the fire.\n\n<b>               JINNAH'S DRAWING ROOM - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Close shot -- Gandhi.

A moment of silence and then we begin to \n               hear the tick of a clock, the sounds of others moving in the \n               room, and finally\n\n<b>                                     PATEL'S VOICE\n</b>                         That's one bit of news they haven't \n                         censored.\n\n               Another angle.

A doctor in a white tunic \n               sits on the porch, reading. On a small table beside him we a \n               stethoscope and the equipment to measure blood pressure.

She is not yet devotee and nurse. \n               She removes her sandals and walks across the room.\n\n               Ba looks up at her.

As \n               Gandhi looks at MacDonald, we read on his face his perception \n               of the sad truth.\n\n               E.

Everybody including Walker and \n               Mirabehn are nodding \"Yes.\" Gandhi shrugs, grins at everyone's \n               excitement, and begins.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         I am glad to speak to America where \n                         so many friends exist that I know \n                         only in my heart.\n\n               As the speech continues in the thin, static-y tones of \n               thirties' radio, we see Mirabehn and the technicians listening \n               in the control room./ Walker, across the table from Gandhi./ \n               The outside of Broadcasting House./ The Empire State Building \n               and Manhattan./ A mid-western farmhouse./ A thirties' radio \n               set in a thirties' American living room./ A family, listening, \n               kids playing on the floor, half ignoring it, the mother \n               ironing, the father in an armchair, a newspaper open.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI'S VOICE\n</b>                              (continuing over all)\n                         I think your interest and the world's \n                         has fallen on India, not only because \n                         we are struggling for freedom, but \n                         because the way we are doing so is \n                         unique as far as history shows us. \n                         Here in Europe mighty nations are, \n                         it seems, already contemplating \n                         another war, though I think they, \n                         and all the world, are sick to death \n                         of bloodspilling. All of us are \n                         seeking a way out, and I flatter \n                         myself that perhaps the ancient land \n                         of India will offer such a way. If \n                         we are to make progress we must not \n                         repeat history, but make history. \n                         And I myself will die before I betray \n                         our belief that love is a stronger \n                         weapon than hate.\n\n               H.

Gandhi \n               hesitates, and then he sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap. \n               He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go.\n\n               Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell \n               and stands.\n\n               The doorway. Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him \n               and do down the corridor with Azad. He looks back.\n\n               His point of view. Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his \n               eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare.\n\n               Another angle -- later. The light has changed. A fly moves \n               along a small section of the floor that still contains a \n               ribbon of the dying sunlight.\n\n               Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into \n               nothingness.\n\n               The doctor appears in the doorway. He pauses, nods amiably \n               to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at \n               all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba \n               and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds \n               it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden \n               fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers \n               her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears. \n               He puts the acoustic bell over her heart... a moment, and he \n               lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we \n               already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, \n               who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly \n               to Gandhi.\n\n               Gandhi. His point of view. His posture is utterly unchanged, \n               Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily \n               at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to \n               run down his cheeks. He does not move, there is no change in \n               his empty stare, but the tears continue to flow.\n\n<b>               SMALL COURTYARD OF THE PALACE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done.\n\n               Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal, stand with other prisoners \n               and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead -- \n               and the living, for Gandhi sits a little distance from the \n               pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in \n               tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never \n               move again.\n\n               Close shot -- Mirabehn watching him her face wet with tears.\n\n<b>               DELHI AIRPORT - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Extreme close shot.

And \n               slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is \n               part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft.\n\n               We cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before \n               a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door.\n\n               An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music.

It is a break in their Independence Conference, and \n               as he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with \n               Azad.

Many wave black flags. \n               A couple of trucks that have brought them, and a car, are \n               along the path. Kallenbach is stepping out of an old 1942 \n               open Austin that he has put in a waiting position near the \n               entrance to the path.

Nehru has stepped out onto the \n               porch and he glares at the youths.

As they get into the car, we see the car that \n               sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths.

His vanity is too great not \n               to be touched by that prospect.

A surging gang of youths, many carrying \n               torches, and far outnumbering the little group of police and \n               soldiers, are shouting up at the roof. We see three or four \n               black flags and stains of blood on many of them.

It is a comment too grave for glibness, \n               and Gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it.

He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he \n               finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire \n               and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his \n               jaw occasionally in pain.

We hear \n               him bellow, \"Stand down.\" The constable hangs up and sighs \n               heavily.

He is curled almost in the \n               fetal position, his face looking wan and sunken. For the \n               first time there is silence, no explosions, no distant shouts, \n               no gunfire.\n\n<b>                                     MIRABEHN\n</b>                         Bapu, there's been no fighting -- \n                         anywhere.

Nearer Gandhi, behind \n               Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad and Pyarelal.\n\n               Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her \n               eyes.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         It is foolish if it is just to save \n                         the life of an old man.\n\n<b>                                     MIRABEHN\n</b>                         No... no.

Nehru bends to Gandhi. Gandhi holds his hand out to \n               him, and Nehru clutches it. Then\n\n<b>                                     NEHRU\n</b>                         You see, Bapu, it is not difficult. \n                         I have fasted only a few hours and I \n                         accomplished what you could not do \n                         in as many days.\n\n               It is a joke in their way with each other and Gandhi's eyes \n               light, his smile comes. But it is tired. He puts his other \n               hand over Nehru's and Nehru lowers his head to it, crying \n               silently.\n\n<b>               BIRLA HOUSE - EXTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               As in the opening sequence -- but a few minutes earlier. The \n               crowd is beginning to gather for the evening prayers. We see \n               a tonga or two, a gardener opening the gate to the garden, \n               three policemen standing, talking idly among themselves.\n\n<b>               BIRLA HOUSE - INTERIOR - DAY\n</b>\n               Laughter. Gandhi is eating muli; he holds his head back to \n               capture the lemon juice. We hear the click of a camera\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI\n</b>                         That is how you eat muli.\n\n               Manu hands him a cloth and he wipes his hands.

We get a wide-angle shot now \n               and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite \n               subjects again. She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, \n               who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, \n               who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor. Pyarelal is \n               working on papers with him but grins at this.\n\n<b>                                     BOURKE-WHITE\n</b>                         Don't worry, with luck you may not \n                         be.\n\n               And she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to Manu. \n               Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of \n               pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's.\n\n<b>                                     PATEL\n</b>                         No, he'll be remembered for tempting \n                         fate.\n\n               It is wry, but waspishly chiding. Abha suddenly holds a \n               picture up for Gandhi to see.

He swallows, restraining his own emotion, \n               and slowly, ritualistically, sprinkles the ashes over the \n               water.\n\n               And as they spread, we hold on that stretch of the river, \n               the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark, timeless \n               current moves them toward the sea.\n\n<b>                                     GANDHI'S VOICE\n</b>                              (weak, struggling, as \n                              he spoke the words \n                              to Mirabehn)\n                         ...There have been tyrants and \n                         murderers -- and for a time they can \n                         seem invincible. But in the end they \n                         always fall. Think of it -- always... \n                         When you are in doubt that that is \n                         God's way, the way the world is meant \n                         to be... think of that.\n\n               And slowly the camera begins pulling back, leaving the \n               flowers, the brown, rolling current as though leaving the \n               story of Gandhi, going far out, away from the great river, \n               reaching higher and higher, through streaks of clouds as end \n               titles begin.\n\n               And through them, once more we hear, dimly, reminiscently, \n               through the rushing wind:\n\n               \"At home children are writing 'essays' about him!\"... the \n               croaky voice singing, \"God save our gracious King\"...
