SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY\n\n     Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars\n     motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls\n     of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.\n\n     ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,\n     past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,\n     Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of\n     this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-\n     HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look\n     at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see\n     they're leaving a 99-cent store.\n\n     As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are\n     connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.\n     Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.\n\n     They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men\n     pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful\n     woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes\n     rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.\n\n     - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the\n     tops of her thighs.\n\n     - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a\n     MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.\n\n     - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the\n     TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.\n\n     It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block\n     that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is\n     so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All\n     those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have\n     obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.\n\n     EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY\n\n     A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING\n     TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Fuck.\n\n     Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to\n     her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.\n\n     As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses\n     accidentally CLATTER to the ground.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Shit.\n\n     When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.\n\n                               ERIN\n            God damn it.\n\n     She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.\n\n     WIDER ON THE STREET\n\n     The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls\n     slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the\n     corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side\n     of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It\n     SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.\n\n     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY\n\n     A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded\n     by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.\n\n                               ROSALIND (O.S.)\n            Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY\n\n     Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over\n     the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.\n\n     ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper\n     receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his\n     mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --\n     already rumpled.\n\n                               ED\n            Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.\n\n     Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that\n     is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off\n     toward his office.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what\n     can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.\n     She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Tony Marvin.\n\n                               ED\n            Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain\n            and suffering this time?\n\n                               BRENDA\n            His dry cleaners.  You want him?\n\n                               ED\n            What do you think?  What's this?\n\n     He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.\n\n                               ED\n            Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's\n            your nine o'clock in there.\n\n     Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,\n     unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,\n     in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a\n     spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.\n     Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.\n\n                               ED\n            Whoa.\n                        (to Brenda)\n            Remind me.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her\n            fault, she says.\n                        (sarcastic)\n            And she looks like such an honest girl, don't\n            you think?\n\n                               ED\n            You shouldn't judge, Brenda.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.\n\n     As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call\n            you back.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery\n     entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.\n\n                               ED\n            Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,\n            sit down, sit down.\n\n     He clears a stack of papers off a chair.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Thanks a lot.\n                        (as she sits)\n            I tell you, I never thought just standing\n            would take it out of me, but ever since that\n            shithead hit me, it feels like my whole\n            body's put together wrong.\n\n     Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.\n\n                               ED\n            Jesus, you poor thing.\n                        (he sits)\n            Well, listen, you came to the right place.\n            Whoever did this to you made one hell of a\n            mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make\n            him pay for it.\n\n     He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.\n\n                               ED\n            Why don't you tell me what happened?\n\n                                                  DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY\n\n     Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she\n     owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to\n     Ed, who's questioning her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I was pulling out real slow, and out of\n            nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the\n            corner like a bat outta hell ...\n\n     She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits\n     nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS\n     are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.\n\n     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:\n\n                               ERIN\n            They took some bone from my hip and put it\n            in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm\n            about seventeen thousand in debt right now.\n\n     STILL LATER:\n\n                               ERIN\n            ... couldn't take painkillers cause they\n            made me too groggy to take care of my kids.\n\n     STILL LATER:\n\n                               ERIN\n            ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's\n            just nine months.\n\n     STILL LATER:\n\n                               ERIN\n            ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,\n            a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care\n            of my kids.  You know?\n\n                               ED\n                        (oh so moved)\n            Yeah.  I know.\n\n     INT. COURTROOM - LATER\n\n     Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is\n     questioning her.\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n            Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your\n            ex-husband helping out?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Which one?\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n                        (feigning shock)\n            There's more than one?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah.  There's two.  Why?\n\n     Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of\n     conservative family values.  Oh, shit.\n\n     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (getting defensive)\n            ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.\n            But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't\n            have this neck thing.\n\n     Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.\n     Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n                        (sarcastic)\n            Right.  No doubt.\n\n     Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.\n\n     STILL LATER:\n\n     The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting\n     to feel the case slipping away.\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n            So.  You must've been feeling pretty\n            desperate that afternoon.\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (pointed)\n            What's your point?\n\n     Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n            Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a\n            Jaguar must've looked like a pretty good\n            meal ticket.\n\n     Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.\n     She's on a sinking ship.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What?  Hey -- he hit me.\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n            So you say.\n\n                               ERIN\n            He came tearing around the corner, out of\n            control --\n\n                               DEFENDING LAWYER\n            An ER doctor who spends his days saving\n            lives was the one out of control --\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (erupting)\n            That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!\n\n     INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,\n     furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Open and shut?  Open and fucking shut?\n\n                               ED\n            If you hadn't used profanity --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God\n            damn, he made me look like some cheap --\n\n                               ED\n            I told you the questions might get a little\n            personal --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a\n            million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.\n\n     Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.\n\n                               ED\n            Okay -- let's try and settle down here.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Settle down?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.\n            Masry!  I can't afford to settle down!\n\n     Beat.\n\n                               ED\n            I'm sorry, Erin.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my\n            kids.\n\n     Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The\n     Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.\n\n     Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads\n     over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.\n\n     A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white\n     baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.\n\n                               MRS. MORALES\n            Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?\n\n     She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.\n     Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where\n            are Matt and Katie?\n\n                               MRS. MORALES\n            Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?\n\n     The truth is too depressing to share.\n\n                               ERIN\n            It'll be fine, yeah.\n\n                               MRS. MORALES\n            Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell\n            you before, with your worries --\n\n                               ERIN\n            What?\n\n                               MRS. MORALES\n            My daughter, she's bought a big house with a\n            room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You're moving away?  When?\n\n                               MRS.

MORALES\n            I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can\n            help my daughter take care of my grandkids.\n            And it's good for you, too.  Now you have\n            money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?\n            Not the old lady next door.\n\n     Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,\n     she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Ugh.\n\n     Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging\n     her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY\n\n     Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of\n     beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are\n     at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac\n     & Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            I don't like this part, it's all crusty.\n\n                               KATIE\n            I like the crust.\n\n     Erin switches the plates.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.\n\n                               KATIE\n            How come you're not eating?\n\n     Cause there isn't enough food.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Mamma's gonna eat later.\n\n     From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.\n     Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?\n\n     INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with\n     STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,\n     trying to steam the illness out of her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.\n\n     But her face doesn't look like she believes it.\n\n     EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY\n\n     Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.\n\n     INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY\n\n     Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the\n     medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,\n     glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.\n\n     INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY\n\n     As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up\n     with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought\n            a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?\n\n                               CHECK-OUT LADY\n            Honey, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky\n            if I even see a face, much less remember it.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.\n            Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here\n            some medicine, and by the time I got home, I\n            realized I'd bought the adult stuff by\n            mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I\n            can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --\n            could I maybe exchange it anyway ...\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Just remember.  No matter what your Mamma\n            does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I\n            don't ever wanna hear you doing something\n            like that ...\n\n     On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row\n     of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG\n     crawls across the edge of the paper.\n\n                               ERIN\n            ...

As he\n     heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee\n     sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.\n\n                               ED\n            Damn it!\n                        (calling out)\n            Brenda!\n\n     She pops her head in.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Yeah?\n\n     He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.\n\n                               ED\n            What the hell is this doing here?\n\n                               BRENDA\n            It's those files you asked for.\n\n                               ED\n            I didn't mean for you to leave them in the\n            middle of the floor.

Mario heads away from her.\n\n                               ED\n            What's she doing here?\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Who?\n\n     Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.\n\n                               ED\n            Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?\n\n                               MARIO\n            She works here.\n\n     Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\n     The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all\n     stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.\n\n                               ED\n            Erin!  How's it going?\n\n     Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You never called me back.  I left messages.\n\n                               ED\n            You did?  Wow, sorry about that.\n                        (beat)\n            Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He\n            seems to think that you said --\n\n                               ERIN\n            There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.\n            Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did\n            both.\n\n     Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of\n     this.  Ed lowers his voice.\n\n                               ED\n            I never lied.  I may have miscalculated --\n            that happens sometimes, but --\n\n                               ERIN\n            You said things would be fine, and they're\n            not.\n\n                               ED\n            I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --\n\n                               ERIN\n            I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And\n            I've looked, but when you've spent the last\n            six years raising babies, it's real hard to\n            convince someone to give you a job that pays\n            worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the\n            one who said I was gonna be okay, you should\n            be the one to hire me.\n\n     Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.\n\n                               ED\n            I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I\n            have a full staff right now, so --\n\n     He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Bullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd\n            have time to return your damn phone calls.\n\n     She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.\n\n                               ED\n            Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for\n            a job here, you can do it the way everyone\n            else does.  Send in a r\u00c8sum\u00c8, make an --\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm\n            someone you made promises to that you didn't\n            deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'\n            well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-\n            working, and I'll do anything.  But if you\n            think I'm leaving here without a job, you\n            got another thing coming.\n\n     Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.\n     He looks back at Erin.\n\n                               ED\n            No benefits.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY\n\n     A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.

That way, at any time, we\n            can find out a case's status -- where it is\n            in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em\n            all here, alphabetically --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, hell.\n                        (beat)\n            I'm dyslexic.\n\n                               ANNA\n            That's a joke, right?\n\n     Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\n     As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the\n     bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.\n\n                               JANE\n            Just last week, he told my sister we weren't\n            hiring.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            What's your sister look like?\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n     Ed is packing up his office.

Just -- for the weekend.\n\n                               ED\n            Jane's the office manager.  She handles\n            payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early\n            on Fridays.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.\n\n     Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.\n\n                               ED\n            Oh, for Christ's sake ...\n\n     He takes out his wallet, looks in.\n\n                               ED\n            All I have is hundreds.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.\n\n                               ED\n            Bullshit, you don't.\n\n     He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,\n     she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a\n     great big kiss.\n\n     EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a\n     shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt\n     pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.\n\n     EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT\n\n     Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag\n     of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying\n     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving\n     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a\n     flower display outside the store.\n\n                               KATIE\n            Mommy, can I get a flower?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF\n     DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.\n     Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,\n     smiles, then kisses them good-night.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.\n     But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled\n     with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.\n     It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what\n     used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are\n     parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the\n     stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hey!\n\n     But of course he can't hear her.

Everything about GEORGE\n     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long\n     hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Well, hello to you, darlin'.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What the hell do you think you're doing,\n            making all that Goddamn noise?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Just introducing myself to the neighbors.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're\n            introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.\n\n     The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to\n     her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a\n            beautiful woman next door, I'da done this\n            different.

Tell you what.\n            How about if I take you out on a date to\n            apologize for my rudeness?\n\n     Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you\n            up proper and ask you out and everything.\n\n     She stops at her porch, turns to him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You want my number?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I do.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Which number do you want, George?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            You got more than one?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Shit, yeah.

Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five.\n            That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven\n            is my son's age.  Two is how many times I\n            been married and divorced.  You getting all\n            this?  16 is the number of dollars in my\n            bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number.\n            And with all the other numbers I gave you,\n            I'm guessing zero is the number of times\n            you're gonna call it.\n\n     She turns and heads inside.  He calls out after her:\n\n                               GEORGE\n            How the hell do you know your bank balance\n            right off the top of your head like that?\n            See, that impresses me.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n\n     Morning.  Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb.  She passes\n     the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.\n     Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge.  They both check out her\n     short hem.  Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well.  Erin\n     glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at\n     her judgementally.

I like how they keep it all simple,\n            you know?  They don't get all complicated\n            about life, like grown-ups do.

ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress\n     on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all\n     over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE LETTER\n\n     It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the\n     phrases, \"purchase your house ...\", \"fair market value ...\"\n\n     CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT\n\n     It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner,\n     cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range.\n\n     From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still\n     reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets.\n\n     INT.

The first\n     paragraph contains the phrase \"... medical examination of\n     Donna and Peter Irving ...\"\n\n     Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is\n     headed: \"IN RANGE\".  The other: \"OUT OF RANGE\".  Under that\n     head appear the following: \"lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,\n     natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells\".\n\n     Erin stares at it, confused.\n\n     INT.

Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.\n\n                               DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)\n            Hi!  You've reached the Irvings.  Leave a\n            message and we'll get back to you just as\n            soon as we can.  Bye-bye.\n\n     BEEP.  Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the\n     file.  Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in\n     Hinkley, California.\n\n     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY\n\n     The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.  DISCO MUSIC\n     blares from its speakers.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY\n\n     This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no\n     community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with\n     small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the\n     landscape like occasional tombstones.\n\n     A beat-up old sign on the road reads: \"HINKLEY, CA.  POP: \"\n     but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.\n\n     As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto\n     Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY\n\n     Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.\n     A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.\n\n     As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she\n     drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray\n     structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from\n     the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.\n\n     She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has\n     been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing\n     -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.\n\n     EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of\n     nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence\n     hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A\n     few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.\n\n     The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets\n     out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into\n     the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.\n\n     DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a\n     scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and\n     her dark curls are piled on top of her head.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hi.  Donna Irving?\n\n                               DONNA\n            Yes?\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?\n\n                               DONNA\n                        (a little surprised)\n            You're a lawyer?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for\n            them.  You got a minute?\n\n     INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.\n     Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.\n     Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.\n\n                               ERIN\n            This is a real nice place you got here.\n\n                               DONNA (O.S.)\n            Well it oughta be, with all the work I put\n            into it.\n\n     She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.\n\n                               DONNA\n            I added air conditioning, put in the pool,\n            made all those pillows by hand ...\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that.\n            They make the place feel real homey.\n\n     Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm\n            being such a stickler on this house price\n            thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's\n            backside, especially after all they've done\n            for Hinkley, but I look around here and I\n            think, if they want this place, they're\n            gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just\n            mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay\n            me for the trouble of starting over.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Right.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Cause first you gotta move, then there's\n            decorating, and if the windows aren't the\n            same size, you know -- you're making all new\n            curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I\n            have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.\n            Me and Peter both have.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I\n            was going through your file here, and I ran\n            into these medical records.  They kinda\n            surprised me --\n\n     This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-\n     pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of\n     lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.\n\n                               DONNA\n            I know.  They're more than a bit unusual.\n            See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's\n            disease.  That's a kind of cancer --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the\n            Lord, but you never know.  And then while\n            that's going on, I end up having to have a\n            hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps\n            removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,\n            but still, no matter how positive you stay,\n            an operation can still take it out of you.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'll say.  Holy moley.\n\n                               DONNA\n            So the whole idea of selling the house --\n            don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to\n            some better place, but if they aren't gonna\n            pay us properly, I just don't see the point.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah, I can see that.\n                        (beat)\n            I guess the only thing that confused me is -\n            - not that your medical problems aren't\n            important, but -- how come the files about\n            them are in with all the real estate stuff?\n\n     Donna tops off their iced teas.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if\n            I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I\n            just kept all PG&E correspondence in one\n            place.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you\n            were corresponding with PG&E about it in the\n            first place.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.\n\n                               ERIN\n            They did?\n\n                               DONNA\n            You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole\n            family.  And not like with insurance where\n            you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,\n            either.  They just took care of it.  Just\n            like that.  We never even saw a bill.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Wow.  Why would they do that?\n\n                               DONNA\n            Cause of the chromium.\n\n                               ERIN\n            The what?\n\n                               DONNA\n            The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this\n            whole thing off.\n\n     INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY\n\n     CLOSE ON A BOX, with \"CHROM INFO\" scrawled on it.\n\n                               DONNA (O.S.)\n            PG&E came around a few years ago, told us\n            they put chromium in our well by mistake.\n            And since we shouldn't have to drink it if\n            we don't want to, they gave us free spring\n            water and offered to buy our house.\n\n     WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What's chromium?\n\n                               DONNA\n            It's a chemical they used over at that\n            compressor station up the road there.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have\n            been so sick --\n\n                               DONNA\n            I thought the same thing, right off the bat.\n            That's why we went to see the doctor.  But\n            hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do\n            with the other.\n\n     She rifles through the box.\n\n                               DONNA\n            This is the info they gave us.  You'll see\n            if you look through it, chromium's good for\n            you.  When I saw what they charged for it at\n            the health-food stores, I about fainted.\n\n     She hands Erin a printed fact sheet.  Erin scans it.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your\n            water being messed with and you being so\n            sick.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Not around here.  This is a rough part of\n            the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money,\n            not a lot of luck.\n                        (beat)\n            It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town\n            like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's driving away from Donna's house.  A street lamp throws\n     light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.\n\n     She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at\n     the massive COMPRESSOR STATION.  Six stories high, lit up\n     like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing\n     the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.\n     Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over\n     the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.\n\n     Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns\n     onto Community Boulevard and drives away.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears\n     NOISES coming from outside.  She follows them.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her\n     windows.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What're you doing?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Better safe than sorry.\n\n     She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You want some coffee, George?\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n     George follows Erin in.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front\n            door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest\n            neighborhood in the world, you know.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Thanks for reminding me.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I guess we get what we pay for, huh?\n\n     Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You think it could make you sick, living in\n            a place like this?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            What do you mean?\n\n     George settles in, helps himself to sugar.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I was talking to this lady -- she and her\n            husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's\n            cause they live in a bad neighborhood.  You\n            think that's possible?  That living in a bad\n            neighborhood could give you cancer?\n\n     George laughs a little at the thought.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Man, I hope not.  You got enough damn\n            problems.\n\n     But Erin's still mulling it over.\n\n     EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY\n\n     Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled\n     boots.  Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a\n     stoop, drinking their breakfast.  Erin approaches them.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?\n\n                               MAN 1\n            Hangin' in, baby.  How about yourself?\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm okay, I'm just fine.  I was wondering --\n            could I maybe ask you a couple questions?\n\n     She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.\n\n     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking.  He's thrilled to\n     have her back in his office.\n\n                               ERIN\n            ... and when I realized our area's just as\n            bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors\n            are all sick too.  So I went and asked.\n\n                               PAULSEN\n                        (surprised)\n            You did?\n\n     Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on\n            doors.  And you know what?  They're not.\n                        (reads from the pad)\n            I mean, they got problems, but none of this\n            cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So\n            I don't know -- I just can't shake the\n            feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they\n            put in the water.\n\n                               PAULSEN\n            Well, if you're talking about contamination,\n            you're getting out of my area of expertise.\n            Let me give you the name of a toxicologist\n            friend of mine over at USC.\n\n     Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.\n\n     INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.\n\n                               PAULSEN\n            I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I\n            did not peg you as the kind to go off and\n            conduct her own epidemiological study.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my\n            reputation.\n\n     EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY\n\n     Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus\n     with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,\n     Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much\n     as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.\n\n                               FRANKEL\n            What kind of chromium is it?\n\n                               ERIN\n            There's more than one kind?\n\n                               FRANKEL\n            Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does\n            all kinds of good things for the body.\n            There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and\n            then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,\n            which, depending on the amounts, can be very\n            harmful.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?\n\n                               FRANKEL\n            With repeated exposure to toxic levels --\n            God, anything, really -- respiratory\n            disease, liver failure, heart failure,\n            reproductive failure, chronic headaches,\n            bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of\n            course, any type of cancer.\n\n     He rattles it off coolly.

LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY\n\n     Drab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is\n     thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to\n     stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling\n     the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Whew!  Goddamn, that's a heavy door.\n\n     Ross looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right\n     off the page.

Here goes nothing.\n\n     She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.\n     They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,\n     Helendale -- in no particular order.

Not true.

The napkins fly from\n     their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips\n     into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe\n     at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall.\n\n                               ERIN\n            GOD DAMN IT!\n\n     As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts\n     to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.\n     She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.\n         \n                               ERIN\n                        (almost a whisper)\n            ...

MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Jane is delivering paychecks.  When Brenda gets to her desk,\n     Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it\n     out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            What's she doing here?\n         \n                               JANE\n            He hired her back.  With a raise.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            What??  Why?\n\n                               JANE\n            Well, let's see.  It's not cause she's\n            smart, and it's not cause she's\n            professional.  That leaves ...\n\n     Brenda's stunned.  Takes a beat.  Makes assumptions.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            And dumb old me thought working hard and\n            being loyal was the way to get ahead.\n\n     INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Ed is still checking his reflection.\n\n                               ED\n            I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the\n            fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed\n            that send button -- PG&E claims department\n            is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.\n\n                               ERIN\n            So you think we got 'em scared?\n\n                               ED\n            It sure as hell sounded like they were\n            sitting up and taking notice.\n\n     Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            David Baum from PG&E is at reception.\n         \n     Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.\n\n     Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\n     Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.\n     Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of\n     twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes\n     look brand new.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Not to question your judgment or anything,\n            Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look\n            like sitting up and taking notice to me.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n     Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say\n     this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He\n     doesn't talk; he squeaks.\n\n                               BAUM\n            ... in the interest of putting this whole\n            thing to rest, PG&E is willing to offer the\n            Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.\n\n     Ed laughs a little in disbelief.\n\n                               ED\n            250,000?\n\n                               BAUM\n            In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.\n            Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.\n\n                               ED\n            What about in terms of medical expenses?\n            250,000 doesn't come close to what this\n            family's gonna have to spend on doctors.\n\n                               BAUM\n            I understand they've had a bad run of luck,\n            health-wise, and they have my sympathies.\n            But that's not PG&E's fault.\n\n                               ED\n            You're kidding, right?\n                        (Baum doesn't answer)\n            Look at these readings for Christ's sake.\n            PG&E's own technicians documented toxic\n            levels of hexavalent chromium in those test\n            wells, on numerous occasions.\n\n     Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.\n\n                               ED\n            Everything the Irvings have had is a proven\n            reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.\n            They've had ...\n\n     He stalls a moment.  Erin jumps in.\n\n                               ERIN\n            -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's\n            disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,\n            chronic nosebleeds.\n\n     Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously\n     the party line:\n\n                               BAUM\n            A million things could have caused those\n            problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,\n            irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final\n            and more than fair.\n\n                               ED\n            Wait a minute -- I thought we were\n            negotiating here.\n\n                               BAUM\n            250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.\n\n     Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.\n\n                               ED\n                        (to himself)\n            Jesus Christ.\n                        (he stands, to leave)\n            I will present your offer to my clients.  I\n            doubt they'll accept it.\n\n     As Ed starts out:\n\n                               BAUM\n            Mr. Masry, before you go off on some\n            crusade, you might want to remember who it\n            is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28-\n            billion dollar corporation.\n\n                               ED\n                        (containing his anger)\n            Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.\n\n     And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\n     Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.\n\n                               ERIN\n            At least they made an offer.\n\n                               ED\n            That wasn't an offer.  A million would've\n            been an offer.  When they send the God damn\n            mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my\n            time, it's a fuck you.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I don't get why they'd do that.\n\n                               ED\n            Because they can.  You heard that kid --\n            they have 28 billion dollars at their\n            disposal.  They can afford to waste all the\n            time in the world.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And you can't?\n\n                               ED\n            What, you think I'm made of money?\n\n     Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.\n\n                               BAUM\n            Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My\n            plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.\n\n     Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.\n\n                               ED\n            Tell you what, why don't you go on over to\n            reception, tell them I said Mario should\n            take you to the airport.\n\n                               BAUM\n            Hey, excellent.

They'll be driving around the\n            valley for hours.\n\n                               ED\n                        (gleeful)\n            Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?\n\n     She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well I'll be God damned.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n     End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new\n     work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of\n     documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            You've been reading for hours.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact\n            that I look at the word \"dog\" and see \"god\".\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            Hey, just so long as you see Him.\n\n     Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.\n\n     Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to\n     a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and\n     TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope\n     under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter\n     the office and approach her.\n\n                               MANDY\n            Excuse me, are you Erin Brockovich?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah.  Who are you?\n\n                               TOM\n            I'm Tom Brown.  This is my wife Mandy.  We\n            used to live across the street from the\n            Irvings.  PG&E bought our house last year.\n\n     INT.

It's when they're\n            born without any muscles in the neck.\n\n     WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Wow.  How many were born like this?\n\n                               TOM\n            Twelve, maybe thirteen.\n\n                               MANDY\n            When Donna told us about you, and what you\n            told her about the chromium, we figured that\n            might have something to do with this, too.\n\n                               ERIN\n            It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.\n\n     She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.\n\n                               MANDY\n            There's something else, too.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What?\n\n                               TOM\n            Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Are you kidding?  My God --\n\n                               MANDY\n            I know.  It's an awful lot.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.\n\n                               TOM\n            She doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not\n            something you want to talk about, you know?\n\n                               MANDY\n            I figured it musta been something I did,\n            like when I smoked marijuana, maybe.  Or\n            took birth control pills.  But then Donna\n            told me you thought this chromium might be\n            to blame for her problems, so I figured ...\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off.  Erin comes\n     in, quietly, in clothes from work.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hey.  You guys still awake?\n\n     CLOSE ON MATT AND KATIE.

George told me he\n            just shut out the light a few seconds ago.\n\n     They still don't answer.

But the way this\n            job is, things come up at the last minute,\n            real important things, and I gotta deal with\n            them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner\n            any more than you do, but we're all gonna\n            have to get used to it, cause the fact is,\n            it's gonna happen sometimes.\n\n                               KATIE\n            It happens all the time.\n\n                               ERIN\n            That's not true; we had dinner together just\n            last night.\n\n                               MATT\n            You were reading the whole time.\n\n     He's got a point there.

ED'S MERCEDES - DAY\n\n     Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in\n     time.  This is his kind of music.

Yes, I did.  I\n            did, too, you just didn't feel it.\n\n     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK\n     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.\n\n                               ED\n            You think I could leave without kissing my\n            babys?  Okay, here you go.\n\n     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses\n     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.\n\n                               ED\n            Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,\n            together.

And second, I know you're\n            my boss and all, but you are the worst\n            fucking driver I've ever seen.  Move over or\n            I quit.\n\n     He moves over.

So PG&E figures,\n            we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the\n            people the water's not perfect; if we can\n            ride out the year with no one suing, we'll\n            be in the clear forever.\n\n                               DONNA\n            But it was more than a year ago that they\n            told us --\n\n                               ED\n            It's okay.

This way, and PG&E can\n            still look good to their shareholders, cause\n            they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all\n            they're doing is buying a little property.\n\n     Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.\n\n                               ROY\n            It doesn't say here how much this whole\n            thing's gonna cost us.\n\n                               ED\n            My fee's forty percent of whatever you get\n            awarded.\n\n     Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the\n     figure.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Boy, do I know how you feel.

But\n     just almost.  She shifts gears.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Then I asked him how much he makes if I\n            didn't get anything.\n\n     They look at Ed.

They hand the agreements\n     over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He\n     stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.\n\n                               ED\n            All right, then.  Let's hit the road.\n\n     Boy.  Cold as ice.

Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete\n     and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally:\n\n                               ED\n            So, what's, uh ... what's new?\n\n     INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.

I just figured it was\n            something in the genes.  And you know how it\n            is -- you don't like to ask about things\n            like that ...\n\n     Erin listens, interested.\n\n     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY\n\n     Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,\n     tossing hay around.\n\n                               ERIN (O.S.)\n            Excuse me.

I work at the law firm\n            that represents your former neighbors the\n            Browns.  They suggested I give you a call.\n\n     She steps in a cow patty.

But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look\n     swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that\n     she's in a lot of pain.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly\n            what it was that you had --\n\n                               PETE\n            She's not alone on that one.\n\n                               LAURA\n            Well, they know what it is -- it's called\n            fibrous dysplasia --\n\n                               PETE\n            The bones start growing again.

RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter\n     ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.\n\n                               ERIN\n            ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing\n            you folks at the hospital from time to time\n            too, so I thought I'd just stop by.\n                        (to Annabelle)\n            You must be Annabelle.\n\n                               ANNABELLE\n            Uh-huh.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Whew, are you ever a beauty.

George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is\n     empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:\n\n     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's\n     chair in Matthew and Katie's room.\n\n     Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin\n     hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Tell me something, George.  What kind of God\n            lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get\n            brain cancer?  Isn't He supposed to be in\n            charge of stuff like that?  Make sure it\n            doesn't happen?\n                        (beat)\n            I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.\n\n     EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY\n\n     Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups\n     in their hands.  Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much\n     of a lather to drink hers.\n\n                               ED\n            Hunh-uh.

Look -- the only reason\n            PG&E's even talking to us is cause this is a\n            quiet little real estate dispute.  We add\n            plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle\n            of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --\n            against a massive utility.

Something\n            like this, Erin -- it could take forever.\n            They're a huge corporation.  They'd\n            completely bury us in paperwork.

Not\n            only does it attack every organ of the body,\n            it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means\n            these people's genes, and the genes of their\n            kids, and the genes of their grandkids --\n\n                               ED\n            I know how DNA works, Erin --\n\n     He gets to the Masry & Vititoe doors.

Over this:\n\n                               ERIN (O.S.)\n            Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me\n            something: if I wanna find as much evidence\n            of hexavalent chromium contamination as I\n            possibly can, what should I do?\n\n     As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side\n     of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT\n\n     Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked\n     \"No Trespassing\".  Her arms are full of more containers.\n\n                               FRANKEL (O.S.)\n            Well, what you have to remember is, if you\n            have hex chrom in the water, you have it in\n            anything that lived off the water.\n\n     She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the\n     trunk of her car.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Another day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way\n     down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.\n\n                               FRANKEL (O.S.)\n            What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything\n            that existed in water, on water, under water\n            ...\n\n     She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of\n     rancid pool water and seals it.\n\n                               FRANKEL (O.S.)\n            anything that had water flow over or under\n            it ...\n\n     Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up\n     by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.\n\n     EXT. WELL - DAY\n\n     With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up\n     over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against\n     one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts\n     shimmying down the well.\n\n                               FRANKEL (O.S.)\n            anything that had water pass through it ...\n\n     INSIDE THE WELL\n\n     she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as\n     she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she\n     takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY\n\n     Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,\n     adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.\n\n                               FRANKEL (O.S.)\n            ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em\n            to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.\n\n     ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: \"water sample A ...\",\n     \"soil sample D ...\", \"frog sample A ...\", \"... traces of\n     hexavalent ...\"\n\n     Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            For God's sake, Erin, I can see your\n            panties.\n\n     Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Liar.  I'm not wearing any.\n\n     Ed, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     It's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the\n     kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading\n     a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin\n     picks it up.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hello?\n\n                               MALE VOICE (O.S.)\n            Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's\n            been snooping around the water board?\n\n     His voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yes.  Who's this?\n\n     CLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT\n\n     George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone\n            call, George.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your\n            bills, not put you in danger.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt.\n            Remember?\n\n     She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks\n     in there.  George follows.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Look, don't take this the wrong way, but\n            don't you think you might be out of your\n            league here?\n\n                               ERIN\n            No, see -- that's exactly what those\n            arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that\n            because they got all this money and power,\n            we don't stand a chance in hell against\n            them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.\n\n     She heads into the bedrooms.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            It doesn't have to be this complicated,\n            Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (off-hand)\n            How would you know?\n\n     George reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into:\n\n     INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Matt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows.\n     George comes in.  They whisper.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            You mind telling me what that's supposed to\n            mean?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Nothing.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            If you got a problem with me taking care of\n            your kids instead of getting some job, just\n            say so.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I didn't say that.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can\n            start leaving the kids with the chicken fat\n            lady again.  Would that make you happy?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Keep your voice down.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I\n            probably know it better than you.\n\n     She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.\n\n     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY\n\n     Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of\n     files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E\n            pay you to cover their ass, or do you just\n            do it out of the kindness of your heart?\n\n                               ROSS\n                        (a bad liar)\n            I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n                               ERIN\n            The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee.\n            That heavy-breathing sicko that called the\n            other night could've only found out about me\n            from you.\n                        (beat)\n            People are dying, Ross.  You got document\n            after document here, right under your nose,\n            that says why, and you haven't said word one\n            about it.  I wanna know how the hell you\n            sleep at night.\n\n     Ross is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the\n     box to the floor and goes to work.\n\n     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes\n     rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it\n     slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to\n     get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a\n     bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car\n     appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out\n     and drives off.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT\n\n     A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An\n     empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving,\n     exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone.\n\n                               GEORGE (O.S.)\n            Hello?\n\n     INTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the\n            road.  Keep me awake, willya?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            What do you want, a joke?\n\n                               ERIN\n            No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me\n            about your day.  What went on back there?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Well, come to think of it, we did have a big\n            event around here.  Beth started talking.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What?\n                        (beat)\n            Beth?  My Beth?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and\n            she pointed at a ball and said, \"ball.\"\n\n     Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,\n     feeling all hollowed-out.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I'd never seen that before -- someone's\n            first word.  Pretty intense.\n\n     Erin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls\n     down her cheek.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY\n\n     CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes\n     them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.\n\n                               ED\n            Is that what I think it is?\n\n                               ERIN\n            She lived on the plume.  You never know.\n         \n     Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking\n     at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The\n     recipient's name comes up again: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY\n\n     Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie\n     and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped\n     being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired.\n\n     BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they\n     sign retainer agreements.\n\n     ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a\n     swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green.\n\n                               ERIN\n            This was the community pool?\n\n                               WOMAN 1\n            Yeah, that PG&E built.  The whole time we\n            thought it was algae that made it so green.\n\n     LATER ...\n\n     Erin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters\n     of retainer agreements into the \"PLAINTIFFS\" binder.\n\n     LATER STILL ...\n\n     Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She\n     sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I'm bored, and so are the kids.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Just a few more minutes, then we can go.\n                        (as he heads off)\n            Take her, will you?\n\n     George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads\n     over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.\n\n     As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he\n     dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his\n     50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure\n     his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working\n     the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet\n     into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY\n     OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.\n\n     LATER STILL ...\n\n     Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,\n     when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works\n            over at the compressor station --\n\n     Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.\n\n     LATER STILL ...\n\n     Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of\n     her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks\n     out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches\n     him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.\n\n                               ERIN\n             I'm sorry.  What were you saying?\n\n     LATER ...\n\n     The barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his\n     Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I need a ride.\n\n     INT. ED'S CAR - DAY\n\n     Ed is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the\n     passenger seat.  After a beat:\n\n                               ED\n            You wanna talk about --\n         \n                               ERIN\n            No.\n\n     Another beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into\n     her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What, asshole?\n\n     There's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the\n     line, very strained:\n\n                               MIKE AMBROSINO (O.S.)\n            Um, Erin?  This is Mike.  Ambrosino.\n\n     EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY\n\n     The curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are\n     at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.\n         \n                               MIKE\n            She was about to take a handful of these --\n\n     He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.\n\n                               MIKE\n            It's a morphine thing -- for pain --\n\n     Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:\n\n     INT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Erin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying\n     in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers.\n\n                               LAURA\n            I'm embarrassed.\n\n                               ERIN\n            That's okay.  I understand.\n\n                               LAURA\n            It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting\n            worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be\n            a good mother.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm real sorry, Laura.\n\n     Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat.\n\n                               LAURA\n            Know what I always thought I wanted outta\n            life, Erin?  A Jaguar.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Jaguar's a darn pretty car.\n\n                               LAURA\n            I thought if I could spend that kinda money\n            on a car, it'd mean everything else was\n            fine.\n                        (beat)\n            I don't even know how much they cost.\n\n                               ERIN\n            A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll\n            get one.\n\n     Laura shakes her head.\n\n                               LAURA\n            Wouldn't mean the same thing.\n\n     Erin watches her sadly.\n\n     INT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY\n\n     A LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk\n     through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both\n     in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour.\n\n     EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY\n\n     George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the\n     sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.\n     He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.\n\n     In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his\n     pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it\n     to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.\n     The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN\n     BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They\n     look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous.\n\n     When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.\n     George just stands there and watches them go.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT\n\n     His office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and\n     a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant\n     cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;\n\n     Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.\n\n                               ERIN\n            They used the hex chrom here, in these\n            cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then\n            they dumped it here, in these six ponds.\n\n                               ED\n            I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.\n\n     She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.\n\n                               ERIN\n            They covered 'em over.  And not too\n            carefully either, cause you dig one inch\n            under the surface, and the dirt is green as\n            a fucking shamrock.\n\n                               ED\n            And that's what caused the contamination?\n\n                               ERIN\n            It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's\n            on the bottom.\n\n     She reaches for a document, reads from it.\n\n                               ERIN\n            See, according to this, they were supposed\n            to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep\n            into the ground.  But guess what --\n\n                               ED\n            They skipped that step.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I guess it was a little too inconvenient.\n            So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed\n            into the groundwater, free as you please.\n\n                               ED\n            Jesus.\n                        (beat)\n            I don't even wanna ask what you did to make\n            this Melendez guy talk.\n\n     In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.\n\n                               ERIN\n            For your information, Frank cares what was\n            in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half\n            his day wading around them.  That was his\n            job.\n\n                               ED\n            No shit.\n\n                               ERIN\n            No --\n\n     Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --\n\n                               ERIN\n            SHIT!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!\n\n     Tears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth.\n     Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.\n     She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until\n     the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You ... asshole ...\n\n     Ed chuckles.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER\n\n     The tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying\n     on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working.\n\n                               ED\n            Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da\n            put three researchers on this, I wouldn't\n            expect them to dig up all the information\n            you got here.  This is some damn good work.\n         \n                               ERIN\n            Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.\n\n                               ED\n            Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I\n            haven't billed a minute of my time since I\n            started on this case, so you can quit\n            hitting me up like I'm rich or something.\n\n     He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room\n     with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty\n            rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got\n            those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.\n\n                               ED\n            We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the\n            balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we\n            can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers\n            in San Francisco.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What do you mean?\n\n                               ED\n            PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way\n            of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, they knew.  They had to know.\n\n                               ED\n            Show me the document that proves that.\n\n     She doesn't have one.\n\n                               ED\n            Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't\n            know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.\n            And punitive damages is where the money is.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I\n            work on this thing, the more I realize what\n            a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here\n            we got a company that poisoned a whole\n            aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,\n            then filled it with toxic water -- and we're\n            the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving\n            things?  That's just not right.\n\n     Beat.  Ed smiles.\n\n\n                               ED\n            I like this case.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Really?  It makes me sick.\n\n                               ED\n            Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a\n            long time since I had a case I cared about.\n\n                               ERIN\n            You didn't care about my case?\n\n                               ED\n            I would now.\n\n     He gives her a long look.\n\n                               ED\n            Hey.  I like working with you.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you\n            too.\n\n     They both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then:\n\n                               ED\n            When'd you start calling me Ed?\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT\n\n     The Christmas party.  The office is decorated; someone is\n     Santa.  Erin and George enter, all dressed up.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's giving George a guided tour.  As they head down the\n     hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it\n\n                               GEORGE\n            I'm just saying -- we have one night to\n            ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Cause it's my office party.  If you had an\n            office, I'd go to your party.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT\n\n     It's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And here, ta-daa, is my desk.\n\n     She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as\n     a present on it.  Erin's is empty.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Which one?\n                        (it's obvious)\n            Maybe they didn't think you were coming.\n\n     Erin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is.\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (quietly)\n            God damn.  I work so hard.  The least they\n            could do ...\n\n     George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He\n     goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh?\n\n     He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more.\n\n                               GEORGE\n                        (quietly)\n            See?  All we need is each other.\n\n     She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some\n     more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?\n            That mighta hurt.\n\n     She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She\n     pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.\n\n     INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much\n     younger than Ed, and very pretty.\n\n                               ED\n            I'll show you what we did back here --\n\n     INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT\n\n     Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk,\n     hear the voices.  Erin pulls away.\n\n                               ERIN\n            That's Ed.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Lock the door.\n\n                               ERIN\n            No, I wanna say hi.\n\n     He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            We'll say hi later.  Lock it.\n\n     But Erin pulls away ...\n\n                               ERIN\n            Come on, George, it's a party.\n\n     He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from\n     him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther.\n\n     INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER\n\n     Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing.\n\n     NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly.\n\n                               JOEY\n            Your wife's real pretty.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            She's not my wife.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin\n     fight.\n\n                               GEORGE (O.S.)\n            It wouldn't kill you to talk about\n            something other than yourself and your own\n            fucking job once in a while --\n\n                               ERIN (O.S.)\n            What do you want to talk about instead?\n            Your day?  That's a fascinating subject.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day\n            trying to prove what hot shit I am --\n\n                               ERIN\n            That is not what I'm --\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Bullshit, Erin.  Bullshit.\n\n     The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Great.  Excellent.  Thank you very much.\n\n     She leaves the room.\n\n     INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Beth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt\n     and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth:\n\n                               ERIN\n            It's okay, baby.  It'll be okay.\n\n     She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall\n     and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin\n     starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.\n\n     EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT\n\n     Late, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property\n     seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone\n     inside the gates, staring up at the station.\n\n     After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.\n     It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He\n     reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another.\n     He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then,\n     overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.\n\n     INT. IRVINGS' HOUSE, DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n     Donna's sitting quietly in bed.  Erin is sitting on the edge\n     of the bed.\n\n                               DONNA\n            I'd got so used to having 'em come up\n            benign, I guess I just didn't expect it.\n\n     She looks down her shirt front.\n\n                               DONNA\n            Sure wish I had longer to get used to the\n            idea.\n                        (beat)\n            You think if you got no uterus, and no\n            breasts, you're still technically a woman?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman,\n            cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads\n            and underwire.\n\n     Donna smiles a little.  Then her face crumbles.\n\n                               DONNA\n            We're gonna get them, aren't we, Erin?  You\n            gotta promise me we're gonna get them.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, DAY\n\n     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED\n\n     as DOCUMENTS are faxed once again to the PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.\n\n     THEN AGAIN, on another day.\n\n     AND AGAIN, on another day.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window.\n     Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that\n     has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance.\n\n                               ERIN\n            If they've sent that little shmuck Baum\n            again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.\n\n                               ED\n            From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd\n            say they're taking us more seriously.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah, I heard that one before.\n\n     Brenda leans her head in.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.\n            Cooper, from PG&E are here.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n\n     Talk about moving up the food chain.  MS. SANCHEZ, MR.\n     WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the\n     reception area like sharks.  They all ooze importance.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.\n\n                               ED\n            They're trying to intimidate us.\n                        (then, to Brenda)\n            Tell them to wait in the conference room.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n     Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.\n\n     The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.\n     Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm.  Followed by Anna\n     (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under\n     her arm.  Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who\n     knows where), legal pad under his arm.  If you didn't know\n     better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.\n\n                               ED\n            Counselors --\n\n                               MR.

MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER\n\n     Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed\n     and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.\n\n                               SANCHEZ\n            Let's be honest, here.  Two million dollars\n            is more money than these people have ever\n            dreamed of.\n\n     Erin has no patience for this today.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, see, now that pisses me off.  First of\n            all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.\n            They may not be sophisticated, but they do\n            know how to divide, and two million dollars\n            isn't shit when it's split between them.\n\n     Mario and Anna exchange a look.  This is getting interesting.\n\n                               ED\n            Erin --\n\n     But there's no stopping her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And second of all -- these people don't\n            dream about being rich.  They dream about\n            being able to watch their kids swim in a\n            pool without worrying they'll have to have a\n            hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a\n            client of ours -- or have their spine\n            deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client\n            of ours.  So before you come back here with\n            another lame-ass offer, I want you to think\n            real hard about what your spine is worth,\n            Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to\n            pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --\n            then you take out your calculator and\n            multiply that number by a hundred.  Anything\n            less than that is a waste of our time.\n\n     And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY\n\n     Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.\n     Beyond her, the PG&E lawyers are filing out of the office.\n     Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.\n\n                               ANNA\n            Um, Erin?\n                        (Erin turns)\n            Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily\n            my favorite person in the world ...\n                        (beat)\n            ... sometimes you're not half-bad.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I'm gonna assume that was meant as a\n            compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents\n     and files.  She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on\n     the page, and COUGHING while she works.  Ed calls to her.\n\n                                ED\n            Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet\n            you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.\n\n                                ERIN\n            D'you get his name?\n                        (no answer)\n            Course not.  Jesus, Ed --\n\n                                ED\n            He said he'd be at the gas station at six.\n\n                                ERIN\n            Boy, this job takes me to some of the best\n            damn places, huh?\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET\n\n     Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the\n     bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION\n     ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.\n\n                                ERIN\n            This is the only station in town, right?\n\n                               ATTENDANT\n            Yup.\n\n     He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again.\n     Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing.\n\n     Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint\n     of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:\n     the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.\n\n     Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back\n     at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.\n     She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.\n\n     Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She\n     jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it\n     won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has\n     gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around\n     again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.\n\n     Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels\n     out of the gas station.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n     Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus\n     on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.\n\n     She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has\n     to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce\n     off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.\n     Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back\n     at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the\n     headlights, the train, the headlights ...\n\n     Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last\n     train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car\n     over the tracks.  The truck follows.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT\n\n     The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck.\n\n     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT\n\n     She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No\n     other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT\n\n     The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following.\n\n     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT\n\n     Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the\n     truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST\n     CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's\n     Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.\n\n     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT\n\n     Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She\n     rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Someone's following me.\n\n                               ED\n            What?  Who?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was\n            alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.\n            Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.\n\n     Ed gets up and heads toward the door.\n\n                               ED\n                        (to the counter guy)\n            Beer, please.\n\n     As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.\n\n                               ED\n            What kind of truck?\n\n                               ERIN\n            I don't know.  Big.  Dark.\n\n                               ED\n            He's gone.\n                        (back to the table)\n            Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?\n\n                               ERIN\n            No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,\n            I didn't have time to check those things --\n\n                               ED\n            I was just asking.

Shaky, tired, drawn.\n\n                               ED\n            Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the\n            last time you had a decent night's sleep?\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n     Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.\n     Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out.\n\n     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT\n\n     Ed swings by Erin's open car window.\n\n                               ED\n            Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n     Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each\n     rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.\n     Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.\n\n                               ED\n            Lock the door every which way you can.  And\n            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever\n            -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.\n\n     She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:\n\n                               ERIN\n            I think you should know -- there's very few\n            people in the world who don't piss me off 90\n            percent of the time.\n                        (beat)\n            You're one of 'em.\n\n     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look\n     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long\n     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.\n\n                               ED\n            I'm triple locking my door, so don't even\n            think of trying to take advantage.\n\n     She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door\n     behind her before going inside himself.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT\n\n     George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.

ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast.

You know you can't leave\n            them alone like that.\n\n     He doesn't answer.  Doesn't move.  She notices this.\n\n                             ERIN\n            What's going on?  What are you doing?\n\n                             GEORGE\n            Thinking.\n\n                               ERIN\n            About what?\n\n     He's very calm.

I saw 'em in the\n            mall one day, and I thought, damn, those\n            would look good on those beautiful earlobes.\n            So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next\n            time Erin says something nice, does\n            something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.\n                        (beat)\n            Know how long ago that was?

Cause there\n            may be men who don't mind being the maid and\n            getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as\n            shit not one of 'em.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I can't leave my job, George.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Yeah, you can.

Look -- this job -- it's the best\n            thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it.\n            For the first time in my life, I got people\n            respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a\n            room and everyone shuts up just to hear what\n            I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever.\n            Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            More than you need me.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I need it.\n\n     He nods, then stands, to leave.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Maybe you didn't like who you were before,\n            Erin, but I did.

ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.\n     George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his\n     bike.

Erin reaches over and turns it\n     off.  Matthew turns it back on.  Erin glares at him, turns it\n     off.  On/off/on/off.  A test of wills.  Finally, when Matthew\n     turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob\n     off the stereo and throws it out the window.\n\n     EXT.

POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n     CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.\n\n     WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts\n     and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.\n\n     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY\n\n     Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally,\n     rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses\n     it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY\n\n     Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes\n     out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.\n\n     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED\n\n     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up\n     again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.\n\n     INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY\n\n     A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the\n     way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still\n     dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now.\n     The floor around her is littered with tissues.\n\n     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels.  Annabelle is\n     curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket.  Rita and Ted\n     notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY\n\n     Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone.  She's\n     talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern\n     European nanny, vacuuming the hall.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I know she isn't real warm, but they say\n            she's a real good lawyer ...\n\n     INTERCUT WITH\n\n     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Ted Daniels is on the phone.  Rita is next to him.\n\n                               TED\n            That may be.  But I don't want her coming to\n            the house again.  She's kinda stuck-up, and\n            she upsets Annabelle.  Now, I hate to say\n            this, but when she left today, Rita asked if\n            we should get a new lawyer.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Ted, no -- don't do that.  If you don't like\n            Theresa, you don't have to work with her.\n            Me and Ed are still here for you.\n\n                               TED\n            I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still\n            hasn't called me back.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY\n\n     The phone rings.  Brenda picks up.\n\n                               BRENDA\n            Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be\n            interrupted.\n\n     INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?\n            Just put him on.\n\n                               BRENDA\n                        (with finality)\n            I said, he can't be interrupted.\n\n     Erin hangs up.  Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body\n     out of bed.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY\n\n     Erin drags herself into the office.\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick\n            day.\n\n                               ERIN\n            So did I.\n\n     She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a\n     meeting in progress in the conference room.  Ed is on the\n     side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.\n     On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What's going on in there?\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            Some meeting.  With PG&E people.\n\n                               ERIN\n            PG& -- Are you sure?\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            Yup.  They must be important, too, cause\n            they came on a special plane.\n\n     Erin feels this like a sock in the gut.  She stares at the\n     meeting, stunned.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n     This band of PG&E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive\n     of all.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most\n     senior PG&E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.\n\n                               CORBIN\n            ... we would enter into binding arbitration\n            -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be\n            between 50 and 400 million dollars.\n\n     Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.\n\n                               POTTER\n            Any preconditions on the settlements?\n\n                               CORBIN\n            The plaintiffs have to agree to it\n            unanimously.  And they're barred from ever\n            discussing their settlement with anyone.\n\n                               ED\n            50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of\n            a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.\n\n                               HEAD COUNSEL\n            50-400 million dollars is a great deal of\n            money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.\n\n     As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,\n\n     ERIN\n\n     staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her\n     face cold with hurt and anger.\n\n                               ED\n            Could I -- just take a brief break here for\n            a moment?  I'll be right back.\n\n     He gets up and goes out into:\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY\n\n     Ed comes out.  Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.\n\n                               ERIN\n            If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your\n            fucking head off --\n\n                               ED\n            Erin, it's just a meeting.\n\n                               ERIN\n            People don't fly down in their own god damn\n            plane for \"just a meeting\" --\n\n                               ED\n            Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I\n            thought you should rest.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if\n            it suited you.\n\n                               ED\n            Okay, look.  It's an important meeting.\n            Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think\n            anymore?\n\n     He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.\n\n                               ED\n            Look, this is serious now.  They're talking\n            serious money --\n\n                               ERIN\n            And, what, I'm not serious?\n\n                               ED\n            You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say\n            any God damn thing that comes into your\n            head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That\n            can be great; that can be a lot of fun --\n\n                               ERIN\n            \"Fun?\"  Jesus, \"fun?\"  I kill myself for a\n            year and a half, hand you the best case of\n            your life on a God damn silver platter,\n            remind you of why you became a lawyer in the\n            first place, and you think of me as \"fun?\"\n\n                               ED\n            Okay, now you're making this personal, and\n            it isn't --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Not personal?  That's my work in there, Ed.\n            My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not\n            personal, I don't know what is.\n\n     She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (weakened)\n            How dare you take that away from me.\n\n                               ED\n            No one's taking anything --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating\n            to some God damn steno clerk so you could\n            finish this thing without me.  After all\n            I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.\n\n     By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in\n     the conference room.\n\n                               ED\n            Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty.\n            You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of\n            perks ...\n\n                               ERIN\n            Perks?  Jesus -- perks?\n\n     Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.\n\n                               ERIN\n            If this piece of shit is supposed to take\n            the place of your respect, you can take it\n            and shove it up your ass.\n\n     She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the\n     glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just\n     stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the\n     splintered glass wall.\n\n     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n     Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM\n     SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it\n     off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the\n     siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her\n     headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small\n     boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Holy shit --\n\n     She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.\n     She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS.\n\n     Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit,\n     is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Matthew --\n\n     She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,\n     blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs\n     the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Matthew!  MATTHEW!\n\n     She catches up and collars him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you\n            doing out here?\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            I'm gonna go live with George.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is\n     yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over\n     her, barely containing herself.\n\n                               ERIN\n            If you leave here real fast, I might not\n            kill you.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the\n     foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed.\n\n                               ERIN\n            We'll work out the roller hockey thing,\n            okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out.\n            I promise.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            You always say that.  Then you go to work\n            and forget you promised.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard.\n            It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to\n            be able to organize things right and -- when\n            it comes to you guys, I end up falling\n            short.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            You never fall short for the work people.  I\n            guess maybe you just love them more.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on\n            Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.\n                        (beat)\n            I promise.\n\n     She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and\n     inches away from her.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n     Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the\n     door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold.\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with\n     Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.

ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER\n\n     Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to\n     Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?\n\n                               ED\n            Uh-huh.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And if you had to guess ...\n\n                               ED\n            With nothing linking it to the corporate\n            offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the\n            lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.\n\n                               ERIN\n            So why would PG&E offer it?\n\n                               ED\n            Because.  They know the evidence; they know\n            they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they\n            wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once\n            you factor in all they'd spend on this case\n            in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Wait, what do you mean, ten years?\n\n                               ED\n            Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that\n            for the appeal.\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (confused)\n            I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing\n            goes to trial, it'll be ten years before\n            these plaintiffs see their money?\n\n                               ED\n            Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the\n            Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and\n            those people still haven't seen a dime.  So\n            in legal terms, ten years is --\n\n                               ERIN\n            Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human\n            beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of\n            them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They\n            need their money now!\n                        (beat)\n            We gotta get 'em to agree to the\n            arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn\n            one of those plaintiffs to --\n\n                               ED\n            I know.  We're having a meeting, it's all\n            set up --\n\n                               ERIN\n            When?  Where?\n\n                               ED\n            Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to\n            tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --\n\n                               ED\n            You're not gonna be there.\n\n                               ERIN\n            The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the\n            doctor says --\n\n                               ED\n            This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.

You know what Kurt Potter\n            is?  He's the kind of guy who never would\n            have taken this case in the first place.\n            He's the kind of guy who would have sold\n            these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E\n            offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like\n            us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head\n            telling him to do the right thing.\n\n     But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave.\n\n                               ED\n            Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do,\n            I'm gonna have to fire you.\n                        (beat)\n            Just ... concentrate on getting well.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed,\n     Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their\n     notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them.\n     Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,\n     distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights\n     criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit\n     still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take\n     it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.\n\n     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a\n     release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.\n\n     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER\n\n     It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with\n     horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with\n     the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised\n     platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.\n\n                               POTTER\n            Binding arbitration isn't all that different\n            from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge.\n            Evidence is presented in much the same way.\n\n     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n     Erin unbuckles her seat belt.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.\n\n     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a\n     window and looks in at the packed meeting.\n\n                               PLAINTIFF (O.S.)\n            And then a jury decides?\n\n                               POTTER (O.S.)\n            No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.\n            There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No\n            jury, and no appeal.\n\n     She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.\n\n                               BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)\n            No appeal?  So what are our options if we\n            don't like the result?\n\n                               POTTER (O.S.)\n            Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision\n            is final.  But I really don't anticipate\n            that as a problem.\n\n     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is\n     thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats,\n     whispering to each other.\n\n                               TOM BROWN\n            You don't even know what it's gonna be; how\n            do you know we're gonna like it?\n\n     Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.\n\n                               POTTER\n            As I said before, it will definitely be\n            somewhere between 50 and 400 million\n            dollars.\n\n                               MANDY BROWN\n            Which?  There's a big difference there.\n\n                               POTTER\n            I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.\n\n                               MANDY BROWN\n            Ed -- what do you think it'll be?\n\n     Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.\n\n                               ED\n            I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't\n            speculate.\n\n                               MANDY BROWN\n            So then, what, that mystery number's divided\n            up at the whim of some judge --\n\n                               POTTER\n            Judges don't make decisions based on whim,\n            ma'am.  They make them based on precedent\n            and evidence.\n\n     The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More\n     whispering, more movement.\n\n     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Fucking idiot --\n\n     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control.\n\n                               POTTER\n            Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision?\n            Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you\n            put a little faith in the system, you'll be\n            quite pleased with the outcome.\n\n     Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.\n\n                               TED DANIELS\n            Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd\n            know that being pleased isn't an option for\n            me anymore.  Now don't take this personally,\n            sir, but I've never seen you before in my\n            life.  I'm not about to put my faith in\n            anything just cause you tell me to.\n\n     He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand\n     and heads for the door.\n\n     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.\n     Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away.\n\n     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor\n     is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.\n\n     She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a\n     release form, and leaves the firehouse.\n\n     EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT\n\n     Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.\n     Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.\n\n     INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT\n\n     A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out\n     on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Can I have one of those counter thingies,\n            please?\n\n     The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers.\n     She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number\n     of copies: 635.  Presses \"START.\"  The machine WHIRS to life.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT\n\n     Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.\n\n                              MATTHEW (O.S.)\n            I don't want to stay here.  It smells.\n\n     INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.\n\n                               ERIN\n            We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it\n            home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into\n            bed.\n\n     As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the\n     phone and dials.  RING, RING.\n\n                               GEORGE (O.S.)\n            Hello?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hi.

You're\n            the only one I trust them with.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY\n\n     Very early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to\n     the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She\n     turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.\n\n     EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n     Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I got you your own room.\n\n     He takes it, glances toward the motel room.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            They up?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hunh-uh.

Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.\n\n     She hands him a wad of cash.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            How long's this whole thing gonna take?\n\n                               ERIN\n            I don't know.  Few days.\n                        (beat)\n            Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.\n\n     He nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door,\n     she turns back to him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And I miss you.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.\n\n     She sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I treated you real bad, George.  I know\n            that.  But, my problem was -- I never been\n            with anyone who deserved better than that.\n            You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.\n\n     George softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently\n     closes her door, so he's standing close to her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I just ... didn't know how to handle it.\n            That's all.\n\n     He thinks about this.  Finally:\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Think you could learn?\n\n                               ERIN\n                        (with a smile)\n            You know me.  I pick things up real fast.\n\n     He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of\n     hair out of her eyes.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            You shouldn't be driving around, you know.\n            You're sick.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of\n            these folks aren't.\n\n     He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck\n     and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear\n     and pulls out.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY\n\n     Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road.\n\n     INT.

DONNA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to\n     cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into\n     the driveway.

DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n     Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna.\n\n                               DONNA\n            I don't know, Erin -- the way he was talking\n            to us, telling us everything was gonna be\n            fine -- I just didn't trust him.\n\n                               PETE\n            And after all we been through -- no jury, no\n            appeal.  It just makes me nervous.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I understand all that. And I don't wanna\n            force you into anything.  If you don't want\n            to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk\n            it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for\n            you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.\n\n     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n     The door opens.

DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY\n\n     Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto.\n     Erin has a signed release form in her hand.\n\n     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY\n\n     DISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has\n     a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has\n     Bob Linwood's signature.\n\n     IN THE FRONT SEAT\n\n     Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list\n     of plaintiffs.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING\n\n     People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is\n     stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.\n\n                               RITA\n            I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's\n            gonna take years\n\n     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT\n\n     The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.\n     Erin drops five more agreements into the \"signed\" box.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the\n     cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,\n     alphabetizing.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n     CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed\n     against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room,\n     WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind\n     her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What time is it?\n\n                               GEORGE\n            Real early.  We're just gonna take your car\n            to get some breakfast.\n\n     Erin forces herself awake.\n\n                               ERIN\n            No, I need my car --\n\n                               GEORGE\n            We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more\n            sleep.\n\n     He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the\n     room to Matthew.\n\n                               GEORGE\n            C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go.\n\n     Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?\n            I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back.\n\n     But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention.\n     He looks up at Erin.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            This girl's the same age as me.\n\n     Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to\n     shield him from the harsh realities of this case.\n\n                               ERIN\n            That's right, sweetheart.\n\n     She replaces the form on top of the stack.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            She's one of the sick people?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Yeah.  She is.\n                        (beat)\n            But you know what?  That's why I'm helping\n            her.  So she can get some medicine to make\n            her feel better.\n\n     Matthew mulls this over a bit more.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            How come her own mom isn't helping her?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Cause her own mom's real sick, too.\n\n     Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the\n     door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.\n     Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.\n\n                               MATTHEW\n            Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.\n            You want eggs?\n\n     She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward\n     acceptance.  Smiles, moved.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect.\n\n     INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY\n\n     Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs\n     out of a take-out container with her fingers.\n\n     EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY\n\n     Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck\n     pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and\n     wanders up to the men.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today?\n\n     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY\n\n     She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY\n\n     Morning drop-off time.  Erin is handing out release forms zo\n     a GROUP of MOTHERS who just dropped off their kids.\n\n     EXT. HINKLEY MART - NIGHT\n\n     Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list\n     of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.\n\n     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY\n\n     Another day.  Erin has set up shop here and is at a table\n     with about FIVE PLAINTIFFS, all reading agreements.  MIKE\n     AMBROSINO enters.  Erin spots him.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Mike!  I been looking all over for you.\n            Come here, I wanna talk to you.\n\n     INT.

BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY\n\n     And still bigger.\n\n     EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT\n\n     CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.  A bunch more forms get thrown onto\n     the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.\n\n                               ERIN (O.S.)\n            I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to\n            some folks out there tonight.\n\n     WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.\n\n                               GEORGE (O.S.)\n            Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.\n\n                               ERIN\n            I will.  Bye.\n\n     She hangs up.  As she turns to get into her car, she finds\n     herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Jesus!\n\n     He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.\n     She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Okay, what're you gonna do?  You gonna kill\n            me?  Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?  Or\n            maybe you just wanna inject me with some\n            poison too -- why change tactics at this\n            stage of the game?\n                        (beat)\n            Get outta my way, you make me sick.\n\n     She pushes past him.  But he grabs her by the arm.  He's a\n     big guy; it's a strong grab.  Now she's scared.  For a\n     moment, he does nothing.  Just looks at her.  Then:\n\n                               DARK GLASSES\n            If PG&E made someone destroy a whole lot of\n            documents -- would that matter to you?\n\n     Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.  She\n     gently pulls her arm away.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well ... I guess that depends on what the\n            documents were.\n                        (she takes a beat)\n            I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.\n\n                               DARK GLASSES\n            Embry.  Charles Embry.\n\n     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT\n\n     Erin and Embry are the only patrons.  Erin's eating a burger.\n     Embry has a beer.  He's talking quietly, not looking at her.\n\n                               EMBRY\n            I was working in the compressor, and out of\n            nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the\n            office and says, we're gonna give you a\n            shredder machine, and send you on down to\n            the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of\n            all the documents stored out there.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Did he say why?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            Nope.  And I didn't ask.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Did you get a look at the stuff you\n            destroyed?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --\n            you gotta find some way to entertain your\n            mind.  So yeah, I took a look.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And ...?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation\n            schedules, the like.\n                        (beat)\n            But then there were a few memos about the\n            holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had\n            readings from test wells, stuff like that.\n\n     Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.\n\n                               ERIN\n            And you were told to destroy those?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            That's right.\n\n     Destruction of evidence.  Pretty big deal.  Erin plays it\n     down.  Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.\n\n                               EMBRY\n            Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good\n            employee.\n\n                               ERIN\n            What do you mean?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            Well.  There were a few documents that I\n            somehow didn't get around to shredding.\n                        (beat)\n            That I kept instead.\n\n     Erin stops, mid-bite.\n\n     INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT\n\n     He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents.  Erin looks\n     them over, stunned.  Embry is standing apart from her, hands\n     shoved deep in his pockets.\n\n                               ERIN\n            How come you didn't say anything when you\n            found these things?\n\n                               EMBRY\n            At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some\n            of 'em want to go to college.  I can't\n            afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was\n            being honorable.\n                        (beat)\n            But there's nothing honorable in what I did.\n                        (beat)\n            Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.\n            Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY\n\n     Rosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping\n     themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her\n     arms and a whole lot of attitude.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Hey, Ros, where are they?\n\n                               ROSALIND\n            In the conference --\n\n     But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can\n     finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her\n     gait.  They watch her with interest.\n\n     INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY\n\n     The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated\n     slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,\n     Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.\n\n     Erin breezes in like sunshine.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Morning!\n\n                               ED\n            Erin?

And seeing\n            as how you've been so good to me, I think\n            that is a terrible oversight.  So what I\n            been doing over the last few days is I've\n            been putting together a present for you.\n\n     She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top\n     of the box.  Looks in.\n\n                               ERIN\n            635.  They all signed.  Every single one.\n\n     IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering\n     what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads\n     across Ed's face.\n\n                               ED\n            Ho - ly - shit.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a\n            little something for you, too.\n\n     Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Internal PG&E documents, all about the\n            contamination.  The one I like best says,\n            and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,\n            the water's poisonous, but it'd be better\n            for all involved if this matter wasn't\n            discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the\n            Hinkley station, from PG&E Headquarters.\n            Stamped received, March, 1966.\n\n     Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.\n\n                               POTTER\n            Where did -- how did you do this?\n\n                               ERIN\n            Well, what with me not having any brains or\n            legal expertise, I just went on up there and\n            performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in\n            five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.\n\n     And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.\n     The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.\n\n     EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY\n\n     Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads\n     down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors\n     open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.\n\n                               ED\n            Hey!\n\n     Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He\n     stares at her, in awe.\n\n                               ED\n            I don't know what to say.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Say you were wrong.\n\n                               ED\n            I was wrong.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged\n            yourself.\n\n                               ED\n            I did.  Both.\n\n                               ERIN\n            Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on\n            Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.\n\n                               ED\n            The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,\n            Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in\n            history.\n\n     He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in\n     the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the\n     elevator.\n\n                               ED\n            But I know you're not gonna quit on me.\n\n                               ERIN\n            How do you know that?\n\n                               ED\n                        (with a smile)\n            Cause you got a little voice in your head\n            saying, do the right thing.  Give him\n            another chance.\n\n     Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see\n     her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.\n\n                                                  DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     EXT.

ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY\n\n     Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little\n     different.  She's singing along with \"Funky Town.\"\n\n     EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n     Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a\n     little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is\n     slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the\n     water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.\n\n     EXT. BEACH - LATER\n\n     Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her\n     girls boogie board in.
