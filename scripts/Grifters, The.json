RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs\n\t(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains\n\tof New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler\n\tturns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking\n\tarea.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler\n\tat LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold\n\tand watchful.\n\t\n\tWIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets\n\tout, locks the car.

ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self\n\tindulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,\n\tpicks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around\n\tto open the trunk.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the\n\tsalesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals\n\tand product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,\n\tshuts the trunk, walks away.\n\t\n\tEXT. 6TH STREET - DAY\n\t\n\tRoy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he\n\tapproaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes\n\tcontracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from\n\tthe right.\n\t\n\tSCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.\n\t\n\tSCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.\n\t\n\tSCENE THREE:\n\t\n\tEXT.

At first glance, Myra looks\n\trather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,\n\tand usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)\n\t\n\tSIMULTANEOUSLY:\n\t\n\tSCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.\n\t\n\tSCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.\n\t\n\tSCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.\n\t\n\tWIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.\n\t\n\tINT. BAR - DAY\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a\n\tNOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the\n\tbar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's\n\tattention.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the\n\tbill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he\n\tSHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.\n\t\n\tBARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar\n\tbill.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as\n\tthe bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes\n\ta fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto\n\tthe bar, holding it there with one finger.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,\n\tnodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting\n\tthe beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,\n\thurrying away.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change\n\tdown, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.\n\t\n\tCU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes\n\tover it.\n\t\n\tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY\n\t\n\tWIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting\n\todds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.\n\t\n\tCLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.\n\t\n\tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a\n\tlarge heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as\n\tthough it were a file drawer.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track\n\tbeyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.\n\tLilly moves.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly\n\tapproaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.\n\t\n\tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY\n\t\n\tA change of numbers sweeps across the board.\n\t\n\tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n\t\n\tLilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting\n\ttickets into her bag.\n\t\n\tECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small\n\tenvelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly\n\tcarefully files the betting slips.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.\n\t\n\tEXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY\n\t\n\tCU, number 3. Odds 32-1.\n\t\n\tEXT.

TOTE BOARD - DAY\n\t\n\tCU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers\n\tshift: odds 26-1.\n\t\n\t                    CALLER (O.S.)\n\t          And they're off!\n\t\n\tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\t\n\tVery quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow\n\tticking clock.\n\tMyra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the\n\tJEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a\n\tjeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,\n\tshakes his head regretfully.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          Why? What's wrong?\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t              (personal emotion mixed\n\t               in)\n\t          You are a valued customer, as you\n\t          know.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          But what's wrong?\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          I can't understand a thing like\n\t          this. It's something you almost\n\t          never see.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          What is?\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t              (holding up bracelet)\n\t          This is some of the finest\n\t          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.\n\t          But the stones, no. They're not\n\t          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          But they must be! They cut glass!\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t              (wry)\n\t          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.\n\t          Do you know where it was purchased?\n\t\n\tINT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tAn expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the\n\twindows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged\n\ton the bed and laughs at COLE \"FARMER\" LANGLEY, 55, stringy\n\tbodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,\n\tpresenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden\n\tby his body as she lifts something that was hanging on\n\tsomething at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,\n\tlooks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward\n\tagain toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.\n\t\n\tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          It was a gift. It isn't worth\n\t          anything at all?\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t              (warm, encouraging)\n\t          Why, of course it is. I can offer\n\t          you -- well, five hundred dollars.\n\t\n\tMyra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,\n\ttense, but stuck. She nods.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          All right.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t              (rising)\n\t          I'll get you a check.\n\t\n\tHe leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.\n\t\n\tINT. SECOND BAR - DAY\n\t\n\tAnother crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves\n\tquickly, carrying a draft beer.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as\n\tthe bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the\n\tbill, stops, stares at the bill.\n\t\n\tTWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a\n\tvery cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries\n\tan innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.\n\t\n\tCU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender\n\tsimultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away\n\tand the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching\n\tunder the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off\n\tbaseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to\n\tprotect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of\n\tthe bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard\n\tinto Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and\n\tpropelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The\n\tnearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something\n\thappened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in\n\tconversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the\n\tbat away under the bar.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in\n\tshock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already\n\tbeen closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles\n\ttoward the door.\n\t\n\tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,\n\tswitching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away\n\tfrom the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly\n\tpasses by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves\n\ton along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.\n\t\n\tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY\n\t\n\tMyra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which\n\the hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          I hope you're not too badly\n\t          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          It's not your fault.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          You'll give us an opportunity to\n\t          serve you again, I hope. If there's\n\t          anything you think we might be\n\t          interested in...\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          I have only one thing now. Are you\n\t          interested?\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          Well, I'd have to see it, of\n\t          course.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          You are seeing it. You're looking\n\t          right at it.\n\t\n\tThe jeweler is puzzled, then startled.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          I see.\n\t\n\tHe turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at\n\tMyra.\n\t\n\t                    JEWELER\n\t          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A\n\t          bracelet like that very rarely\n\t          happens. A fine setting and\n\t          workmanship usually mean precious\n\t          stones. It always hurts me when I\n\t          find they're not. I always hope -- \n\t              (faint sad friendly smile)\n\t          -- I'm mistaken.\n\t\n\tMyra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her\n\tproblem. She rises.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA\n\t          Thank you. For everything you felt\n\t          you could do.\n\t\n\tEXT. STREET - DAY\n\t\n\tRoy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled\n\tlike a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still\n\tclutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP\n\tgets out. He's suspicious at first.\n\t\n\t                    COP\n\t          Sir? Everything all right?\n\t\n\tThe sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He\n\tstraightens, smiling through his pain.\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I\n\t          think.\n\t\n\tThe con's suspicion changes to concern.\n\t\n\t                    COP\n\t          Want us to take you to a doctor?\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,\n\t          anyway. Still got a lot of clients\n\t          to see.\n\t\n\t                    COP\n\t          Take it easy, now.\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t          Oh, I will.\n\t\n\tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n\t\n\tLate afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost\n\tall the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely\n\tseparated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to\n\tit from the track entrance.\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her\n\tbag inside.\n\t\n\tCLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from\n\ther bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different\n\tcompartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these\n\tseparated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She\n\ttakes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag\n\twith the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she\n\tlifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor\n\tpanel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds\n\ttoday's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her\n\tshoulder, closes the trunk.\n\t\n\tEXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY\n\t\n\tA shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall\n\tbalcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front\n\tapartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the\n\tbasement garage.\n\t\n\tINT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY\n\t\n\tModest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old\n\tbore, talks with a potential RENTER.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to\n\t          a woman, well, she has to have a\n\t          room with a bath. I insist on it,\n\t          because otherwise she's got the\n\t          hall bath tied up all the time,\n\t          washing her goddamn hair and her\n\t          clothes and everything she can\n\t          think of.\n\t\n\tIn b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves\n\tto Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,\n\tand crosses to the mailboxes.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          Now, your minimum for a room with\n\t          bath is three hundred a month, just\n\t          for a place to sleep and no cooking\n\t          allowed.\n\t          And just how many of these tootsies\n\t          make that kind of money and have to\n\t          eat in restaurants and buy clothes\n\t          and --\n\t\n\tRoy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,\n\tcrosses to Simms.\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t          Mr. Simms.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t              (fawning)\n\t          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a\n\t          potential new neighbor, looking at--\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t              (uninterested)\n\t          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.\n\t\n\tSimms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          I'll send her right up.\n\t\n\tRoy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          I had my first hotel thirty-seven\n\t          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,\n\t          and that's where I began to learn\n\t          about women. They just don't make\n\t          the money, you see, not regular\n\t          they don't, and there's only one\n\t          way they can get it.\n\t\n\tRoy enters the elevator.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's\n\t          the fine type of person I have in\n\t          mind for here. Like yourself, I\n\t          have no doubt. He's a salesman,\n\t          regular as clockwork, has a suite\n\t          here. Fine man. Now, about these\n\t          women. At first, you know, they\n\t          just go out and do it now and then,\n\t          just enough to make ends meet. But\n\t          pretty soon they got that bank open\n\t          twenty-four hours a day, and then\n\t          you've got trouble. Hookers and\n\t          hotellin' just don't mix.\n\t          You'd think the cops'd be too busy\n\t          catching real criminals, not\n\t          snooping around after working\n\t          girls, but that's the way the gravy\n\t          stains, as the saying is, and I\n\t          don't fight it. An ounce of\n\t          prevention is my motto.\n\t\n\tMyra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points\n\tupward. Simms calls to her.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up\n\t          there, he's expecting you.\n\t\n\tMyra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.\n\t\n\t                    SIMMS\n\t          If you keep out the women in the\n\t          first place, see, you keep out the\n\t          hookers, and then you keep out the\n\t          cops, and that's how you have a\n\t          clean place.\n\t\n\tEXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\t\n\tAN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.\n\tand Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it\n\twith her key, enters.\n\t\n\tINT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tA small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and\n\ttrousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the\n\tmirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He\n\ttouches his stomach, winces.\n\t\n\t                    MYRA (O.S.)\n\t          Roy?\n\t\n\tHe looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.\n\t\n\t                    ROY\n\t          Your medicine is here.\n\t\n\tHe leaves the bathroom.\n\t\n\tINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\t\n\tHotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,\n\tcontrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown\n\tpictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames.

She HISSES; she HISSES;\n\tshe HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.\n\t\n\tWIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,\n\tlike someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She\n\tblunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to\n\tpick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes\n\tback to her knees.\n\t\n\tLOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the\n\tmoney into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the\n\tcarpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her\n\tknees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.\n\t\n\tWIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.\n\tShe gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA\n\tHOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly\n\treappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up\n\tthe attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across\n\tthe threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO\n\tBLACK.\n\t\n\t                          THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrifters, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Donald E.
