Roy puts the\n\tbill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he\n\tSHOUTS his order.

A slow\n\tticking clock.\n\tMyra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the\n\tJEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a\n\tjeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,\n\tshakes his head regretfully.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    JEWELER\n</b>\t          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    MYRA\n</b>\t          Why?

HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAn expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the\n\twindows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged\n\ton the bed and laughs at COLE \"FARMER\" LANGLEY, 55, stringy\n\tbodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,\n\tpresenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden\n\tby his body as she lifts something that was hanging on\n\tsomething at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,\n\tlooks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward\n\tagain toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT.

Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT. SECOND BAR - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAnother crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves\n\tquickly, carrying a draft beer.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as\n\tthe bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the\n\tbill, stops, stares at the bill.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tTWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a\n\tvery cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries\n\tan innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tCU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender\n\tsimultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away\n\tand the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching\n\tunder the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off\n\tbaseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to\n\tprotect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of\n\tthe bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard\n\tinto Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and\n\tpropelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The\n\tnearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something\n\thappened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in\n\tconversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the\n\tbat away under the bar.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in\n\tshock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already\n\tbeen closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles\n\ttoward the door.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tEXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tAN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,\n\tswitching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away\n\tfrom the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly\n\tpasses by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves\n\ton along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tMyra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which\n\the hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    JEWELER\n</b>\t          I hope you're not too badly\n\t          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    MYRA\n</b>\t          It's not your fault.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    JEWELER\n</b>\t          You'll give us an opportunity to\n\t          serve you again, I hope.

A\n\t          bracelet like that very rarely\n\t          happens. A fine setting and\n\t          workmanship usually mean precious\n\t          stones. It always hurts me when I\n\t          find they're not. I always hope -- \n\t              (faint sad friendly smile)\n\t          -- I'm mistaken.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tMyra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her\n\tproblem.

STREET - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tRoy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled\n\tlike a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still\n\tclutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP\n\tgets out. He's suspicious at first.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    COP\n</b>\t          Sir? Everything all right?\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear.

A bad shrimp, I\n\t          think.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tThe con's suspicion changes to concern.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    COP\n</b>\t          Want us to take you to a doctor?\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    ROY\n</b>\t          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,\n\t          anyway.

RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tLate afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost\n\tall the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely\n\tseparated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to\n\tit from the track entrance.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tAN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her\n\tbag inside.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tCLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from\n\ther bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different\n\tcompartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these\n\tseparated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She\n\ttakes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag\n\twith the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she\n\tlifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor\n\tpanel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds\n\ttoday's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her\n\tshoulder, closes the trunk.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tEXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tA shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall\n\tbalcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front\n\tapartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the\n\tbasement garage.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\tINT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tModest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old\n\tbore, talks with a potential RENTER.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    SIMMS\n</b>\t          Put it this way, now.

I insist on it,\n\t          because otherwise she's got the\n\t          hall bath tied up all the time,\n\t          washing her goddamn hair and her\n\t          clothes and everything she can\n\t          think of.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tIn b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves\n\tto Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,\n\tand crosses to the mailboxes.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    SIMMS\n</b>\t          Now, your minimum for a room with\n\t          bath is three hundred a month, just\n\t          for a place to sleep and no cooking\n\t          allowed.\n\t          And just how many of these tootsies\n\t          make that kind of money and have to\n\t          eat in restaurants and buy clothes\n\t          and --\n<b>\t\n</b>\tRoy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,\n\tcrosses to Simms.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    ROY\n</b>\t          Mr. Simms.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    SIMMS\n</b>\t              (fawning)\n\t          Why yes, Mr. Dillon.

They just don't make\n\t          the money, you see, not regular\n\t          they don't, and there's only one\n\t          way they can get it.\n<b>\t\n</b>\tRoy enters the elevator.\n<b>\t\n</b><b>\t                    SIMMS\n</b>\t          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's\n\t          the fine type of person I have in\n\t          mind for here.

At first, you know, they\n\t          just go out and do it now and then,\n\t          just enough to make ends meet. But\n\t          pretty soon they got that bank open\n\t          twenty-four hours a day, and then\n\t          you've got trouble.

Roy, lifting the glass to drink,\n\tturns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the\n\tattache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes\n\tinto the glass and into his face.

His eyes dull.\n\tLilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't\n\tdare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she\n\tHISSES her agony through her teeth.

Lilly's weeping subsides.\n\tShe gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA\n\tHOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly\n\treappears. She does not again look toward Roy.
