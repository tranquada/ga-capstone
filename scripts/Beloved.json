A house sits isolated beside a barren\n     field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant\n     woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown\n     STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch\n     with a single door serves as the only entrance.\n\n     Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;\n\n<b>     SUPER - OHIO, 1865\n</b>\n     WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING\n     OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards.\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN.\n</b>\n<b>     C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY\n</b><b>     RUN DOWN THE STAIRS..\n</b>\n     BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the\n     steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying\n     a small bag of belongings.\n\n<b>                         HOWARD\n</b>               We gonna need food. Wait here.\n\n     Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter\n     runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front\n     door, when suddenly;\n\n     THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps\n     away slowly.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - DAWN.\n</b>\n     Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A\n     CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces\n     already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table.\n\n     He is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND\n     PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold -\n     dropping the knife.\n\n<b>     INT.

They love\n     their sister. But there are stronger forces here.\n\n     A MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle.\n\n<b>                         HOWARD\n</b>               We gotta go!\n\n     Bulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep\n     affection and pained longing. He wants to take her.\n\n<b>                         HOWARD\n</b>               Bye, Denver. You take care.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Bye? Bul?\n\n     Bulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs\n     his sister.

She sadly looks\n     up and weeps, as if to the house itself:\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Now what you go and do that for?\n\n<b>     EXT. ROAD TO THE TRAIN - DAWN.\n</b>\n     THE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images\n     of:\n\n     The two boys running for their lives towards the train,\n     holding hands all the way.  Howard is the first to reach it.\n     As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in.\n     Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him.\n\n     C.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect.\n\n     WIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town.\n\n     On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD.\n\n     CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A\n     HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone\n     is only one word:\n\n<b>     BELOVED.\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.\n</b>\n     Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a\n     Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom\n     window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She\n     hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding\n     of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is\n     too constant to notice.\n\n<b>                                                          FADE OUT;\n</b>\n<b>     FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>     INT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY.\n</b>\n     BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in\n     her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the\n     only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is\n     bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of\n     suffering and sacrifice and tested faith.\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS\n</b>               Ya know what I'd love to see? I loved to\n               see me some lavender. You got any\n               lavender? Or even pink - pink'll do.\n\n     Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and\n     checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around\n     the room..\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               No. Sorry.\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS\n</b>               Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if\n               you've got an appetite for color.\n\n     Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until;\n\n<b>                         SETHE (OS)\n</b>               Oh wait...\n\n     Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at\n     her. Suggs smiles.\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS\n</b>               Oh, that's fine. Fine.\n\n     Sethe lets out a small laugh. She walks toward the window,\n     stretching her body. Her expression changes as she thinks of\n     her boys. Baby Suggs reads her like a book.\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS\n</b>               They'll be all right. I'm surprised they\n               lasted here this long.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS\n</b>               What'd be the point? Not a house in the\n               country ain't packed to the rafters with\n               some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our\n               ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come\n               back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You\n               lucky. You got one child left, still\n               pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had\n               eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one\n               of them gone from me. Four taken, four\n               chased and all, I expect, worrying\n               somebody's house into evil. My first born\n               - alls I can remember of her now is how\n               she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her\n               little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they\n               slapped me. Can you beat that?

Almost twenty years...\n               My two girls, sold and gone before I\n               could even a heard about it, and them\n               without their grown up teeth yet. My\n               third child, my son after Halle...I let\n               that straw boss have me for four months\n               so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he\n               had him traded for lumber anyway and me\n               pregnant with his child. I couldn't love\n               that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the\n               rest either.

I learned hard that a man's\n               just a man, but a son like that...like\n               Halle..now that's somebody.\n\n     Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. Although she\n     loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Just got a few more things to do, then\n               I'll start supper.\n\n     Sethe exits.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     Denver is playing in the front yard by herself.\n\n     Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A\n     gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it\n     floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.\n\n     C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the\n     feeling a memory - from long ago.\n\n     Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in\n     the barren field of 124...but rather-\n\n<b>     MEMORY;\n</b>\n<b>     EXT. SWEET HOME - LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating\n     down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as\n     the eye can see. Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic\n     landscape.\n\n     Sethe looks frightened. Her breathing grows shallow. She\n     hears something;\n\n     THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing\n     louder, coming towards her\n\n<b>                                                          INTERCUT;\n</b>\n<b>     C.U.

He wears no hat.\n\n     Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of\n     124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's\n     sycamores have vanished.\n\n     Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,\n     Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so\n     as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at\n     Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.\n\n     The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She\n     watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her\n     mother watching her.\n\n     Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to\n     ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.\n\n     Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods.\n\n<b>     EXT. WOODS - LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is\n     going.\n\n     She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall\n     bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,\n     forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,\n     with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.\n\n     This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls\n     through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely\n     child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself\n     together. She lays her face against the cool earth.\n\n<b>     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver walks to her room in her night dress.

His feet sore and \n     blistering in his shoes.\n\n<b>     EXT. THE PUMP - DAY.\n</b>\n     Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs\n     at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking\n     towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make\n     out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he\n     reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view.\n\n     Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is\n     little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not\n     certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Paul?

The rest\n               is you.\n\n     Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says\n     this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may\n     have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs:\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               The truth be known, I go anywhere these\n               days.

I just hope\n               you'll pardon my house.\n\n     Paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've \n     survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her\n     home.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               My house. I like the sound of that.\n\n     Sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in.\n\n<b>     INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.\n</b>\n     Sethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her,\n     hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. As he\n     follows her in;\n\n     A POOL OF RED, UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him. It worries\n     him.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               You got company?\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               On and off.\n\n     The light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way\n     to the kitchen at the end of the hall. Frightened, Paul steps\n     back out the door.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Good God!

Just step through.\n\n     Sethe reaches out her hand. Paul tentatively takes it and is\n     lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the\n     kitchen where it ends.\n\n     As he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light.\n     It is sad. A sadness that touches him, welling up inside\n     until tears are brimming in his eyes. He reaches the normal\n     light of the kitchen and steps out of it.\n\n<b>     INT.

The one I was carrying when I\n               left Sweet Home is all I got left.\n\n     Still affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the\n     table, finding something to say.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Well, probably best..If a Negro boy got\n               legs he ought to use them.

He watches as Sethe\n     ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to\n     quiet her down.\n\n     Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out a\n     pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for\n     smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Sethe\n     to return.\n\n     When she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spits on\n     her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then begins\n     to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to\n     Paul throughout - as the scene continues;\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               What tree, Sethe?\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Huh?\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               What tree on your back?

As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her.\n     He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his\n     cheek against her back.. He rubs his cheek against it,\n     feeling the scars beneath the dress. Raising his fingers to\n     the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which\n     slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has\n     become.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Aw Lord, girl.\n\n     Grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility\n     for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every\n     ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. The tenderness is\n     almost unbearable.\n\n     Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING. He pauses and looks\n     down...He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but\n     rather;\n\n<b>     THE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING, GRINDING, SHOVING\n</b>     the house from side to side.\n\n     Sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress.\n\n     On all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if\n     trying to keep the house together.\n\n     Paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout;\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               GOD DAMN IT! HUSH UP! Leave this place\n               alone! Get the hell outta here!\n\n     A table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg. Managing to\n     stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds\n     the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking\n     everything, screaming at the house;\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b><b>               YOU WANT TO FIGHT, COME ON!

He leans against the wall, panting.\n\n     Sethe is crouched by the stove. A mixed expression of relief\n     and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient\n     child has been sent away. But a child she loves nonetheless.\n\n     Denver looks frightened. More alone than ever, now that her\n     one companion is gone.\n\n     All three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like\n     one tired person.\n\n<b>                                                      LAP DISSOLVE:\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it.\n\n     And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and\n     the fear they feel takes it's place.\n\n     Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the\n     floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to\n     kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn\n     victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their\n     touch.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.\n</b>\n     Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably\n     eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate.\n\n<b>     INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER.\n</b>\n     Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still\n     fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly.\n     Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or\n     excitement - but sits like a chasm between them.\n\n     As Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS:\n\n<b>     MEMORY:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

Then continues\n     forward, as if with a specific direction in mind.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON.\n</b>\n     Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to\n     see.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Look. What is that?\n\n     All three look to see;\n\n     THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the\n     steps of 124.\n\n     As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and\n     stares directly at Sethe.\n\n     The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe,\n     curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a\n     hunger in her stare.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER.\n</b>\n     The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup\n     of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               You from around here?\n\n     The Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and\n     takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends\n     down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes\n     leave Sethe.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Those shoes look brand new.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               What might your name be?\n\n     The Young Woman speaks in a low, rough voice;\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               Beloved.\n\n     Sethe drops the shoes.

They're not walking\n               feet. More like she rode from somewhere\n               all the way here.\n\n     Yet, Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her\n     to the white staircase. Beloved starts coughing.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Sounds like the croup.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Is she feverish, Denver?\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               No. She's cold.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Then she is. Fever goes from hot to cold.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Could have the cholera.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>                    (adamant)\n               She's not sick!\n\n     Denver helps her up the stairs. Sethe and Paul register\n     Denver's defensive reaction.\n\n<b>     INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - SAME TIME.\n</b>\n     Denver eases Beloved into the bed. Beloved falls asleep the\n     second she hits the pillow. Denver gently - cautiously -\n     strokes Beloved's forehead and cheek.\n\n<b>     INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver stands vigil beside Beloved, wrapped beneath a quilt.\n\n<b>     INT.

BABY'S SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver washes out Beloved's underwear and stockings...She\n     hears Beloved murmuring. She moves quickly to her side.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Beloved? Beloved I'm here...what is it?\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               Heavy..this place is heavy.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Would you like to sit up?\n\n     Beloved shakes her head no. She takes hold of Denver's arm\n     and wraps it around her own body. Denver sits up against the\n     pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denver's arms and\n     falls back asleep. Denver holds her, lovingly.\n\n<b>     INT. BABY SUGGS ROOM - DAYS LATER.\n</b>\n     Denver has not left her bedside. She places another quilt\n     upon her, tucking it in around the sides. As she does this,\n     Beloved's eyes open for a brief moment, catching the sight of\n     Denver over her. She smiles. Denver gratefully smiles back.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Can I get you anything? Are you hungry?\n\n     Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food -\n     Denver's meal. Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and\n     feeds her. Denver is thrilled.\n\n<b>     THE FOLLOWING SCENES TAKE PLACE OVER SEVERAL WEEKS;\n</b>\n<b>     INT.

Denver drinks in the attention, her\n     heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange\n     creature.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               ..and....and Bulgar...At night, we used\n               to..crawl into bed together..I'd lay down\n               on Bul's lap and Howard would tell us die-\n               witch stories.

It makes Denver laugh,\n     as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see\n     them both happy.\n\n     It makes Paul disgusted.\n\n<b>     INT.

COLD ROOM - A WINTER NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Paul D. is wide awake. The memories won't let him sleep.\n\n     Winter has arrived and the night is cold. He lies underneath\n     a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place, even further\n     from the house. He adds newspapers under and around his body\n     to stay warm.\n\n     He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether. He\n     hears the door to the cold room open. But he does not turn to\n     look.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               What do you want in here?\n\n     Beloved enters the cold room.\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               I want you to touch me on the inside part\n               and call me my name.\n\n     She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away..

COLD HOUSE - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the\n     sounds of lovemaking. And cries.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Sethe, Denver, Paul and Beloved eat dinner...in silence.\n\n<b>     INT. COLD HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on\n     his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished. Beloved\n     gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even \n     friendliness. Just a cold look, void of respect or even\n     attraction.\n\n     She exits the cold house, leaving Paul alone. He is on the\n     verge of tears.\n\n<b>     INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him\n     mad. He wants to touch her, to wake her, to ask for\n     forgiveness and help. But he can not and buries his head in\n     his hands.\n\n<b>     EXT. SAWYER RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON.\n</b>\n     Paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and\n     breathing inside to keep them warm. He is rehearsing:\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Look here Sethe..You ain't gonna like\n               what I got to say but I got to say\n               it...See, it's not the..a man\n               can't...what I mean is, it ain't really\n               me..see, it ain't weakness, the kind of\n               weakness I can fight, that girl is doing\n               it. I know you think I never liked her\n               nohow, still don't, but she is doing it\n               to me anyway. Fixing me, Sethe, she's\n               fixed me and I can't break it...\n\n     Sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a\n     scrap pan in the crook of her arm. To her surprise. she finds\n     Paul waiting for her.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Man, you make me feel like a young girl,\n               you coming by to pick me up after work.\n               Nobody ever did that before. Better watch\n               out, I might start looking forward to it.\n\n     She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap\n     before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Got to rinse this out.\n\n     She enters the restaurant. Paul watches the dogs eat -\n     watching them getting what they wanted. Sethe re-appears with\n     a cloth over her head.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               You get off early or what?\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               I took off early.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Anything the matter?\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               In a way of speaking.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Not cut back?\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               No, no.

There\n     is no apprehension or anger in her look. Instead, a calm\n     resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he\n     had to tell her without it being anyone's fault. As if she\n     already knew he cane to say he was leaving her. She smiles.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Well say it, Paul D...whether I like it\n               or not.\n\n     Paul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her\n     diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her\n     eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with\n     respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops\n     into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned;\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               I want you pregnant, Sethe. Would you do\n               that for me?\n\n     Sethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               You came by here to ask me that!? You are\n               one crazy-headed man. You right; I don't\n               like it!...Don't you think I'm a little\n               too old to start that all over again?\n\n     She slips her fingers into his.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Think about it.\n\n     Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his\n     cheek. He smiles broadly;\n\n     She laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a\n     gift, so suddenly. They begin walking.\n\n     Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers,\n     stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his\n     arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his\n     chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not\n     breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees\n     lining the roadside like defending arms against attack.\n     Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes:\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Mercy.\n\n<b>     EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING.\n</b>\n     On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand.\n     Snow falling all around them.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               I been on my feet all day, Paul D.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Where I been?

Need\n               a willing partner though.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               I'll say..Very, very willing.\n\n     They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when\n     they are jolted by the appearance of;\n\n     Beloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands\n     wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her\n     eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence.\n\n     Sethe gets herself down from Paul.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Crazy girl. You out here with nothing on.\n\n     She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around\n     her shoulders.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               You got to learn more sense than that.\n\n     She walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and\n     filled with anger, walks behind.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Evening, girl.\n\n     Sethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he\n     stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as\n     if to ask - \"Who's ally are you?\"...Denver, unnerved by his\n     look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a\n     moment later, Sethe re-appears.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Now I know you not sleeping out there\n               tonight, are you Paul D.?\n                    (Paul doesn't reply)\n               You come upstairs tonight. Where you\n               belong...and stay there.\n\n     As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Denver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry,\n     upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth.\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               She likes him here...\n                    (to Denver)\n               Make him go away.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               She'd be mad if he leaves.\n\n     Beloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in\n     her mouth as if something were bothering her...until,\n     finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly\n     bloody.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               OOoo..didn't that hurt you?\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               It's like my dreams...I get two dreams,\n               see..One, I exploding...BUUOOGGG...The\n               other I being swallowed.

SETHE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the\n     ceiling. Paul is asleep.\n\n     On her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the\n     window to look out.\n\n     At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of\n     the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by\n     without Sethe noticing her.\n\n     Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall.\n     Then, as she moves back to the bed,...\n\n     Camera moves ahead of her to:\n\n<b>     A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP.

The two women struggle\n     as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes\n     Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her\n     with a bloody breast..\n\n     Baby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from\n     outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock.\n\n     A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of\n     shoes and hands them to her..\n\n<b>                         WHITE BOY\n</b>               Mama says Wednesday.

Sethe speaks to Denver;\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Go get the shawls..and find me an old\n               shoe for that half a pair...\n\n     The girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the\n     pail.\n\n<b>     EXT. A FROZEN CREEK - DAY.\n</b>\n     A bright, cold winter day. Beloved wears a pair of old\n     skates. Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate\n     and one shoe..The two girls giggle and fall as they try to\n     skate on the ice... helping each other up. Their skirts \n     whirling...their laughter mingled with screams of delight.\n\n     Sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Come on, ma'am...try!\n\n     Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly\n     falls on her rear. The girls scream with laughter. Sethe\n     tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as\n     well. The girls try to help her and fall over each other in\n     the trying.\n\n     Denver rises and tries an independent glide. The tip of her\n     skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly.\n     All three laugh so hard, they start coughing. Beloved goes to\n     Denver's aid.\n\n     Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking\n     her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.\n\n     Beloved helps Denver, and falls as well. The two girls see\n     Sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times...\n\n     Until, Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop\n     and look.\n\n     The two glide back to Sethe. Her laughter has stopped, but\n     her tears have not... They gently, comfortingly, touch her\n     shoulder.\n\n<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.\n</b>\n     It is a snowy night outside the windows.\n\n     Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire\n     in the stove. She has made sweet milk that she hands to the\n     girls before taking her place in between them, on the floor,\n     facing the fire; Denver, on her right, rests her head on her\n     lap. Beloved sits on her left.\n\n     She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire. The\n     illumination highlights her beauty and her profile; the chin,\n     mouth, forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow\n     the fire threw on the wall. Sethe can't help but stare as\n     another thought occurs to her;\n\n<b>                         BABY SUGGS (V.O.)\n</b>               ...All I remember is how she loved the\n               bottom of burned bread.

In the flickering\n     of the firelight, Sethe can see:\n\n<b>     A SMILE OF A SCAR BENEATH HER CHIN.\n</b>\n     Sethe knows before she's aware of it consciously. And just as\n     it hits her, BELOVED BEGINS TO HUM A MELODY.\n\n     Sethe recognizes it as her own melody.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               I made that song up. I made it up and\n               sang it to my children...\n\n     Denver lifts her head from her mother's lap to look at Sethe,\n     knowing what is happening....\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               ...Nobody knows that song but me and my\n               children.\n\n     Beloved turns to Sethe;\n\n<b>                         BELOVED\n</b>               I know it.\n\n     A click. Sethe looks at her daughter, returned. \"There is no\n     gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous.

Last time I saw Halle, with\n               that butter all over his face and me with\n               an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister -\n               sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like\n               king on a throne. He was a hateful thing.\n               Bloody and evil..But he was better than\n               me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay\n               what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd\n               be cooking a rooster named Mister.

And it strikes me, it's got to be\n               cause we were something else.

Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED\n     YELL. Her face registers fear.

She\n     hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman.\n\n<b>                         SETHE\n</b>               Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's\n               going be doing that..nobody going be\n               writing my daughter's characteristics on\n               the animal side..no sir..I don't\n               care..ain't laying that down..no sir.

She rises cautiously, then sits at the\n     table. Denver rises and gets her some food, placing it before\n     her.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Please mama, eat something...\n\n     Sethe nods...Denver is getting more and more frightened of\n     losing her mother completely...Instead of protecting Beloved\n     from Sethe, she must protect her mother from Beloved.\n\n<b>     EXT.

I know the rage Sethe felt\n               in that shed that day.  We all do. But\n               what I could not understand, and still\n               don't, was her reaction to it. Prideful.\n               Too damn complicated for a black woman in\n               her position before God. But whatever she\n               done, I don't like the idea of past\n               errors taking possession of the present.\n               I don't cotton to sin moving in on a\n               house, unleashed and sassy. Every day\n               life takes enough, takes all a woman has.\n               \"Sufficient unto the day is evil thereof\"\n               and nobody needs more. Nobody needs a\n               grown up evil sitting at a table with a\n               grudge. As long as that ghost showed\n               itself from a ghostly place, I respected\n               it. But once it take on flesh and come\n               into this world, well, the shoe's on the\n               other foot now. I don't mind a little\n               communication between worlds. But this\n               here's an invasion.\n\n     The women agree.\n\n<b>                         GRACE\n</b>               Should we pray?\n\n<b>                         ELLA\n</b>               Uh-huh. First. Then we got to get down to\n               business.\n\n<b>     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD.: KITCHEN - DAYS LATER.\n</b>\n     Denver comes down the stairs, entering the kitchen.\n\n     Sethe, worn out, looking more beaten and ravaged than before,\n     stands at the sink with an ICE PICK chopping up ice. Denver\n     speaks to her, but she does not turn or acknowledge her.\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               Mama?....Mama I'm going out..\n                    (no response)\n               Mama, I got a job.

I'll be staying there nights and\n               coming back here for the daytime. We'll\n               have some money, mama..Mama?\n\n     Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver\n     approaches her from behind and whispers softly;\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               I'm going help you, mama. Don't you give\n               up yet.\n\n     Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and\n     feels nothing. Denver exits.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY.\n</b>\n     Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when\n     she hears;\n\n     THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd.\n     towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG;\n\n     Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position\n     themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles,\n     crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they\n     could find.\n\n<b>     INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY.\n</b>\n     Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth\n     filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing.\n\n     Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see.\n\n<b>     EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.\n</b>\n     The women continue singing.\n\n<b>                                                            CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

Beloved is smiling brightly\n     at the beautiful singing.\n\n     Denver looks to her mother;\n\n     Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound\n     of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks\n     to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed\n     although up until this moment was not conscious of missing.\n\n     Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees:\n\n<b>     MR.

Figure between that and my night\n               work at the Bodwins I might be able to\n               put something away for me and mama.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               They treating you right over at the\n               Bodwins?\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she\n               teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I\n               might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting\n               on me.\n\n     Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil\n     the possibilities that lay before her.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               Your mother all right?\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               No. Not a bit all right.

Ella\n               thinks she might be waiting in the woods\n               for another chance but..I don't think so.\n               Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she\n               can feel it.\n\n<b>                         PAUL\n</b>               You think she sure 'nough your sister?\n\n<b>                         DENVER\n</b>               At times.
