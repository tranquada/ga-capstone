Rolls\r\n    the WINDOWS up, down, up. Tries futilely to untwist the\r\n    seatbelt, then LUNGES forward, locking it up. Rifles through\r\n    a tourist booklet and tears out a HAUNTED SEGWAY TOUR coupon.\r\n    The CABBIE, young, thin, brown, glances back and forth from\r\n    the rear view to the road to the rear view.\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL\r\n                Kinda lonesome back here.\r\n\r\n    CUT TO: DEADPOOL, WEDGING himself through the opening\r\n    between the back seat and front. His two katanas don't\r\n    cooperate, catching on the Plexiglas, stalling him mid-torso.\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                Little help?\r\n\r\n    The cabbie grabs Deadpool's hand and pulls him through to the\r\n    front. Deadpool's head rests upside down on the bench seat\r\n    as he maneuvers his legs through. The cabbie turns the\r\n    helping hand into a HANDSHAKE, then turns down the Juice.\r\n\r\n                            CABBIE\r\n                Dopinder.\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL\r\n                    (still upside-down)\r\n                Pool.

He\r\n    is YOKED to the gills and ARMED to the teeth. TWIN KATANAS.\r\n    TWIN DESERT EAGLE .50 CALIBER PISTOLS.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool grabs Dopinder's OPEN BAG of CORN NUTS. Dopinder\r\n    isn't quick enough to stop him. Deadpool gazes out the\r\n    window onto the city - a teeming, sooty urban sprawl that\r\n    looks almost... pre-post-apocalyptic.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool turns up his MASK. Dopinder catches a GLIMPSE of\r\n    the bottom of a SCARRED face. And quickly looks AWAY.\r\n    Deadpool eats the CORN NUTS. CRUNCH. CRUNCH.

She\r\n                 was supposed to make me a very agreeable\r\n                 wife. Mom and Dad chose her rather\r\n                 excellently. But Gita's heart has been\r\n                 stolen by my cousin Bandhu. Bandhu is as\r\n                 dishonorable as he is attractive.\r\n\r\n                           DEADPOOL\r\n                 Dopinder, I'm starting to think I'm in\r\n                 this cab for a reason.\r\n\r\n                           DOPINDER\r\n                 Because you hailed it?\r\n\r\n                           DEADPOOL\r\n                 No, my slender brown friend... to give\r\n                 you one crucial piece of advice: Love...\r\n                 is a beautiful thing. When it finds you,\r\n                 the whole world smells like Daffodil\r\n                 Daydream.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool's own heartbreak is palpable.        He takes another\r\n    deep, cleansing BREATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                     3.\r\n                 Deadpool    Final Shooting Script   11/16/15\r\n1   CONTINUED: (2)                                                        1\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                So hold onto love tight. Go at Bandhu\r\n                hard. Get Gita back. Or else... the\r\n                whole world will taste like Mama June\r\n                after hot yoga.\r\n\r\n                          DOPINDER\r\n                And how does Ms. Mama June taste?\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL\r\n                Like two hobos making love under a\r\n                drizzle of Limburger- I could go all day\r\n                like this. Point is, bad.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool chucks the bag of Corn Nuts into the back seat and\r\n    pulls out his PISTOLS. He starts CHAMBERING shells into two\r\n    magazines.\r\n\r\n    Suddenly, he frantically pats himself down, like a Hollywood\r\n    agent who can't find his phone.\r\n\r\n                          DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                Shiiiit.

The guy's\r\n    HEAD and SHOULDERS SMACK pavement, where he's DRAGGED\r\n    mercilessly by his ANKLE - a modern COWBOY whose boot just\r\n    got stuck in his horse's STIRRUP.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool grabs the driver by the HAIR on the BACK of his HEAD\r\n    and BANGS his FOREHEAD into:\r\n\r\n    The horn.

One more SMACK to get us back to\r\n    MARIACHI.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool looks in the REAR VIEW MIRROR to see the man in back\r\n    CRAWL up the tailgate.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool PUSHES in the Cadillac's CIGARETTE LIGHTER.\r\n\r\n    Back to the DRIVER. Deadpool BASHES his face into the\r\n    DRIVER's SIDE WINDOW. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP.\r\n\r\n    We're now OUTSIDE the Escalade, seeing the driver's\r\n    expression take on a ridiculous silly-putty-esque grimace of\r\n    pain every time it's MUSHED into the glass.\r\n\r\n    The man in back scrambles forward. The CIGARETTE LIGHTER\r\n    POPS OUT. Deadpool YANKS the EMERGENCY BRAKE. The man in\r\n    back LAUNCHES forward and SMACKS the DASHBOARD.\r\n\r\n    Deadpool STABS the now ORANGE-HOT lighter into the man's\r\n    forehead, burning the COIL PATTERN into his skin.

A MOTORCYCLE has pulled\r\n      AHEAD of the ESCALADE and now sits, STOPPED, in its path.\r\n\r\n      The helmeted RIDER OPENS FIRE with a SUB-MACHINE GUN.\r\n\r\n      Deadpool has one hand grasped on the back of the driver's\r\n      neck, still mashing his face into the window glass, and the\r\n      OTHER hand still clamped over the second man's mouth. He\r\n      plants both FEET on the steering wheel and `drives,' spinning\r\n      the wheel, sending the S.U.V. into...\r\n\r\n      ...a ROLL.    The Escalade goes ENDO, SOMERSAULTING WILDLY.\r\n\r\n      Suddenly, the ACTION BEGINS TO SLOW...\r\n\r\n      The motorcycle RIDER tries to bail out. NO LUCK. The\r\n      tumbling Escalade PLOWS RIGHT INTO him AND his bike.\r\n\r\n      Parts scatter off the motorcycle, including its CHAIN. The\r\n      RIDER continues to SQUEEZE off ROUNDS as he goes FLYING.\r\n\r\n      Inside the Escalade, Deadpool goes SPIN-CYCLE. The DRIVER\r\n      flies through the sunroof, tearing out its remaining glass.\r\n      BLOOD spatters. The other man spits out the glowing\r\n      CIGARETTE LIGHTER. The guy whose ankle is still tangled in\r\n      the seat-belt FLAILS through the air like a rag-doll, AHAB\r\n      tied to MOBY DICK.\r\n\r\n      The action CONTINUES to SLOW... until it FREEZES.\r\n\r\n      The camera swoops in to Deadpool's face, upside down.\r\n\r\n      HE TURNS HIS HEAD TO CAMERA FOR THE FIRST TIME, BREAKING THE\r\n      FOURTH WALL, THE ONLY THING IN THE SCENE THAT'S MOVING:\r\n\r\n                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                   Shit.

He FLIES high\r\n      toward a big HIGHWAY EXIT SIGN and... SPLAT... out of frame.\r\n\r\n      The RIDER's NECK is SLICED by the flying MOTORCYCLE CHAIN.\r\n\r\n      The DRIVER is half-way out the SUNROOF when the S.U.V. rolls\r\n      over him. SQUISH.\r\n\r\n      The man who ate the CIGARETTE LIGHTER now eats pavement.\r\n\r\nVX8   EXT.

Wade\r\n     smiles... angles his foot UNDER the OPERATING TABLE...\r\n\r\n     ...and uses it to SLIDE something out from underneath the\r\n     table: a BUCKET of BLOODY CHICKEN GIZZARDS that double as\r\n     removed `tumors.' Wade's RAGE seems to grow by the INSTANT.\r\n\r\n                            WADE\r\n                  Long enough...\r\n\r\n     Delgado senses he is suddenly in danger, picks up a rusty\r\n     SCALPEL from his tray. Wade moves toward him. Delgado\r\n     LUNGES, He STABS WADE in the shoulder, then RUNS.\r\n\r\n     Wade TACKLES him. In Wade's weakened state, the fight\r\n     becomes an intense STRUGGLE. The two FALL and WRESTLE. The\r\n     BUCKET of GIZZARDS overturns. They roll around in slop.\r\n\r\n     The doctor squirms out of Wade's grasp and crawls into the\r\n     hallway. Wade wriggles after him, tugging at his ankle.\r\n\r\n26   INT.   WAITING ROOM / HALLWAY - SUNSET - PAST                          26\r\n\r\n     The MUZAC still plays.

His expression is that of a\r\n     man who's LOSING his SHIT.\r\n\r\n     Wade RAISES THE SCALPEL, SLASHES at the doctor's throat, then\r\n     STABS him in the heart. The doctor writhes, spasms, gurgles,\r\n     and falls still.\r\n\r\n     Chest heaving, Wade raises his head to see... at the FAR END\r\n     of the HALL:\r\n\r\n     VANESSA - frozen, TERRIFIED. A blood-soaked Wade locks eyes\r\n     with her and swims back up into SANITY... `What have I done?'\r\n     This is a horrific glimpse into Wade's murderous past...\r\n\r\n     ...and the look on Vanessa's face is one of HORROR and PAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                      48.\r\n                   Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15\r\n27   CONTINUED:                                                             27\r\n\r\n     Awash in shame, Wade staggers to his feet, slips on chicken\r\n     blood, and LUNGES in the other direction.

He's being wheeled\r\n     down a dim corridor by two tough-looking ORDERLIES.\r\n\r\n     In one hand, he holds the recruiter's crumpled BUSINESS CARD.\r\n     In the other, he clutches the limited edition VOLTRON RING,\r\n     as tight as his shaky hand allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                 (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                        49.\r\n                   Deadpool     Final Shooting Script   11/16/15\r\n31   CONTINUED:                                                               31\r\n\r\n     They turn a corner and push through a pair of double doors\r\n     into a cavernous room. Wade looks around, full of hope for a\r\n     new life. Immediately, every single thing he sees/hears\r\n     begins to erode his confidence. The RECRUITER stands just\r\n     inside the doors, smiling.\r\n\r\n                            RECRUITER (O.S.)\r\n                  Mr. Wilson!

Wade's eyes\r\n     DART to helpless SILHOUETTES.\r\n\r\n     We hear WHISPERS, WHIMPERS, MOANS.\r\n\r\n     A FELLOW PATIENT, a pathetic, terrified little man named\r\n     CUNNINGHAM, is wheeled past Wade, restrained on another\r\n     STRETCHER. Cunningham briefly locks eyes with Wade, but\r\n     quickly moves on by.\r\n\r\n     Wade can't help but be alarmed by the TERROR in Cunningham's\r\n     eyes.\r\n\r\n     The tents are illuminated by BLINDING overhead lights.             Wade\r\n     spies GRUESOMELY INTIMIDATING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\n     Wade is wheeled into the tent that's his new home. The\r\n     FIGURE who was pushing Wade DUMPS him onto a CHROME OPERATING\r\n     TABLE and roughly STRAPS him down.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                                   50.\r\n                Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15\r\n31   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      31\r\n\r\n                         WADE\r\n               Um.

A warmer table.\r\n                   (shivers)\r\n               And warmer hands.\r\n\r\n     Wade DOUBLE-TAKES at the sight of the figure above him:\r\n     ANGEL DUST - thirties, female, tall, sexy, athletic - an\r\n     Amazonian warrior in another age.\r\n\r\n     Angel Dust wheels over a high-tech I.V. DRIP, complete with\r\n     glass cylindrical tanks housing a glowing, viscous LIQUID.\r\n\r\n     Then she roughly straps Wade's NECK to the table. Wade\r\n     nearly GASPS, the color now officially drained from his face.\r\n\r\n                          WADE (CONT'D)\r\n               Easy!

Dim\r\n       light scatters through a tangle of IV bags hastily strung up\r\n       over MEN too poor to have anywhere else to go and die.\r\n\r\n       The RECRUITER kneels, speaking quietly to a particularly\r\n       hardened patient. He places a card in the man's emaciated\r\n       hand, then stands and walks toward a low doorway.\r\n\r\n       The recruiter enters a brightly lit room stacked high with\r\n       bags of rice. Two heavily armed THUGS fall in beside him.\r\n       The men scan the aisles as they move toward a door leading\r\n       out into an alley.\r\n\r\n                              DEADPOOL\r\n                    Agent Smith!\r\n\r\n       They turn to see DEADPOOL, high atop a stack of rice bags.\r\n\r\n                              DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                    I know, right?!

Deadpool leaps toward the\r\n       other, skewers him with both swords. The thug falls\r\n       backward, dead before he hits the ground.\r\n\r\nL44/VL44 EXT.

The sword\r\n       TWIRLS, SLASHES, LUNGES into shadow. A HANDKERCHIEF WIPES\r\n       BLOOD from the BLADE. The katana gets SHEATHED again.\r\n\r\n       The same yellow card is now RECEIVED and PUNCHED by Weasel.\r\n       Wade is paid in TWENTY DOLLAR BILLS. WHIP CREAM froths onto\r\n       a shot glass.

TICKETS CHURN\r\n       OUT. VANESSA catches a reflection of someone STARING at her\r\n       from across the lobby. When she spins around, the culprit is\r\n       GONE. Vanessa SHIVERS... but it's a warm shiver, somehow.\r\n\r\n       A HEAP of TICKETS slides across the prize counter. A big\r\n       STUFFED ANIMAL slides into Vanessa's arms.

Drinks consumed.\r\n\r\n      Skee-balls rolled into holes. Tickets won. Prizes earned.\r\n      Tossed onto a EVER-GROWING PILE in the closet. VANESSA\r\n      staring out her window.\r\n\r\n      Jergens pumped. Kleenexes pulled.       Crocs discarded.      BLIND\r\n      AL's ears plugged.\r\n\r\n      Ornaments are pinned to calendars.      Lords a-leap.      Swans a-\r\n      swim. Maids a-milk.\r\n\r\n      Mask comes off.    Head hits pillow.    Mask pulls on.\r\n\r\n      The images fly by FASTER... FASTER... FASTER.\r\n\r\n      Whip cream. Skee-balls.     Crocs.    Ornaments.   Weasel.\r\n      Deadpool. Vanessa. Al.\r\n\r\n      `I NEED A HERO' plays faster and faster, too - higher and\r\n      higher, like a record on too many RPMs.\r\n\r\n      The effect is rhythmic... hypnotic...\r\n\r\n      ...until finally, the montage REACHES a CRESCENDO.\r\n\r\n      And then BOOM!

THRUST! SLICE! IMPALE! COMPLETE MAYHEM.\r\n\r\n     Another trio of mercs rush around the corner, opening fire as\r\n     they see their comrades fall.

I'm never\r\n                gonna dance again... the way I danced\r\n                with you.\r\n\r\n     WHAM BELTS OUT `CARELESS WHISPER' as we ROLL CREDITS.\r\n                                                                 117.\r\n                 Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV76   INT.   SUBURBAN HOME - DAY - POST CREDIT SEQUENCE                 V76\r\n\r\n      A hallway of a suburban home.    DEADPOOL enters in a maroon\r\n      and gray striped robe.\r\n\r\n                           DEADPOOL\r\n                     (short version)\r\n                 You're still here? It's over! Go home.\r\n                 Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool\r\n                 2?! Sorry, we're low on dough. But if\r\n                 you can keep a secret, I can tell you\r\n                 who's gonna be in it. Cable! Someone\r\n                 suggested Mel Gibson for the role, buuuut-\r\n                 I was thinking Liam Neeson. Only\r\n                 problem, Liam likes to get paid. And\r\n                 more for Liam means less for me. Maybe\r\n                 we'll crowdfund the shit. Just you and\r\n                 me, kids. Shalom!\r\n\r\n                           DEADPOOL (CONT'D)\r\n                     (long version)\r\n                 You're still here? It's over! Go home.\r\n                 Wait... you expected a tease for Deadpool\r\n                 2?! Maybe a little Samuel L. Jackson?\r\n                 Sorry, that budget went to Weasel's\r\n                 Ketamine habit. But if you can keep a\r\n                 secret, I can tell you who's gonna be in\r\n                 it. Cable! You're allowed to show your\r\n                 pleasure. I'd love Liam Neeson for the\r\n                 role, but Liam likes to get paid. And\r\n                 more for Liam means less for me. So we'd\r\n                 best crowdfund the shit.
