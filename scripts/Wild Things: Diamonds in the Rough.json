It's an odd\n          design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...\n          \n          She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting\n          in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split\n          second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...\n          \n          \n          \n                                                         03/22/2004   10.\n          \n          \n          \n          She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking\n          beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.\n          \n          And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,\n          does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible\n          instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.\n          \n          Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help\n          but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...\n          \n          EXT.
