CANCUN HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - DAY\n</b>\n          The hotel is six stories high, a wall of glass and stucco.\n          Beach chairs are arrayed around the pool's edge; sunbathers\n          lie sprawled across them. A short boardwalk leads toward the\n          Gulf of Mexico: the white sand, the blue water.\n          Four young Americans are encamped near the pool's edge;\n          they're all in their early twenties. AMY lies face down on a\n          chaise, eyes shut, a cooler beside her. She's petite, with\n          short blond hair, her skin pinkly sunburned.\n          ERIC sits in the chair beside her, studying the Cliff Notes\n          for The Canterbury Tales. He's leanly muscular, with dark\n          curly hair. Other Cliff Notes lie scattered beneath his\n          chair: Antigone, A Separate Peace, Hea rt of Darkness, 1984.\n\n          JEFF and STACY sit on the far side of the cooler; they're\n          playing gin. Stacy, too, is petite, with short hair, though\n          hers,. is dark. She's wearing a pale blue bikini, and has a\n          beer bottle in her hand. She looks a little bored.\n          Jeff is tall, scrawny. Like Eric, he has a pair of swim\n          trunks on, and is deeply tanned. He's very focused, frowning\n          down at his cards.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          We should play War. It's more fun.\n          Jeff takes a card from his hand, lays it down on the table.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          That's not even a game.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Sure it is. I'll teach you.\n          She starts-to fold her hand,'but Jeff shakes his head.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          I know how to play. I mean it's\n          just chance--there's no skill\n          involved.\n\n          Stacy frowns down at her hand, silenced. She picks a card\n          from the deck, immediately discards it. Jeff snatches it up,\n          lays down one of his own. Stacy stares at it in dismay.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          But I keep losing.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          2.\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          'Cause you're not concentrating.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I wouldn't have to concentrate if\n          we played War.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Exactly. So where's the fun?\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I'd win sometimes. It's not fun if\n          we both can't win.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          But it's not winning if it's just\n          chance.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Of course it is. If we flipped a\n          coin, and I called heads, and it--\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Fuck..;this.. shit.\n\n          Eric throws the Canterbury Tales to the ground. Then he\n          rises, steps to the cooler, pulls out a beer, carries it back\n          to his chair. Stacy watches as he takes a long swallow.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Maybe you should just be honest,\n          sweetie.\n\n          Eric doesn't even glance at her. He sips his beer again.\n\n          STACY (cont'd)\n          You could say: look, I don't know\n          anything about these either, so now\n          we're gonna read them together and\n          sort of teach each other as we go.\n          (turning to Jeff)\n          Wouldn't you have loved that? To\n          have a teacher who--\n\n          Amy speaks without opening her eyes, cutting Stacy off:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Why would they hire you if you\n          haven't read the books?\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          I said I had.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          3.\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          So maybe you should..\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          (appalled by the idea)\n          The Canterbury Tales?

It's not even English.\n          Jeff watches Stacy take another card; she examines it, sets\n          it on the discard pile. Then, RECITING:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          This world nys but a thurghfare ful\n          of wo, and we been pilgrymes,\n          passing to and fro. Deeth is an\n          ende of every worldly soore.\n\n          Eric and Stacy stare at Jeff in astonishment. Amy doesn't\n          react. Jeff glances toward her.\n\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Sunscreen, Amy.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I'm fine. I've got a base.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          You're burning.

It's too hot.\n          Stacy leans forward, picks a second card off the deck. Jeff\n          is focused on Amy; he doesn't notice.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          You're hot because you're burning.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          It's only been--\n          Stacy interrupts, speaking in a slightly SINGSONG fashion:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          4.\n</b>\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So there was this king, who lived\n          in a castle.\n          Amy turns, gives her a pained look.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Please don't.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But what he really wanted was a\n          beach house.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Stop it. Both of you. Right now.\n          They ignore her, ping-ponging quickly back and forth:\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So he decided to move.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But the Queen didn't want to.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So he left by himself.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But he got lonely.\n          Amy covers her ears with her hands, blocking out their\n          voices, but then inmiediately reaches to feel for her\n          earrings: one of them is missing.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Shit.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So he bought a dog.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But it had fleas.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I lost my earring.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So he gave it a bath.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But the dog caught. cold.\n          Amy sits up, glancing about. Stacy and Eric keep going:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          5.\n</b>\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So he gave it some medicine.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But it was the wrong kind.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          So the dog died.\n          Amy rises, steps toward the pool. Jeff lays down his cards,\n          joins her beside the water. They both peer into it.\n\n<b>          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - BOARDWALK - DAY\n</b>\n          A young man is approaching down the boardwalk from the beach,\n          carrying fins, a mask, a snorkel. He's in his early\n          twenties: blond, crew-cut, very tall. His name is MATHIAS.\n          As he nears the pool, he stops, staring.\n\n<b>          MATHIAS'S POV - THE POOL\n</b>          Eric and Stacy have risen to join Jeff and Amy; they're all\n          peering into the water. Amy holds her remaining earring out\n          to Eric and Stacy, showing them what it looks like.\n\n<b>          BACK TO SCENE - MATHIAS\n</b>          He stands there, hesitating. Then he starts forward.\n\n<b>          MATHIAS'S POV - THROUGH THE MASK - UNDERWATER - DAY\n</b>          We glide just above the pool's pale blue bottom. A silver\n          earring comes into view. Mathias's hand reaches for it.\n\n<b>          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - DAY\n</b>\n          The two couples have spread out around the pool's edge,\n          searching for the earring. Mathias surfaces in front of Amy.\n          He holds out his hand, with the earring-in it; she stares,\n          startled, then crouches to take it.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Thank you so much.\n          .Mathias nods. He starts to turn, as if to swim off, but Jeff\n          stops him:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          6.\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Wait. . .want a beer?\n          He waves toward their chairs, the cooler beside them.\n\n<b>          EXT. CANCUN HOTEL - POOL - LATER\n</b>\n          Mathias and the two couples sit together, with their beers.\n          Amy's skin has turned deep red; Stacy is behind her, applying\n          lotion to her shoulders. Eric is talking to Mathias:\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          We went sailing yesterday. Out\n          toward Cozumel? And there were\n          these seven foot fish, these huge--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Nurse sharks.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          (he nods)\n          Like thirty of them.

And they were lying on\n          the bottom, just waiting for\n          somebody to come swimming by--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They're not dangerous.\n          Eric turns, stares at Jeff.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          You said they're sharks.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          But they're not dangerous. They\n          eat lobsters. Sea urchins. That\n          sort of thing.\n          Eric considers this, frowning. Then he takes a sip of beer.\n          He shrugs, turns back toward Mathias.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          I wouldn't be snorkeling on my own.'\n          That's all I'm saying.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          7.\n</b>          When Mathias speaks, it's with a SLIGHT GERMAN ACCENT:\n\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          I wasn't on my own. I was with my\n          brother.\n          Jeff glances around the pool.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          He's here?\n          Mathias shakes his head.\n\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          He met a girl. They went away.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          To?\n\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          It's a complicated story.\n          They watch him, waiting for more, but nothing comes. Finally:\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          You should hang with us, then. If\n          you're on your own.\n          (he glances at the others)\n          Right?\n          Everyone nods, smiling. Eric reaches into the cooler, pulls\n          out another beer, holds it toward Mathias.\n\n<b>          EXT. CANCUN BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\n          There's a DJ, a dozen beer kegs. A few young men and women\n          are dancing beside a bonfire, but most of the crowd is\n          scattered in small groups across the sand, TALKING, drinking,\n          the firelight flickering off their faces.\n          Stacy, Amy, Eric, Jeff and Mathias are sitting together; they\n          all have cups of beer. Stacy is between Eric's legs, leaning\n          against his chest. Amy, Jeff and Mathias sit cross-legged.\n          Everyone but Jeff and Mathias is a little drunk, and you can\n          hear it in their voices. Amy drains her cup, stands up, very\n          unsteadily. She holds out her hand to Jeff.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Dance.\n          Eric smiles, as if the idea of Jeff dancing were absurd.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          8.\n</b>\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Jeff doesn't dance, Amy--he has no\n          rhythm. Of all his many gifts,\n          rhythm is not one.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          That's not true. He played the\n          trombone in high school. He won a\n          prize.\n          Eric seems startled by this, amused.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Seriously?\n          Amy nods. She drains her beer, tosses the cup aside.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Jeff's won prizes for everything.\n          His Mom has a whole room built just\n          for them. Trophies and ribbons and\n          plaques. He's a very accomplished\n          young man.\n          (she holds out her hand-to\n\n<b>          ERIC)\n</b>          You?\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          (he shakes his head)\n          I don't dance on sand.\n          Stacy makes a SNORTING sound.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Or grass.

Before he can speak, Stacy pushes\n          herself to her feet; she's almost as wobbly as Amy.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I'll dance.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          9.\n</b>          They lurch off across the sand toward the bonfire. The boys\n          watch them go. A beat, then Jeff glances at his watch.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          I'm gonna head back.\n          Eric gives him a look of disappointment,\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          You're kidding.\n          Jeff seems STARTLED by this:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          What?\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          How long is med school?

Eric turns toward Mathias.\n          ERIC (cont'd)\n          He's gonna be grinding away all\n          that time. Sleepless. Fucking\n          miserable. And know what? He's\n          gonna look back on this night, us\n          right here, and he's gonna say to\n          himself, shit, I wish I'd--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Gone to bed earlier.\n          Eric stares at him; this wasn't the direction he was heading.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          If I'm gonna be so short on sleep,\n          I should get as.much as I can now,\n          don't you think?\n          He stands up, brushes the sand from his shorts. Eric shrugs,\n          lifts his cup toward him.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          All work and no play--\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          10.\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Makes a man healthy, wealthy, and\n          wise.\n          With that, Jeff nods good night to them, then starts off\n          toward the hotel. Eric and Mathias turn back toward the\n          bonfire. They sit in silence, watching the girls dance.\n          After a moment, Amy staggers away from the other dancers,\n          toward a group of young men, drinking together in the\n          shadows. She reaches down, pulls one of them to his feet,\n          starts to drag him back toward the bonfire.\n          The young man is tall, with long blond hair. He LAUGHS,\n          tries to free himself, but Amy is insistent; she keeps\n          pulling at him, and finally he surrenders. They begin to\n          dance. Stacy is dancing on her own, eyes shut, oblivious.\n          Mathias glances toward Eric.

Amy and her partner's dancing is\n          becoming steadily more intimate, the gap between their bodies\n          narrowing, then disappearing altogether.

They join Stacy and\n          Amy, and Eric subtly interrupts Amy's pas de deux. The blond-\n          haired young man disengages, drifts back toward his friends.\n\n<b>          EXT. CANCUN BEACH - DAWN\n</b>\n          It's quiet, the sun just breaking the horizon; the beach is\n          nearly empty. A handful of hotel employees are tidying up\n          after the bonfire: carrying off the empty kegs, raking clean\n          the rubbish-strewn sand.

There's a gravel\n          turnaround, with a bus idling in it. Its door CREAKS open.\n          A dozen tourists emerge from the bus, blinking in the\n          sunlight. Jeff, Amy, Stacy, Eric, and Mathias are among\n          them. The boys have the knapsacks; the girls are wearing\n          matching hats. Amy rubs at her face, stretching, waking up.-\n          There's a souvenir stand at the town's entrance, with\n          brightly colored blankets hanging from its walls. The\n          tourists start toward it, leaving Jeff and the others beside.\n          the idling bus. They peer about, getting their bearings.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Now what?\n          Mathias has his brother's note.

Behind it, a yellow pickup truck\n          is revealed. \"TAXI\" is hand-painted in black on its side.\n          They start toward the truck. Its DRIVER is Mayan: short and\n          heavy-set, with thick glasses. His eyes are shut; he's\n          dozing behind the wheel. The truck's engine.is running, the\n          windows shut tight against the heat.\n          Jeff TAPS the window, and there's a burst of movement from\n          the truck's rear, as a dog springs up, BARKING and GROWLING.\n          They all leap back, the girls SHRIEKING.\n          The dog is a mutt--small, but muscular. He's attached to a\n          cinder block by a short chain, which he throws himself\n          against, slobbering, snapping at the air.\n          They all stare at the dog; the girls LAUGH nervously,\n          clutching each other. The driver has roused himself; he\n          leans forward, rolls down his window, stares out at them.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Hola.\n          The man gives him a somber nod; the dog keeps BARKING.

Then, in HEAVILY ACCENTED ENGLISH:\n\n<b>          DRIVER\n</b>          Why you go this place?\n          Jeff struggles for a simple way to explain their mission. in\n          the back of the truck, the dog continues its frantic BARRING.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          There are these ruins.

Still you go?\n          His smile has disappeared; he seems angry suddenly, as if\n          Jeff has somehow insulted him. Jeff hesitates, glancing\n          toward the others again. Then, in a CONCILIATORY TONE:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          We're looking for his brother.\n          (he points toward Mathias)\n          Su hermano?\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          20.\n</b>          The driver wrenches the door open, making Jeff and the others\n          flinch. He climbs out, still with that angry expression on\n          his face, then leans into the back of the truck, grabs the\n          dog's chain, unhooks it from the cinder block.\n          He lifts the dog from the truck by the chain. Even dangling\n          by its neck, the mutt continues to SNARL and snap at Jeff and\n          the others. They back away, and the man tosses the dog into\n          the truck's cab, pushing the door shut. The dog throws its\n          body against the window, slobbering and BARKING.\n          The man turns toward Jeff, wiping his hands on his pants.\n          Jeff tries again:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          I'm sure your ruins are better than\n          these. It's just that we--\n          The driver cuts him off, holding out his hand, with that same\n          air of enraged disgust.\n\n<b>          DRIVER\n</b>          El dinero.\n          Jeff gives him the money. Then the driver SLAPS the side of\n          the truck, gestures for them to climb into the back.\n\n<b>          EXT.

There are fields on\n          either side of the road, bordered by thick jungle.\n          The truck reaches a fork in the road, bears left, angling\n          toward the wall of jungle, into which it vanishes, the\n          overhanging foliage blocking it from sight.\n\n<b>          EXT. YUCATAN ROAD - IN THE JUNGLE - DAY\n</b>\n          The road is dirt, heavily rutted. There's a small clearing\n          beside it, with a path opening off it. The trees grow over\n          the path, forming a shady tunnel. WE HEAR birds calling, a\n          steady throb of insect life, but otherwise all is silent.\n          A beat, then there's the sound of the TRUCK approaching,\n          along with the dog's BARKING and GROWLING. The pickup\n          appears, moving slowly, bouncing and swaying across the ruts.\n          The truck pulls into the little clearing, stops. Jeff and\n          the others clamber out over its tailgate.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          21.\n</b>          The dog is still lunging at them from behind the truck's rear\n          window. Jeff gives the driver a wave.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Gracias, senor!\n          The driver doesn't even look at him; he just pulls out onto\n          the road, heading back in the direction from which they came.\n          There are mosquitoes; Stacy starts to slap at herself. Jeff\n          unslings his pack, pulls out a can of insect repellent.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Here.\n          He begins to spray her, then Eric. Amy is peering off after\n          the truck. They can still hear the dog's BARKING, but very\n          faintly now. Jeff finishes with Eric, starts in on Mathias.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          How do we get back?\n          She points back down the road, toward the vanished truck.\n          Jeff pauses in his spraying, considers for a moment. Then:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          The guidebook said you can always\n          flag down a passing bus. So I--\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          There aren't going to be any buses\n          on that road.\n          Jeff nods; this seems obvious. He resumes spraying Mathias.\n          Eric and Stacy stand there, watching.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          A bus couldn't even fit.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          It also said you can hitch--\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          See any cars pass, Jeff?\n          Jeff doesn't answer. He steps toward her, starts to spray\n          her, too. She holds out her arms.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          The whole time we were driving, you\n          see even one?\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Eric has his phone.

He stares at it for a\n          beat, then shakes his head, snaps it shut. Jeff finishes\n          spraying Amy, starts in on himself.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They must-have a way to get\n          supplies in.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Who?\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          The archaeologists.

Amy is still focused on Jeff:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          We're stranded, aren't we? That's,\n          like, a twenty mile walk we're\n          gonna have to do.

Jeff turns to the others.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Ready?\n          Mathias and Eric nod, and the boys start down the path. Amy\n          stands there, watching them go.

It resumes on the far bank,\n          rising gradually uphill in a long straightaway. The stream\n          is slow moving, the water dark brown. Eric SNIFFS the air.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Fucking smells.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They must use it as a latrine.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Who?\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          The village. The Mayans.\n          They start toward it, gingerly, the girls covering their\n          noses. Jeff crosses the stream, hopping from boulder to\n          boulder, and the others follow. Stacy almost falls in; she\n          only catches her balance at the final instant, YELPING.\n          Jeff is already starting up the trail, searching for the\n          turnoff. There's no sign of it; the dense foliage extends\n          unbroken as far as the eye can see. He turns to Mathias.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          How far past the stream?.\n\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          Right after, it says.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          26.\n</b>          They stand there in a loose group, staring at the trees.\n          Eric pulls a bottle of water from his pack, takes a swallow,\n          then passes it to Stacy. Amy lifts her arm, points.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Look.\n          Up the trail, sixty feet away, stand two small Mayan boys;\n          they seem to have materialized out of the air. They're ten\n          years old, shirtless, scrawny, dark-haired. one of them is\n          holding a bicycle by its handlebars; it doesn't have a seat.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Maybe they can guide us.\n          Stacy smiles toward the boys; she waves, CALLS OUT:\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>\n<b>          HOLAL\n</b>          The boys just stand there, staring at them, silent, their\n          expressions wary, even frightened.

The German is staring toward the\n          edge of the trail, where a large bush sits. one of its\n          fronds is very slowly dropping toward them, pulling itself\n          free of the soil.\n          Mathias steps forward, tugs at a second frond, which slips\n          easily from the dirt. He tosses it aside, reaches for\n          another frond: this, too, slips free. Someone has pushed\n          them into the earth, arranging them to look like a bush.\n          Mathias pulls a fourth frond free, then a fifth, and an\n          opening is revealed in the brush, a narrow path winding its\n          way off through the trees. They stand there a beat, staring\n           at it. Then there's a SQUEAKING SOUND, and they all turn.\n\n<b>          AMY'S POV - UP THE TRAIL\n</b>          one of the boys is hurriedly pedaling off, bent low over the\n          bicycle's handlebars.

They keep staring from the boy to the newly\n          revealed path, trying to make sense of it. WE can still HEAR\n          the squeaking of the bicycle, growing steadily fainter.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          It's on the map.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          It's a hand-drawn map, Jeff.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          And it was hidden. Why would it be\n          hidden?\n          Jeff steps forward, shields his eyes, tries to peer into the\n          dimness of the narrow path. Then he glances back toward the\n          little boy, who continues to stand there, watching them.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Maybe the archaeologists don't want\n          people to find the mine.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Because?\n          Jeff has to think.

And\n          they don't want anyone to come rob\n          them. So they've asked the Mayans\n          to help keep people away.\n          He falls into silence, staring at the boy. No one appears\n          very convinced by his theory, not even Jeff. He shrugs.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          How much farther is it?\n          Mathias takes the map from his pocket again, glances at it.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          28.\n</b>\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          Not far.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Be silly to stop now, don't you\n          think?\n          No one answers; no one moves.\n\n<b>          ANY\n</b>          This just feels weird, Jeff.\n          Jeff SIGHS, fighting to suppress his impatience with her.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          So we what? Turn around? Walk all\n          the way back to Coba?\n          Silence. They all turn to stare back down the trail, then\n          toward the Mayan boy, who's still watching them. Stacy SLAPS\n          a mosquito, leaving a bloody smear on her bare arm. Jeff\n          lifts his hand, gestures at the path.leading into the trees.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Come on. We're almost there.\n          The others glance at one another, waiting for someone to\n          argue; no one does. Finally, Mathias steps forward, slipping\n          through the narrow opening. Eric follows him, and then, with\n          just the slightest hesitation, so do Amy and Stacy.\n          Jeff throws one last glance toward the boy--who's still\n          standing there, sixty feet away, watching with his anxious\n          expression--and then he, too, vanishes into the trees.\n\n<b>          EXT.

They follow the path as it curves first\n          right, then left, moving gradually uphill all the while, and\n          suddenly there's sunlight in front of them, bright and\n          intense: a clearing. They hesitate at its edge, staring.\n\n<b>          EXT.

Its soil is a deep black, flecked with white, like\n          frost rime.

And\n          everywhere, hanging off it, are those bright red flowers.\n          Mathias moves toward the orange tent, and Jeff follows him.\n          They UNZIP its flap, stoop to peer inside.\n\n<b>          JEFF'S POV - INSIDE-THE ORANGE TENT\n</b>          The vine has taken root in here, too, growing on some things,\n          leaving others untouched.

The hole is rectangular--ten feet by six\n          feet--and very deep; we can't see its bottom.\n          A windlass has been constructed beside the hole, a horizontal\n          barrel with a hand crank welded to its base. Rope is coiled\n          around the barrel. From there, it passes over a small wheel,\n          which hangs from a sawhorse straddling the hole's mouth.\n          Then it drops straight into the earth.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          The mine?\n          Jeff nods. A draft is rising from the hole, and it lifts off\n          Amy's hat. She tries to catch it, but fumbles: the hat\n          falls away from her. They all watch it vanish into the dark.\n          Eric pulls out his phone, flips it open, almost\n          absentmindedly: a nervous gesture.

Stacy and Amy are holding hands, looking stricken.\n          Stacy has started to CRY. Eric has his arm around her.\n          The Mayans keep their weapons raised.

That's the one thing we know\n          for certain.\n          An electronic CHIRPING comes from the shaft: it sounds like\n          a cell phone ringing. Mathias turns his head, listening. No\n          one else notices it.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          But what will we eat? How will we--\n          The RINGING comes again, silencing her. She glances toward\n          the shaft, not quite believing what she's hearing. It comes\n          a THIRD TIME, and they all stand up, step to the hole, peer\n          into its darkness. The RINGING comes yet again.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          A cell phone.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          It can't be--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          That's a cell phone, Amy.\n          Definitely.\n\n<b>          .AMY\n</b>          But there's no signal out here.\n          Eric can't get a signal.\n          Reflexively, Eric pulls out his phone, checks again:\n          nothing.

The others are starting to smile, too.\n          Mathias moves to the windlass. He unrolls some of the rope,\n          starts to wrap it around his chest. Jeff watches him.\n          Another RING.\n          The vine has taken root on the windlass:- the sawhorse, the\n          barrel, the rope. Jeff steps forward, begins to yank it off,\n          careful not to get the sap on his hands. He turns to Amy.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          There's a lamp in the orange tent.\n          See if you can find some matches,\n          too.\n          Amy hurries off toward the orange tent, vanishing inside.\n          There's a final RING, and then SILENCE again. Mathias is\n          knotting the rope tightly around his chest.\n          Amy returns, carrying an oil lamp, a box of matches.\n          Everyone watches as Jeff crouches to light the lamp. Then he\n          rises, turns toward Mathias, looks at him closely.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          You sure?\n          Mathias nods, takes the lamp, steps to the edge of the hole.\n          Jeff and Eric move to the windlass; they position themselves\n          at the hand crank, leaning into it, so the rope goes taut.\n          Mathias girds himself, steps out over the hole. He dangles\n          there for a moment, hanging beneath the sawhorse, the\n          windlass GROANING on its mount. Then Jeff and Eric begin to\n          reverse the crank, letting the rope slowly spool out.\n          Stacy and Amy stand beside the shaft, peering into it,\n          watching as Mathias begins his descent--ten feet, twenty\n          feet, thirty feet down, and still only darkness beneath him,\n          with no sign of the shaft's bottom.\n          The windlass CREAKS as it turns; Jeff and Eric strain against\n          it, sweating, muscles taut. Amy has turned from the shaft,\n          is watching: the rope as it slowly unspools from the barrel.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Jeff.\n          He turns to look, and she points at the rope, where it comes\n          off the windlass and angles up toward the little wheel\n          hanging from the sawhorse.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          47.\n</b>          AMY (cont'd)\n          The sap...\n          They'd cleared off most of the vine from the rope, but not\n          all of it. Some of these remaining tendrils have been\n          crushed as the windlass slowly unspools.

Eric steps toward\n          her, gives her a tight hug. He holds her eyes for a moment,\n          kisses her. Then he joins Jeff at the hand crank. They lean\n          against it, and the rope goes taut.\n          Stacy steps out into the open air over the shaft, the lamp in\n          her right hand. With her left hand, she lunges, grabs at the\n          sawhorse, clings tightly to it.

A large piece of glass is\n          imbedded there, just beneath her knee. it's the size of a\n          playing card, gently concave,'dark with her blood.

She lifts her hands, palms-up, beseeching.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Help us. Please. Someone's been\n          hurt. He--\n          Jeff comes to a halt, five feet behind her.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They can't understand you.\n          She turns, her voice quickened with PANIC:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Say it in Spanish. Tell them he--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They don't speak Spanish.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Try it.

The bald man SHOUTS at her, a single short\n          sentence in MAYAN. Amy holds out her hands to him.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Espanol? Habla Espanol?\n          Jeff steps forward, grabs her elbow.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They killed Henrich. Why would-\n          Amy tries to tug free, but he won't let her. She starts to\n          SHOUT at the Mayans:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Help usi We need help!\n          The Mayans just stare at her, their weapons raised, their\n          faces expressionless. one of them is much younger than the\n          others, almost a boy. He says something in MAYAN to the bald\n          man, and the bald man shakes his head.\n          Amy begins to CRY. Jeff pulls at her elbow.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          We have to get back.\n          Amy turns toward him, her face smeared with tears.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I didn't want to come. I told you\n          we shouldn't. I said--\n          Jeff tightens his grip on her arm, gives her a little shake,\n          as if to wake her up.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Listen to me.

It's your fault.\n          It's all your--\n          Jeff shakes her again, more roughly, his voice like a slap:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          61.\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          YD-q stepped onto the hill.\n          Amy stares at him, startled into silence.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          They wouldn't have forced us up it\n          if you hadn't.\n          He holds her eyes, making sure she understands. Then:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Now let's go, okay?\n          He starts to pull her back toward the trail. She allows\n          herself to be led; she's begun to CRY again:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I didn't know. I just--\n          She's growing increasingly upset, almost SOBBING. She tries\n          to turn back toward the Mayans again, but Jeff won't let her.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          They have to help us.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They're not going to.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          They have to.\n          She wrenches herself free, stumbles, falls into the vines\n          beside the trail. Jeff reaches for her, but she kicks away\n          from him, grabbing at the vines, scrambling to her feet.\n          As she rises, she yanks up a tendril, a clot of earth hanging\n          from its roots. She SCREAMS, spinning toward the clearing---\n          AMY (cont'd)\n\n<b>          WHY WON'T YOU FUCKING HELP US?\n</b>          --and throws the tendril at the Mayans. They scramble\n          backward, with surprising panic, SHOUTING. The youngest of\n          them is too slow: the length of vine hits him in the leg.\n          He stares down at the tendril in shock.\n          The others back hurriedly away from him. Two of them\n          continue to point their weapons at Amy, but the bald man and\n          one of the other bowmen are aiming at the young Mayan now.\n          There's SHOUTING from the tree line. The entire campsite is\n          on its feet; a woman begins to SCREAM.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          62.\n</b>          She's in her,forties, short and stout, and she starts forward\n          into the clearing, arms stretched toward the young Mayan.\n          Two of the other women grab her, hold her back.\n          The bald Mayan starts to ADDRESS the young man, pointing up\n          the hillside. The short woman keeps SCREAMING, flailing,\n          trying to break free. The young Mayan looks at her, then at\n          the bald man. He speaks in MAYAN, a brief burst of words.\n          The bald man shakes his head, points up the hill again, his\n          pistol aimed at the young man's chest. The short woman is\n          WAILING, eyes shut. The young Mayan takes a step toward her,\n          CALLING what seems to be her name.\n          The bald man SHOUTS at him, but the young Mayan ignores him,\n          takes a second step, then a third. The bowmen are all aiming\n          at him now, and suddenly, everyone seems to be YELLING.\n          The young Mayan takes a fifth step, holding out his arms\n          toward the WAILING woman, CALLING to her. The bald man\n          FIRES, shooting him in the head. At the same instant, the\n          bowmen let their arrows fly, the shafts THUMPING into the\n          young man's chest, burying themselves to the fletches.\n          The clearing goes still; the only sound is the woman's steady\n          WAILING. Then the bald man swings his pistol toward Amy and\n          Jeffs he SHOUTS in MAYAN at them. The other Mayans nock\n          fresh arrows, draw their bows.\n          Jeff takes a step backward, half-raising his hands. Amy just\n          stands there, her eyes on the young Mayan's motionless body.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>\n<b>          AMY...\n</b>          (no reaction)\n\n<b>          AY.\n</b>          She turns, finally. She looks horrified, stupefied; her\n          hands are burned a deep red from the vine's sap. Jeff waves\n          her up the hill. She stares at him for another beat, and\n          then, without a word, starts to climb the trail.\n          Jeff hesitates, watching the Mayans: the bloodied corpse,\n          the raised weapons, the KEENING woman. Then he, too, turns\n          and hurries off up the trail.\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          Amy, Jeff, and Eric have taken down the blue tent; its\n          contents lie tumbled in a pile in the little clearing. All\n          three of them look sun struck, sweat-stained, worn out.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          63.\n</b>          Eric is using a knife to cut long strips from the blue nylon.\n          Amy is braiding three of the strips together. Jeff has one\n          of the backpack frames, the roll of duct tape, and some of\n          the poles from the tent; he's making a backboard.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Maybe we could use it as a weapon,\n          you know? Wrap it around some\n          stones or something. And throw\n          them, like grenades. I mean, if\n          they're that scared of it--\n          Jeff tears off a piece of tape with his teeth.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          They have guns, Eric. And bows.\n          What do you think they'll do if we\n          start throwing the vine at them?\n          Eric is silenced by this. He cuts another long strip of\n          nylon, passes it to Amy. But he can't seem to stop himself\n          from talking:\n\n<b>          ERIC.\n</b>          So you figure it's, what? Sacred\n          or something? Like, you touch it\n          and you have to die?\n          Amy begins to cry suddenly--a SOB, quickly suppressed. Jeff\n          and Eric both turn to look at her. The vine's sap has\n          scarred her hands and arms almost to the elbows. She wipes\n          her eyes, takes a deep breath, shakes her head.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I'm okay.\n          But she doesn't look it. Jeff removes his hat, holds it out.\n          Amy just stares at it; he nods for her to take it.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Come on. You're burning.\n          She reaches for the hat, puts it on, then wipes at her eyes\n          again. Jeff leans forward, touches her.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          We're gonna get through this. All\n          right? We'll pull them up. And\n          then ...I don't know--we'll figure\n          things out. it has to rain at some\n          point. And maybe we can snare some\n          birds.

The RING sounds again.\n          Mathias turns his head, peers toward the shaft cut into the\n          dirt wall to his left: that's where it's coming from. Stacy\n          reaches to pick up the lamp, rises to her feet. Another\n          RING. Jeff SHOUTS down from above:\n\n<b>          JEFF (O.S.)\n</b>          Stacy...?\n          Stacy ignores him; she limps around Mathias, starts toward\n          the opening. She hesitates at the mouth of the shaft,\n          lifting her lamp to see better. There's another RING.\n\n<b>          -STACY'S POV -- INTO THE SHAFT\n</b>          The lamp's light doesn't penetrate very far, but WE can SEE\n          that the vine has taken root here with great avidity: it\n          grows thickly on the walls, floor and roof. There's a steady\n          draft coming toward us, and the plant shifts in it, RUSTLING.\n\n<b>          BACK TO SCENE\n</b>          Stacy stands there, looking scared.

The ringing\n          falls SILENT. Stacy turns, hobbles back toward Mathias, and\n          the light shudders, dims for a moment. She squints at it:\n          the oil is nearly gone. She SHOUTS up to the others:\n          STACY (cont'd)\n          The lamp's almost out of oil.\n\n<b>          JEFF (O.S.)\n</b>          Then blow it out.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          65.\n</b>          Stacy seems terrified by this.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Blow it out?\n\n<b>          JEFF (0.5.)\n</b>          We'll need it when we come down.\n          To get him on the backboard.\n          Stacy drops into a crouch beside Mathias, sets the lamp down\n          before her, stares at it. She clearly doesn't want to blow\n          it out. Mathias watches her, silent.\n          JEFF (O.S.) (cont'd)\n          All right?\n          Stacy leans forward, lifts the lamp's glass chimney, blows\n          out the flame, dropping the shaft into darkness.\n\n<b>          EXT.

They step to the windlass, lean against its hand\n          crank, the rope going taut. Amy stands by the shaft,\n          gathering her courage. Then she reaches for the backboard.\n\n<b>          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT\n</b>          Mathias and Stacy are two dim shapes in the darkness. The\n          windlass begins its CREAKING.

But then, with three feet still to go, it\n          jerks to a halt, almost toppling Amy from her perch.\n          A beat, and Jeff's voice comes toward them from above:\n\n<b>          JEFF (O.S.)\n</b>          Have you reached them?\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Almost.

There's a faint, almost\n          fungus-like green growing on his shirt, an infantile version\n          of the vine covering the hillside all around them. It's on\n          all of them: their shirts, their pants, their shoes.\n          Before any of them can respond to this development, Amy\n          starts to CALL from the clearing, sounding SCARED:\n\n<b>          AMY (O.S.)\n</b>          Jeff...?\n          They all turn toward the flap. Mathias begins to SCREAM.\n          Amy's voice JUMPS in volume:\n           AMY (O.S.) (cont'd)\n          of .I\n          Jeff rises, moves toward the flap.\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          Amy is crouched over Mathias, frantically yanking the vines\n          off him. Mathias is struggling impotently to sit up. He\n          continues to SCREAM, staring down at his legs.\n          Jeff emerges-from the tent, hurries to help Amy, both of them\n          tearing at the vine, a flash of white appearing beneath the\n          green, shiny and bright: bones. Mathias's legs have been\n          stripped completely clean of flesh from the knee down.\n          As they keep pulling the tendrils free, blood starts to drip\n          from Mathias's knees, slowly at first, but then suddenly\n          spurting, spraying them: their chests, their faces. Amy\n          jerks backward, GAGGING, RETCHING.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          80.\n</b>          She jumps up, takes three steps into the center of the\n          clearing, and VOMITS, her hands on her knees. She wipes at\n          the blood on her face, COUGHS, spits, then bends again,\n          another long ribbon of puke slipping free of her.\n          Mathias continues to SCREAM and thrash. Jeff reaches for the\n          belts, lying in the dirt beside the backboard. He quickly\n          ties first one then another around Mathias's legs, twisting\n          them into tourniquets, cutting off the flow of blood.\n          Stacy and Eric stoop out through the tent's flap: they stand\n          there staring, struggling to grasp what's happened. Stacy is\n          in her underwear and T-shirt, blood still seeping down her\n          leg. Amy turns to face them.\n          Mathias is WEEPING now, his eyes shut. The hemorrhaging has\n          stopped; blood lies in puddles across the backboard. Jeff is\n          covered with it. And then there are the bones: so white, so\n          wet-looking, from the knees down, nothing but bone.\n          Suddenly, Stacy starts to SCREAM, pointing past Amy, at the\n          dirt beyond her. They all turn to look.\n          The vine is in motion, a long tendril slipping into the\n          clearing, moving snakelike toward the puddle of vomit at\n          Amy's feet. Amy backs quickly away.\n          A second tendril emerges from the low wall of green around\n          the clearing, then a third. They move rapidly, as if racing\n          each other; both of them slipping alongside the first into\n          the little pool of vomit.\n          The tendrils absorb the puke, draining it, until all that's\n          left is a damp shadow on the rocky soil. Then they withdraw\n          back across the clearing, silently retreating into the larger\n          mass of green. Stacy keeps SCREAMING.\n\n<b>          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY\n</b>\n          Faintly, from up the hill, WE HEAR Stacy's screams. The\n          Mayans are finishing their morning meal. They eat in\n          silence, showing no reaction to the sound. In the clearing,\n          the young Mayan's corpse is buried beneath a thick growth of\n          vine.\n\n<b>          EXT..

That's all there is.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          And then the Mayans cleared the\n          jungle around the hill, I guess.\n          To keep it quarantined.

And we're\n          some sort of sacrifice?\n          He glances at the others, but once again no one responds.\n          They all look dazed: knocked back into themselves.

From his\n          knees down, Mathias's legs are nothing but bone, tendon, and\n          ropy clots of blackened blood. His face looks gray. His\n          eyes are shut, and his breathing sounds terribly RAGGED.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          He wouldn't be able to stomach it.\n          Jeff offers Stacy her ration.

I got it out.\n          Jeff pops his square of sandwich into his mouth; Eric and Amy\n          eat theirs, too. Stacy's ration remains in her hand; she\n          seems to have forgotten it. She's sunburned, sweat-stained,\n          glassy-eyed. Eric leans toward her, looking worried.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Eat, Stacy.

When it\n          returns to Jeff, he takes his sip, caps the bottle. Eric is\n          watching Stacy, her anxious probing; he looks increasingly\n          distressed by it. He jumps up again.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          The phone. Let's find the phone.\n          Jeff doesn't move.

Mathias is\n          trying to rise onto his elbow, straining to see what's\n          happening.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Hold him.\n          Eric sets the canteen into the flames, sloshes some tequila\n          on it, then shifts.to the backboard. He presses down on\n          Mathias''s shoulders. Mathias is WHIMPERING, twisting his\n          head back and forth, gripping the belt tightly in his teeth.\n          Jeff starts to saw with the knife, chopping and cutting the\n          splintered bones. Bloody marrow spills wetly out, and then\n          Mathias's.lower leg comes free of his body, the foot and\n          ankle and shin bones completely separate now.\n          Jeff lifts the bones away, drops them into the dirt beside\n          the backboard. Then he turns, uses the towel to pluck the\n          canteen out of the fire: it, too, is glowing red.\n          He presses the canteen flat against Mathias's stump, the\n          flesh SIZZLING and SPITTING. Mathias bucks even more\n          forcefully; he spits out the belt, CRIES OUT:\n\n<b>          MATHIAS\n</b>          Stop...stop...\n          Jeff ignores him, dropping the canteen back into the fire,\n          lifting out the stone. Eric looks increasingly mortified; he\n          seems close to tears.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF--\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Reep him still.\n          He turns, SMASHES the stone into Mathias's right leg.\n          Mathias begins to SCREAM, bucking against Eric's grip.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          89.\n</b>\n<b>          INT.

Amy is\n          staring toward the flap with a look of horror.\n\n<b>          EXT.

Eric is using all his weight to\n          hold him still, his head averted, his eyes clenched shut.\n          Jeff lifts the severed bones.away from the backboard, drops\n          them at his side. Then he scoops up the canteen again. As\n          he presses it to Mathias's stump, Mathias finally passes out,\n          his body going slack, his screams falling SILENT.\n          For a long beat, there's just the SPITTING, SNAPPING sound of\n          Mathias's flesh being seared. Then Eric pulls back into a\n          crouch, shaking his head, looking utterly depleted.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Oh, Jesus.

A vine has come snaking into the clearing: it's\n          wrapping itself around one of the feet.\n          As the tendril begins to drag. the bones away, a.second one\n          slithers forward and lays claim to the other foot.\n          Eric grabs the knife, jumps up, steps on the first tendril,\n          bends to slash at it with the blade. He swoops toward the\n          second one. Even as he does so, though, a third tendril\n          slithers into the clearing, then a fourth.\n          Stacy SCREAMS again, short and loud, and backs toward the\n          tent; Eric bends and slashes, bends and slashes, and the'vine\n          keeps coming, from all directions, reaching for the bones.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Leave it.\n          Eric ignores him, cutting and stomping and tearing at the\n          tendrils, faster and faster, but still too slow, the vine\n          fighting back, wrapping itself around his legs.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Eric.\n          He steps toward him, grabs his arm, pulls him away. They\n          stand side by side, watching as the vine pulls the severed\n          limbs into itself, the white of the bones vanishing into the\n          larger mass of green. Stacy has begun to CRY again.\n          There's a beat of stillness, and then, once more, echoing up\n          toward them from the shaft, comes that faint electronic\n          RINGING of the cell phone.\n\n<b>          CU - THE WINDLASS\n</b>          Spinning, the rope spooling quickly off the barrel.\n\n<b>          JEFF (O.S.)\n</b>          I don't know how long it'11 burn--\n\n<b>          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          91.\n</b>\n<b>          EXT.

BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT - DAY\n</b>\n          A faint fall of light from above. There's the CREAKING of\n          the windlass: Amy is dropping slowly toward us. When her\n          feet touch the bottom of the shaft, she scrambles out of the\n          sling. Then she lifts her head, SHOUTS:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Pull it up!\n          The CREAKING resumes. She stands there in the dimness,\n          watching the sling rise away from her. She has the makeshift\n          torch in one hand, the box of matches in the other.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          95.\n</b>\n<b>          EXT.

Jeff waits beside the hand crank.\n\n<b>          THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT\n</b>          Amy is in a crouch. She keeps glancing toward the stone arch\n          cut into the shaft's wall, and the passageway beyond it: the\n          vine dangles from.the low ceiling, like streamers at a party.\n          The CREAKING resumes, and Amy looks up.\n\n<b>          AMY'S POV - ABOVE HER\n</b>          Stacy is dropping slowly toward us.\n\n<b>          BACK TO SCENE\n</b>          Amy glances toward the arch again. A slight draft blows\n          steadily from it, and the vine shifts and trembles in it. A\n          beat, then the RINGING starts up once more. It's coming from\n          within the shadowed passageway.\n          Amy opens the box of matches, plucks one out. She's too\n          jumpy, though; her hands are-trembling so much that she\n          shakes the match out as soon as it's lit.\n          There's a second RING. Stacy has nearly reached us.\n          Amy digs another match from the box. Stacy's feet touch the\n          bottom of the shaft; she yanks off the sling. There's a\n          third RING.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Hurry.\n          Amy strikes the match, holds it to the knot of clothing at\n          the end of the aluminum pole. The alcohol catches with a\n          FLUTTERING sound, a cloud of pale blue fire materializing\n          around the torch. Amy lifts it, and they start into:\n\n<b>          THE UNDERGROUND PASSAGE\n</b>          Stacy is in front, with Amy right behind her. The torch\n          shudders weakly in the steady draft; the shaft's ceiling is\n          low enough that they have to crouch as they move forward.\n          There's a fourth RING, drawing them deeper down the passage.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          96.\n</b>          The tendrils hanging from the ceiling brush against them.\n          The vine is growing on the floor, too--knee-deep--and from\n          the walls on either side. Amy is moving cautiously,\n          squinting into the darkness, and Stacy starts to pull ahead.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Wait...\n          She pauses, lifting the torch, but Stacy keeps going. Amy\n          peers at the vine hanging from the wall. There's a fifth\n          RING, echoing eerily, and the flowers move in exact unison\n          with the sound, their stamens vibrating, like so many\n          miniature tuning forks: the plant is making the noise.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Stacy...\n          The shaft dead-ends at a blank wall, which is just\n          materializing out of the darkness, fifteen feet in front of\n          them. There's a sixth RING. Stacy points at the wall,\n          quickening her pace.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          It's right here.

She WHISPERS:\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          There's no phone.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          What?\n          A seventh RING sounds, seeming to come from beneath the vines\n          on the floor of the shaft, directly in front of them. Stacy\n          tries to pull free, to bend and reach toward the sound.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          97.\n</b>          STACY (cont'd)\n          I can--\n          Amy jerks her back again, WHISPERS straight into her ear:\n\n<b>          ANY\n</b>          It's the vine. The flowers.\n          They're making the noise.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          No. It's--\n          She pulls free, steps forward, and her foot seems to punch\n          straight through the shaft's floor. She SCREAMS, losing her\n          balances Amy throws down the torch, lunges for her. The\n          torch flutters, pales, but remains lit.\n          The vines growing across the floor fall away, revealing an\n          opening, another shaft, dropping into the earth. Stacy is\n          slowly sliding into it, scrambling to stop herself.\n          Amy grabs Stacy arm. Stacy is dangling, from the waist down,\n          over the hole's edge. There are vines in the hole, too, and.\n          they begin to coil around her legs, pulling at her, dragging\n          her downward.\n          Stacy SCREAMS again, kicking to free herself, scrambling\n          upward, monkey-like, while Amy pulls at her, and finally they\n          manage to drag her to safety.\n          A beat, then Amy retrieves the torch, holds it out over the\n          hole. The bottom is twenty feet down, almost lost in shadow.\n          Dimly, WE SEE a woman, lying curled against the wall--she has\n          long dark hair.\n          STACY (cont'd)\n          Oh my God.\n          The woman stirs, her body rolling, as if to turn and look at\n          us, and WE SEE her face: she's a corpse. The vine has\n          invaded her flesh--it's in her eye sockets, the hollow of her\n          mouth, writhing and churning. Stacy and Amy SCREAM.\n          There's a WHISTLING sound, like a whip, and a tendril lashes\n          out from the shaft's wall, wraps itself around the torch's\n          handle, yanks it from Amy's grip. The torch falls into the\n          hole, still burning. When it hits bottom, a mass of vine\n          surges across it, smothering its flame.\n          It's very dark after this: Amy and Stacy are barely\n          discernible. A beat of silence, then an odd, high-pitched\n          CACKLING rises all around them; it sounds like laughter--\n          eerie, childlike, full of echoes.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          98.\n</b>          As it steadily increases in volume, that WHISTLING comes once\n          more: the vines SMACK at them from the floor, the ceiling,\n          the walls, coiling around their bodies, pulling them toward\n          the open shaft.\n          They both SCREAM again, scrambling backward, while the vine\n          keeps coming, more and more of it, grabbing at their arms,\n          their legs, their necks. They stumble over each other,\n          falling onto their hands and knees.amid the.tendrils.\n          The vine catches at them, tries to hold them down. It's not\n          strong enough, though; they yank it off, and thrash their\n          way, foot by foot, back toward the sling, the vine lashing at\n          them, grabbing, tearing, sap leaking onto their skin. The\n          laughter grows still louder, the whole shaft ECHOING with it.\n          Amy reaches the sling first, with Stacy right behind her.\n          Even here, the vine continues to attack them, whipping and\n          HISSING and LAUGHING. Amy holds the sling toward Stacy.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          You.\n          But Stacy is too hysterical: she just stands there, SOBBING,\n          SCREAMING. Jeff's voice comes toward them from above,\n\n<b>          SHOUTING:\n</b>\n<b>          JEFF (0.S.)\n</b>          Amoy...?\n          Amy pulls the sling over her own head.

Stacy returns the embrace, both of them\n          clutching at each other, as the windlass finally begins to\n          CREAK, lifting the two of them into the air.\n\n<b>          ON AMY AND STACY - IN THE SLING\n</b>          The vines hanging from the shaft's walls whip at the girls as\n          they rise, coiling around their bodies, pulling at them, that\n          strange LAUGHTER growing ever louder, seeming to buffet their\n          bodies.

THE HILL - DAY\n</b>\n          The SCREAM comes faintly toward us. The Mayans are arrayed\n          about their campsite, all of them motionless, silent, staring\n          up the hill with their impassive expressions.\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DUSK\n</b>\n          The weather has shifted; a wind has risen. The sun is\n          setting, a red smudge behind a dark gray wall of clouds.\n          Mathias lies.on his backboard, unconscious, his breathing\n          coming in that ragged RASP, a thread of brown liquid leaking\n          from the corner of his mouth. Amy is crouched beside him;\n          she leans forward, wipes away the liquid.\n          Stacy sits in the clearing behind her, leaning against Eric.\n          They're both slick with sweat, but Stacy keeps shivering, as\n          if cold. Eric's arms are around her, and her eyes are shut.\n          Jeff is peeling the orange. Like Amy, he's still spattered\n          and stained with Mathias's blood. The vine has continued to\n          grow on everyone's clothes, weblike, eating away at the\n          fabric. Jeff reaches, tugs free a strand of it, and a six-\n          inch tear appears in his T-shirt.\n          Stacy opens her eyes; she leans forward, peers down at the\n          wounds on her leg, her right hand moving to her chest,\n          probing at her rib cage. She turns to Eric:\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Check your phone.\n          Eric pushes himself to his feet, steps toward his pack. He\n          pulls out his phone, flips it open. He shakes his head.\n          STACY (cont'd)\n          Let me see.\n          Eric carries the phone to her, then stands over her while she\n          opens it, stares down at it. She shuts it, opens it again.\n          Then again, and again, and suddenly she's CRYING, bent into\n          herself. Eric drops to a crouch, rests his hand on her knee.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Shh.\n          But her crying increases; she begins to SOB. Jeff is bent'\n          over the orange, dividing it into four equal piles--its peel,\n          too--concentrating. He lifts his head, stares. Amy stands\n          up, hurries over., kneels in front of Stacy, takes her hand.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          100.\n</b>\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          It's okay, sweetie.

Amy struggles to calm her.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Stacy...\n          Stacy keeps WAILING, rocking, eyes shut. Amy leans in close.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Let's play the game...can you do\n          that? Huh? Can you give me a\n          \"So\"?\n          Stacy continues to CRY.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Come on. Just try. Can you try?\n          (a beat)\n          So there was this girl who wanted\n          to be a pilot.\n          Stacy's tears keep coming. Amy looks at Eric, gives him a\n          nod,'prodding him into speech. He hesitates, then:\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          But she was scared of heights.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          So she became a lifeguard instead.\n          (she squeezes Stacy's\n\n<b>          HAND)\n</b>          Come on. Your turn.\n          More SOBS. Amy glances across the clearing at Jeff, wanting\n          him to join in, too. It seems as if he might refuse, but\n          then her look hardens, and he relents.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          But she couldn't swim.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          101.\n</b>\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          So she wore a life vest.\n          (she squeezes Stacy's hand\n\n<b>          AGAIN)\n</b>          Come on. Now you.\n          A beat, then Stacy takes a deep, ragged breath. She wipes at\n          her face, struggles for words.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          But everyone...\n          She trails off, CRYING again. Amy nods, encouraging her.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Yeah...? Everyone what?\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          They laughed at her.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Good. That's good. So she--\n          Very suddenly, it starts to rain--a dozen large, heavy drops.\n          They all glance skyward.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>\n<b>          SHIT\u00c2\u0080\u00a2\n</b>          He springs to his feet. And then: a downpour, a deluge, as\n          if a trap door has swung open in the clouds. The rain falls\n          in a loud, drumming rush, turning the clearing to mud.\n          Eric jumps up, too. He and Jeff start digging through the\n          backpacks from the. blue tent, searching for something--\n          anything--in which to catch the water. They find a small\n          plastic bag, a nylon toiletry kit, a Frisbee. Jeff sets\n          these in a row on the ground, open to the rain.\n          Eric rushes to the orange tent, vanishes inside. Amy tilts\n          back her head, tries to catch the rain in her open mouth.\n          Stacy just sits there, hugging herself, shivering, still half-\n          crying. They're all drenched, back-spattered with mud.\n          And then, as abruptly as it had begun, the rain starts to\n          slacken. Eric reemerges from the orange tent, carrying a\n          thermos, a plastic cup. He sets them next to the other\n          containers, but it's pointless; the rain is already stopping.\n          They all stare at these meager receptacles: they've managed\n          to catch less than half an inch of muddy-looking water. Jeff.\n          GROANS; he's FURIOUS with himself:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          102.\n</b>          JEFF (cont'd)\n          We should've been ready.

Amy jumps up.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>\n<b>          JEFFT\n</b>          She steps forward, as if to guard the other containers.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          It doesn't fucking matter.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          There was water in it.\n          He spins toward her, turning his fury with himself on her:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          How much, Amy? Two and a half\n          gallons? 'Cause that's what we\n          need. For today--just to make it\n          through today. And then tomorrow\n          the same all over again. And for\n          how long? Another week before our\n          parents start searching? And then\n          what? How long till they track us\n          to Coba? Or to this fucking hill?\n          How long will it take, Amy?\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          You said--\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          It's not gonna happen. We're not\n          gonna make it.\n          The others stare at him in astonishment, too 'stunned to\n          speak. He gives them all a look of disgust:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          And you're fucking playing games.\n          (mimicking Amy's voice)\n          So there were these people trapped\n          in the jungle.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Don't, Jeff.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          But they didn't have any water.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          103.\n</b>          Amy looks as if she might start crying.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Please, don't.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          So they're gonna die of thirst.\n          Amy covers her ears with her hands.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Shut up!\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          But this fucking vine might kill\n          them first.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>\n<b>          (SHOUTING)\n</b>\n<b>          STOP IT!\n</b>          Jeff paces away, struggling to regain control of himself. A\n          long beat, and then, very QUIETLY:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          I'm sorry ...I'm sorry.\n          He steps back toward the dismembered orange, crouches over\n          it. The fruit and peels are muddy now, spoiled looking. He\n          waves for the others to approach.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Come on. We need to eat.\n          No one moves. They're all staring at him with their shocked\n          expressions. He can't seem to meet their eyes. He gestures\n          at the orange again.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          The peel, too. Everything.\n          Abeat, then the others step forward to claim their portions:\n          first Eric, then Stacy, then Amy. They eat without speaking.\n          Finally, almost AS IF TALKING TO HIMSELF:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          It'll rain again. It has to. And\n          we'll figure out a way to catch it.\n          (he nods to himself)\n          We'll be fine. We'll ration the\n          -food.

Just water, a little bit\n          of water. So why not us?\n          No one responds. They continue to eat: the fruit, the\n          peels. Their torn clothes cling wetly to them. Jeff uncaps\n          the water bottle, offers it to Amy. She drinks, passes it\n          on. It moves around the circle, back to Jeff.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          What about the vine?\n          Jeff takes his sip, caps the bottle. He's reclaiming\n          himself, his voice strengthening, his confidence returning.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          I don't think it can hurt us.

Then:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          It's not strong enough to overpower\n          us. And it--\n          Mathias GASPS suddenly, his entire body spasming for a\n          moment, before the watery RASP of his breathing resumes. He\n          doesn't regain consciousness; his eyes remain shut. Everyone\n          watches him for a beat: he, also, is spattered with mud.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          He's gonna die, isn't he? if\n          there's no phone, then there's no--\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Me, too.\n          They all turn to look at her.

Just like him.\n          And her.\n          She waves toward the shaft. Jeff gives her a weary look.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Don't, Stacy.

The\n          knife is lying in the mud beside him, and Stacy steps\n          forward, snatches it up. Jeff reaches to stop her, but he's\n          too slow. She stands before him, hefting it. in her hand.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Put it down.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I'll show you.\n          She lifts her.shirt again, pressing at her rib cage with her\n          .fingertips.

She watches it, frowning.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I thought it would just come\n          tumbling out.\n          She probes at the cut with the point of the knife, prying it\n          farther open, the bleeding increasing. Jeff reaches, grabs\n          the knife from her. He looks furious:\n\n<b>          JEFF .\n</b>          Sit down.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          It's hiding.

He lowers his finger.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Have you made it up with her?\n          Amy half-nods, half-shrugs.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Good.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          But I want to tell you--\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          117.\n</b>          He presses his finger to her lips again, stopping her. He\n          waits a beat, and then:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          I wish it mattered.\n          Amy gives him a confused look. Jeff throws out his hand,.\n          gesturing at the hilltop, the vine, their tattered clothes.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Look at us.\n          (a beat)\n          Would it matter to you?\n          Amy hesitates, considering. Then she shakes her head. And\n          with that, Jeff turns, starts back toward the orange tent.\n          WE HEAR a zipping sound, which carries over into:\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          Jeff is crouched beside the backboard, UNZIPPING the sleeping\n          bag. Eric tosses the flimsy lean-to aside, exposing\n          Mathias's corpse-to the sun. Amy and Stacy stand watching.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Head first?\n          Eric considers this, staring down at Mathias's body.\n          Mathias's face is burned red from the vine's sap; his legs\n          are two blackened stumps. Eric shrugs.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          I guess.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          You'll have to lift him.\n          Eric hesitates; he seems reluctant to touch the corpse.\n          Finally, he girds himself, straddles the backboard, grabs\n          Mathias under his armpits, lifting him. Jeff leans forward,\n          starts to pull the sleeping bag over Mathias's head.\n          The corpse seems intent upon resisting them; its arms keep\n          getting tangled, catching and snagging. Jeff and Eric have\n          to wrestle with it, both of them PANTING, sweating, before\n          they manage to shove it into the bag.\n          Jeff ZIPS the bag shut, and they stand over it, catching\n          their breath, wiping the perspiration from their faces.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          Should we say something?\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          118.\n</b>          Jeff gives him a blank stare.\n          ERIC (cont'd)\n          Like, you know ...a prayer?\n          Jeff frowns down at the bag, searching for words. Before he\n          can find them, Stacy speaks:\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Where's the knife?\n          They all turn. Her hand is under her tattered shirt,\n          pressing at her lower back. Jeff SIGHS:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>\n<b>          STACY--\n</b>          She lifts her shirt, twisting to show him. it looks as if a\n          large starfish has been implanted just beneath her skin.\n          It's moving, too, inching slowly but visibly downward. They\n          all stare in astonishment.\n          Amy GASPS, points at Stacy's leg. Stacy bends to see:\n          there's more vine here, a snakelike lump winding its way\n          upward from the top of her shin to her inner thigh.\n\n<b>          CU - FIRE\n</b>          Another small pile of clothes, burning with that blue,\n          alcohol-fueled flame.\n\n<b>          AMY (O.S.)\n</b>          Can I give her some?\n          The knife is placed in the fire, and WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          Amy holds up the bottle of tequila. Jeff is crouching over\n          the fire, heating the knife's blade. Be glances toward her,\n          nods. Stacy is sitting down, staring at the bulge in her leg\n          with a dazed expression. Eric is beside her.\n          Amy offers the bottle to Stacy;-they all watch as she takes a\n          long swallow. Then she hands the bottle back to Amy, and\n          Jeff pulls the knife from the fire, carries it toward her.\n          He gestures to Eric and Amy.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Hold her hands.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          119.\n</b>          They each take one of her hands. Jeff crouches over her leg.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          You might want to shut your eyes.\n          Stacy shakes her head.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          I want to see.\n          Jeff hesitates; for a moment it seems-as if he might argue.\n          But then, very quickly, he leans forward and draws the knife\n          in one smooth movement up and around Stacy's leg. Stacy\n          MOANS, her body tensing, but she doesn't cry out.\n          The incision reveals the vine, a foot long, its leaves and\n          flowers clotted with Stacy's blood, which is oozing from the\n          wound. Jeff reaches in, pries the tendril from her flesh.\n          Stacy MOANS again, arching backward, as the vine emerges:\n          writhing and twisting. The blood comes more thickly now,\n          pumping from the wound, running down her leg.\n          Jeff drops the tendril into the dirt, steps on it, grinding\n          it into stillness. Stacy is breathing HARD, almost\n          hyperventilating. She's shut her eyes.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Should I stop?\n          Stacy shakes her head, vehemently. Jeff glances at the\n          others. Eric shakes his head, too. Amy's eyes, like\n          Stacy's, are tightly shut.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          You'll have to roll over.\n          Stacy lets go of the others' hands, rolls onto her stomach.\n          She hitches up her shirt, revealing the small of her back,\n          the starfish-shaped bulge. Jeff crouches at her side.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Ready?\n          She nods, and he leans, makes five quick incisions, in the\n          shape of an asterisk, directly above the bulge. Stacy's body\n          goes rigid, and Eric takes her hand again. Once more, we can\n          see the tendril through the incision: dark with her blood.\n          Jeff reaches in and slowly pulls the vine from her body.\n          There's an astonishing amount of it; he has to drop the knife\n          and use both hands to drag the slimy mass free.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          120.\n</b>          As the plant emerges from her body--thrashing, coiling and\n          uncoiling, covered in half-clotted blood, like a newborn--\n          Stacy starts to SCREAM.\n\n<b>          EXT. CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY\n</b>\n          The Mayans at their campsite: three of them on guard duty,\n          the others napping in the shade beneath the trees. Stacy's\n          SCREAMING echoes down the hill toward us.\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          They've pulled a shirt from one of the backpacks, torn it\n          into strips, and used these to bandage Stacy's wounds, tying\n          them around her leg and torso. She's lying on her side, eyes\n          shut, her head in Eric's lap. He's stroking her hair.\n          Jeff is counting the grapes into four separate piles. Amy\n          sits watching him. When he finishes, he gestures for her to\n          take a pile. Then he scoops Stacy and Eric's rations up,\n          carries them over.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Can you eat?\n          Stacy sits up, wincing; her bandages are soaked through with\n          blood. She takes the grapes from him; Eric does, too. They-\n          all begin to eat, in silence. When they're done, Jeff passes\n          the water bottle around their circle. Then:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          We should try to rest, I guess.\n          (he waves toward the tent)\n          Get out of the sun. We're losing\n          moisture out--\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          There's more of it.\n          She leans forward, probes at her right thigh, prodding the\n          skin. The others watch her; there's no bulge visible, no\n          sign of the vine-at all. Eric gives her a pained look.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          There's nothing there, Stacy.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          It's under the muscle.

Right here.\n          She uses her finger to draw a line up her thigh.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          You're losing too much blood.

Again, there's no visible sign of the vine.\n          He shakes his head.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          No more cutting. Not unless---\n          The knife is in the dirt beside him, and Stacy leans forward,\n          tries to grab it. Jeff is too quick for her, though: he\n          snatches it up, tucks it into his belt. Stacy is becoming\n          more and more upset. She holds out her hands, BEGGING:\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          Please, Jeff.\n\n<b>          ERIC\n</b>          You can't.

Amy\n          strokes her. Eric steps across the clearing, picks up the\n          bottle of tequila. He glances at Jeff, and Jeff nods.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          You're scared, honey. You're just\n          scared. You know?\n          Stacy nods; she's still CRYING, but it's growing quieter.\n          Eric crouches beside her, holds out the bottle of tequila.\n          Stacy just stares at it. Amy encourages her:\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          It'll help.\n          Stacy accepts the bottle, takes a long swallow. Then\n          another. The others watch her in silence. Finally:\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Can you rest some? In the tent?\n          Stacy is silent. She wipes the tears from her face.\n\n<b>          STACY\n</b>          That girl--\n          (she waves at the shaft)\n          I keep seeing her.

Then she reaches, grasps\n          her hand. Amy pulls her to her feet, helps her hobble across\n          the clearing to the tent. Jeff and Eric sit-there, watching\n          in silence as they vanish through the flap.\n\n<b>          INT. ORANGE TENT - DAY\n</b>\n          Sunlight filters through the orange nylon; all four of them\n          lie sleeping in a row, sweating. The vine has shredded their\n          clothes to tatters; they look like castaways. The tent's\n          flap hangs open, billowing gently in a slight breeze.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          123.\n</b>          Stacy open her eyes. She lies there, staring up toward the\n          orange nylon above her. The blood on her bandages has dried\n          to a dark red, bordering on black. She sits up, stares about\n          the tent. Eric is on one side of her, then Amy, then Jeff.\n          Jeff is on his back, the knife still tucked into his belt.\n          Stacy rises quietly, steps over Amy, crouches above him,\n          staring down at the knife. She reaches, tries to slip it\n          free, but then jerks back when Jeff shifts in his sleep.\n          She hesitates, watching him. She seems as if she's about to\n          try again, but then the tent flap billows in the breeze,\n          drawing her gaze. A beat, and she rises, steps carefully\n          over Jeff, ducks outside into the clearing.\n\n<b>          EXT. HILLTOP - THE CLEARING - DAY\n</b>\n          Stacy stands just beyond the tent's.flap. All is still,\n          quiet.- She moves to Eric's pack, crouches over it, pulls out\n          his phone. She flips it open, stares down at its screen:\n          there's still no signal. She drops it back into the pack.\n          She turns-to examine the clearing, her eyes falling upon the\n          two backpacks from the blue tent. Their pockets are zippered\n          open: Jeff and Eric's hurried pillaging during the downpour\n          has scattered their contents across the dirt.\n          Stacy rises, steps toward this tangled mound. She starts to\n          dig through it, casually at first, but then with growing\n          intensity, throwing T-shirts and jeans and shorts aside,\n          probing deeply into the pile.\n          Suddenly she goes still. Staring. Amid the sodden mass of\n          clothing sits a knife in a small scabbard.\n          As Stacy crouches there, the vines start to RUSTLE, a\n          rippling motion passing across them, as. if a wind were\n          sweeping the hillside. Stacy watches with a look of horror:\n          it looks like the pelt of some giant animal, shaking itself.\n          When it finally stops, she bends, reaching for the knife.\n\n<b>          INT.

Then the sound of WHIMPERING.\n          Eric opens his eyes, listening. An instant later, very\n          abruptly, there comes a sharp, rending SCREAM of pure pain.\n          Eric jumps up, starts for the flap; Jeff is right behind him.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          124.\n</b>\n<b>          EXT.

She's pulled off\n          her shirt, her shorts, and has cut much of the skin from her\n          body. She doesn't notice them.

But the knife is in her hand, and it punches into his\n          chest, just to the right of his sternum, sticking there.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          125.\n</b>          Eric looks at the knife in surprise.

A half dozen tendrils are snaking into the clearing,\n          reaching toward Eric's body.\n          Jeff jumps to his feet. The tendrils begin to wrap\n          themselves around Eric's limbs, and Jeff bends to tear them\n          away. More and more keep coming, though. Eric has started\n          to convulse, GAGGING, his head cocked back.\n          Jeff keeps yanking the tendrils away, but there are far too\n          many of them; they coil around Eric's legs, pulling at him.\n          The blood has stopped pumping from his wound; his body has\n          gone still.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          Jeff I\n          She points toward the tent.

I'm--\n          He UNZIPS the bag, and an immense tangle of vine cascades out\n          onto the dirt. Its flowers are a pale pink; they're opening\n          and closing, still calling, louder now:\n\n<b>          MATHIAS' S VOICE\n</b>\n<b>          HENRICH...!

He has a bloody strip\n          of fabric tied around the wound on his hand.\n          Amy watches as he arranges the food in front of her. She's\n          CRYING silently, tears running down her dirt-smeared cheeks.\n          Jeff peels one of the bananas: it's dark brown, far too\n          ripe. He holds it out to her. She just stares at it.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          Come on. You'll need the energy.\n          He reaches for her hand, puts the banana in it.

Amy squints toward it for a\n          beat, and then, almost despite herself, lifts the banana to\n          her mouth. She bites, chews, swallows, still mutely crying.\n          Jeff peels the second banana; he hands it to her as soon as\n          she finishes the first. Be watches her eat,.silent.

It's joined by a\n          second tendril, then a third, a fourth;.the vines coil around\n          Stacy's body, begin to drag it from the clearing. Amy's\n          CRYING grows more forceful, her body shaking.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Shh.\n          Jeff reaches, strokes her. The vine pulls Stacy's body into\n          itself, burying it. Amy watches, struggling to control.\n          herself. Her voice emerges as little more than a WHISPER:\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          I don't want to. I don't...\n          She shakes her head, wipes at her face: the tears, the snot,\n          the sweat, the dirt. Her clothes are falling off her body,\n          eaten to shreds. Jeff's, too.\n          AMY (cont'd)\n          Why can't we both?\n          Jeff hesitates a.beat. Then, clearly not believing it:\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          We might.\n          He hands her the pretzels; she takes them, watching his face.\n\n<b>          AMY\n</b>          How?\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          It'll take them a moment to react.\n          If I can make it to the trees...\n          He trails off, shrugs. Amy keeps staring at him; she doesn't\n          believe this either. He SIGHS again, holds up his hand,\n          pulls the bandage from his wound: it's three inches long, a\n          deep gash into his palm.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          How long till it's inside me?\n          Amy is silent. He flexes his hand, and the wound opens,\n          mouthlike, blood oozing thickly from it.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          It already is, probably. I'll be\n          just like Stacy soon.\n          He turns, glances toward the spot where her body has\n          disappeared. Amy looks, too.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          130.\n</b>          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Then what?

He waves for her to keep eating,\n          and she starts in on the pretzels, mechanically. He opens\n          the can of Coke, hands it to her; she takes a long sip.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Once you're in the jungle, you drop\n          and hide.\n          Another tendril slithers forward. It slips into the immense\n          puddle of blood beside Jeff and Amy, begins to drink it.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          They'll never find you--it's too\n          thick in there. Just burrow down,\n          and they'll run right past.\n          Jeff opens the can of nuts, sets it in front of Amy. Then he\n          gets up, crouches over the puddle of blood. He cups. his\n          hands, dips them into the puddle. He steps toward Amy,\n          smears the blood across her T-shirt.

Then\n          another step, and listen again.\n          He moves back to the puddle, which the lone tendril continues'\n          to drain. He cups his hands, scoops up more blood, smears it\n          on her tattered khakis. Amy has finished the pretzels; she\n          reaches for the nuts, looking numb..\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          East, always east--keep the sun at\n          your back.\n          He scoops up more blood from the puddle.\n          JEFF (cont'd)'\n          Arms.\n          Amy holds out her arms, and he smears the blood on them.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          You'll hear me yell.

CLEARING/BASE OF THE HILL - DAY\n</b>\n          Three of the Mayan men, as usual, sit in the clearing, bows\n          in their laps, facing the hill. The others are sheltering\n          from the sun in the line of shade along the jungle's margin,\n          some sleeping, some talking quietly together.\n          One of the men in the clearing suddenly rises to his feet,\n          nocking an arrow. The other two also rise. The Mayans along\n          the clearing fall silent, staring up the hill.\n\n<b>          THE MAYANS' POV - UP THE HILL\n</b>          Jeff is approaching down the trail, carrying Amy, pieta-like,\n          in his arms.

They join the other three Mayans in\n          the center of the clearing. They all watch as Jeff reaches\n          the base of the trail, where he carefully lays Amy down.\n          Jeff crouches over Amy, laying her arms across her chest,\n          pushing the hair from her face. He bends, kisses her blood-\n          smeared forehead. Then he glances up at the Mayans.\n\n<b>          JEFF\n</b>          You don't even know her name.\n          The Mayans just stare at him.

Jeff smiles, taps his sternum.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Jeff. Understand? My name's Jeff.\n          He edges along the clearing's margin, keeping close to the\n          vines, moving away from Amy's body. The Mayans follow him,\n          weapons raised. After a handful of steps, he stops again,\n          turns toward them.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Can you say it? Huh?\n          Again, the Mayans just stare. He SLAPS at his chest.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          Jeff.\n          A beat, then he suddenly YELLS, waving the knife at the men.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n\n<b>          SAY MY FUCKING NAME!\n</b>          Silence.

And Eric.\n          Mathias. And Henrich. You've\n          killed them all.\n          He steps toward them. The bald man raises his hand, holds it\n          up, palm out, next to his pistol.

Several of the other Mayans have emerged\n          from the jungle; they stand there watching.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          133.\n</b>          JEFF (cont'd)\n          One of us is gonna survive. You\n          should know that name, too. You\n          fuckers. You bastards.\n          He takes yet another step forward. The bald man speaks a\n          string of words IN MAYAN, with an edge of warning. More\n          Mayans emerge from-the jungle, shielding their eyes against\n          the sun, staring. No one is looking in Amy's direction.\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          It's not Jeff.\n          He shakes his head, his voice dropping, almost to a WHISPER:\n          JEFF .(cont'd)\n          It's not me.\n          He takes another step. And then, still QUIETLY:\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n          It's Amy. You hear?\n          He takes a deep breath, gathering himself. Then he YELLS--\n          JEFF (cont'd)\n\n<b>          AMY;\n</b>          --and starts to run, straight at the Mayans. He only manages\n          three steps before the bald man FIRES his pistol, and the\n          others let their arrows fly.\n          The bullet hits Jeff in the chest, just beneath his throat.\n          One of the arrows misses; the other three strike his stomach,\n          his left arm, his right thigh. Before he even hits the\n          ground, there's a SHOUT from the Mayans along the treeline.\n          The bald man turns. Amy is on her feet, sprinting for the\n          jungle. The bald man raises. his pistol, FIRES, but the shot\n          is too hurried; it goes wide. The others are still\n          scrambling for fresh arrows as she vanishes into the trees.\n          The bowmen sprint after her, disappearing into the jungle,\n          leaving the bald man alone in the clearing with Jeff. The\n          Mayan women stand motionless along the treeline, staring.\n          after Amy: they look mortified, grief-stricken.\n          Jeff is bleeding heavily from his wounds, struggling to crawl\n          forward, his breath frothing pinkly at his lips. A half\n          dozen tendrils slither into the clearing. They coil around\n          his legs, start to drag him back toward the hill. Jeff\n          fights them, kicking, MOANING, bleeding.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          134.\n</b>          The bald man watches.

He hands it to Teresa.\n          DOCTOR (cont'd)\n          Her clothes were torn; she was\n          covered in blood. But not her own.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          135.\n</b>          Teresa stares down at the photo: it shows Amy on a gurney,\n          unconscious, blood-smeared, corpse-like.\n\n<b>          TERESA\n</b>          Now do you know?\n\n<b>          DOCTOR\n</b>          She has no wounds.\n          A uniformed policeman sits on a chair outside one of the\n          rooms at the end of the corridor, reading a newspaper. He\n          rises as they approach. Teresa hands the printout back to\n          the doctor; she keeps the passport.\n\n<b>          TERESA\n</b>          That's it? That's all you have?\n\n<b>          DOCTOR\n</b>          I'm afraid so.\n          Be nods to the policeman, and leads Teresa into:\n\n<b>          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n          A bed, a night stand, a curtained window. Amy lies with a\n          sheet pulled to her chin, unconscious, an IV dripping into\n          her arm. They've cleaned the blood off her.\n          A NURSE sits in a chair beside the bed. She's in her early\n          twenties, with long dark hair tied in a bun. She stands up,\n          stepping back from the bed, as the doctor and Teresa enter.\n          The doctor addresses her in SUBTITLED SPANISH:\n\n<b>          DOCTOR\n</b>          Has she stirred?\n          The nurse shakes her head. The doctor moves to the bed. He\n          takes Amy's wrist, feeling for her-pulse. Amy's eyes open at\n          his touch. She stares at him, her arm hanging limply in his\n          grasp. He smiles down at her.\n\n          DOCTOR (cont'd)\n          There you are...\n          Teresa steps forward, and Amy's gaze shifts to her.\n\n          DOCTOR (cont'd)\n          My name is Dr. Hernandez...\n\n          Amy's eyes return to the doctor;. they fall on his face, then\n          drift down to his chest. The doctor gestures toward Teresa:\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          136.\n</b>\n          DOCTOR (cont'd)\n          And this is Ms. Bern, from the U.S.\n          Consulate.\n          Amy is staring at his white coat, her expression going slack,\n          almost catatonic, all the life draining from it.\n\n          DOCTOR (cont'd)\n          we were hoping you might be able to\n          shed a little light on what you've\n          been through...\n\n          Amy is silent, still staring with that dead look in her eyes\n          at the doctor's coat: a faint green web of vine has taken\n          root there, spreading across the white fabric. WE HOLD on it\n          for a beat, and then:\n\n\n\n<b>          THE END\n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Ruins,-The.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Ruins, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Scott Smith\" title=\"Scripts by Scott Smith\">Scott Smith</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Ruins, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Ruins, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:15:06.439154"}
