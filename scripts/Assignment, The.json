We should be unsure of what \n               we are looking at. Is it the surface of the moon or some \n               primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash? Just then a liquid \n               with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice \n               and further divides the screen in two, like a river border \n               dividing East from West perhaps.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray gulch \n               filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a Parisian \n               street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle of \n               the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little \n               boys, who are peeing on the pavement, laughing at their \n               mischief. The boys are twins. They wear backpacks and are \n               set to go off to school. Just then we HEAR the voice of a \n               WOMAN shouting in French (with English subtitles).\n\n                                     FRENCH WOMAN (O.S.)\n                         What do you think you're going?! You \n                         ought to be ashamed behaving like \n                         that!\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal ever more scenes of life \n               on this particular street. The woman shouts at the children \n               from her window and the children run off. At the corner, \n               fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe, as chairs \n               are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are \n               preparing for their morning clientele.\n\n               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal a taxi driver arguing \n               with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and \n               set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the \n               city over Montmartre, picking up an argument between two \n               drivers here, fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over \n               there. Chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the \n               city awakens and we float across Montmartre into a small \n               residential quarter. Husbands kiss wives who send school \n               children on their way as TITLES CONTINUE and the city comes \n               more and more to life and we hover across a small square \n               just up from the Place de la Opera, not far from the Boulevard \n               Saint Germain-des-Pres, with Montmartre in the b.g. The square \n               has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula \n               of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel, \n               whose shuttered windows overlook the square. As we pull back \n               and back over the small square, we literally...\n\n               SFX SHOT\n\n               ...Pull backwards through the slats of the shutter, going \n               from an aerial shot, being sucked in through the semi-closed \n               shutters into a hotel room where we continue ever so slowly, \n               pulling back.\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING\n\n               The first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear \n               seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the \n               preceding scene, is a spider-web. We are TIGHT on the web in \n               which a still-living insect struggles against his silky bonds. \n               The web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops, \n               spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim, \n               soon to be lunch. As the spider makes this journey we become \n               aware in the b.g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking. It is \n               a woman's breathless sighs and gasps we hear, but under that, \n               perhaps a man's voice, perhaps not. The sounds build to a \n               climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers \n               the glistening body of a beautiful young Parisian woman in \n               post-coital dewy Nirvana. Then, the figure of a nude man in \n               silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered \n               window. His face and body are half-lit by the slats of light \n               that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room. He \n               lights a cigarette.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE ON - CLOSE ON THE MAN\n\n               whom we will come to know as CARLOS. He lights the cigarette \n               and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his \n               lungs, glancing out at the street and alternately at the \n               spider who tiptoes down to her prey. He watches the spider \n               envelop the still-living victim with her spindly legs. Then \n               he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows \n               bright, a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to \n               the spider's body. It sizzles.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (whispering to the \n                              burnt spider)\n                         You lose...\n\n               He looks out through the shutters at the digital clock across \n               the square. Then he glances back at the girl whom we will \n               call COLETTE. The conversation is in French with English \n               subtitles.\n\n                                     COLETTE\n                         What do you mean?\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         I mean get out.\n\n                                     COLETTE\n                         You're a pig, you know that? How can \n                         you be like that?\n\n               Carlos crosses to her slowly. He runs his hand across her \n               cheek, then down across her throat. Death is in his eyes.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (barely above a whisper)\n                         Leave without saying another word.\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - HOTEL - DAY\n\n               Carlos stands in front of the mirror. The mirror is cracked \n               and in it we see the fractured face of Carlos staring back \n               at us from opposite sides of the cracked glass. He wears \n               surgical gloves. From a make up kit by the side of the sink \n               he removes a piece of false hair and spirit gum as TITLES \n               CONTINUE.\n\n               A. Carlos affixes a John Lennon mustache.\n\n               B. Carlos puts on a brown wig of moderately longish hair \n               such as one might have seen on a student in Paris in the \n               early seventies.\n\n               C. Carlos puts on a pair of John Lennon granny glasses and \n               the student look is complete.\n\n               D. Carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans \n               and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket. \n               He now looks every inch the young French student dressing \n               down to look like one of the proletariat.\n\n               END OF TITLES\n\n               E. Carlos takes an M26 hand grenade and puts it into an inside \n               pocket of his coat. He puts a machine pistol and snaps its \n               ammo clip into it and puts it in his student's shoulder bag \n               and then takes a Walther PPK and places it in his jeans at \n               the small of his back. All the while that he is doing these \n               things he sings: \"ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE.\"\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (singing)\n                         All you need is love... \n                         Rum da, da da da \n                         All you need is love \n                         Rum da da da da \n                         All you need is lo-ve \n                         Love is all you need. \n                         Love is all you need.\n\n               SUPERIMPOSED: Paris, September 15, 1974.\n\n               EXT. / INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY\n\n               It's a hot Sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a \n               cafe in St. Germain-des-Pres is bustling with young clientele. \n               Inside the cafe, there is a second floor with a balustrade \n               overlooking the tables inside. Outside, there are tables set \n               up on the sidewalk.\n\n               JACK SHAW, a tall, husky American in his late thirties, sits \n               at one of the front tables outside. He reads the International \n               Herald Tribune. The headline is, \"Terrorists Seize Embassy, \n               Issue Demands And Threaten Attacks.\" Jack sips his espresso.\n\n               ANGLE ON CARLOS\n\n               dressed as in preceding scene. He enters. Just then Jack \n               looks up and sees him. For an instant, Carlos looks at Jack, \n               tenses just slightly. Jack looks back at his paper paying no \n               attention. Carlos pulls out a cigarette, pats his pockets \n               for a light. Then he crosses to Jack.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Pardon monsieur...\n\n               He mimes flicking a match and Jack looks for a match. He's \n               out. He offers the lit end of his cigarette. Carlos cups \n               Jack's hand.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Merci.\n\n               He crosses away from Jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. \n               Jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through \n               the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by \n               reflections of the street. Carlos steps casually to the \n               railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double \n               image of Carlos and the reflected street scene. Carlos leans \n               over, pulls the pin from an M26 grenade, and lets the \"spoon\" \n               come off in his hand. We HEAR the timing fuse hiss as Carlos \n               nonchalantly counts to himself.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (counting)\n                         One thousand one... one thousand \n                         two... one thousand three...\n\n               ANGLE ON - JACK\n\n               He looks up just in time to see Carlos drop the grenade \n               casually into the crowd below. Their eyes lock for a beat; \n               then Carlos smiles, turns and bounds away. Jack's eyes widen \n               in horror. He gets up, about to cry out a warning.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               ANGLE ON\n\n               the crowd below as the grenade EXPLODES, filling the air \n               with smoke and flying glass, its metal ripping through flesh \n               and bone. People are wounded, bloody and writhing in pain \n               and screaming in panic.\n\n               ANGLE ON JACK\n\n               disheveled, covered with the shattered glass of the window, \n               but not but not seriously hurt, he struggles to his feet. He \n               looks around for Carlos who has vanished, now realizing who \n               he was. As he looks around, he sees a SMALL BOY staring at \n               his left arm with heart-rending disbelief.\n\n               The boy has no hand.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

ENTRANCE HALL - GROUND FLOOR\n\n               The group with the Adidas sport bags approaches the reception \n               desk. Carlos -- moustache, sideburns, and wispy beard in \n               reddish brown -- smiles politely at the female RECEPTIONIST. \n               Behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which \n               wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the \n               railing at the top of the landing. There is what appears to \n               be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece \n               and tell-tale bulge under his jacket.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (in German)\n                         Pardon me. Is the conference still \n                         in progress?\n\n               Smiling back, the ash-blonde receptionist nods.\n\n                                     RECEPTIONIST\n                              (in German)\n                         Yes, but sir...\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (in German)\n                         I have an urdent delivery for the \n                         ministers.\n\n               As if on urgent business, Carlos quickly heads up the flight \n               of stairs before the security man who stands next to the \n               receptionist can react. The security man speaks quickly into \n               his walkie talkie.\n\n               ANGLE ON - THE LANDING\n\n               by the elevator at the top of the stairs. Carlos bounds up \n               the stairs and pushes the elevator button. The Security Man \n               near the elevator listens intently to what is being said in \n               his earpiece and he steps forward to challenge Carlos. Carlos \n               smiles at him and whips out a 9mm. silenced Beretta and fires \n               two shots right between the Security Man's eyes. He falls \n               over the railing and lands face up on the console in front \n               of the terrified receptionist. Carlos leans over the rail in \n               one move and fires two shots into the upturned face of the \n               Security Man who stands next to the shocked receptionist. \n               The receptionist screams.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

That is, with the \n               exception of TWO BODYGUARDS. They try for their weapons. A \n               short burst from Carlos' Beretta machine pistol which is \n               pulled from the inside of his trenchcoat brings them to the \n               floor. This weapon is not silenced, but deafening. Just then \n               Koj enters the room from the corridor.\n\n                                     KOJ\n                         We've got company.\n\n               Suddenly, there's the sound of INTENSE GUNFIRE coming from \n               the corridor.\n\n               ANGLE ON - CARLOS\n\n               He reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a pocket-sized \n               Chinese RGD5 grenade. He yanks the pin, lets the spoon fly, \n               listens to the fuse hiss, counts quite calmly and then tosses \n               the live grenade to Koj who catches it and in one movement \n               tosses it out the door. A loud sound of GRENADE EXPLOSION, \n               and plaster powders those glued to the floor. GASPS OF TERROR. \n               But the gunfire outside ceases.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         My name is Carlos.

MEN'S ROOM - VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT\n\n               Jack stands inside of a stall in the men's room. He has just \n               crossed a certain frontier in his mind and stepped in to the \n               area known as no man's land. He quickly takes off his overcoat \n               and jacket and we SEE attached to his arm a harness made up \n               of straps and springs. He opens his briefcase and attaches \n               to the harness a .32 caliber Beretta. He fumbles with the \n               adjustments, racing against time. Finally, he seems to have \n               adjusted everything just so. Then he lowers his arm to his \n               side. Then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands and \n               the harness slams the .32 caliber Beretta from his forearm \n               straight into his palm.\n\n               He resets the gun back into the forearm position. He has a \n               look of grim determination on his face. The only question \n               is, is it the look of someone who is crazy enough to do what \n               he is contemplating.\n\n               EXT. VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - BLIZZARD - NIGHT\n\n               On the tarmac, an Austrian Airways DC9. TV cameras, lights, \n               generators are set up in front of the plane, sending beams \n               and pools of yellow light into the darkness and the snow \n               which swirls all around as a pool of REPORTERS stands ready \n               to record whatever is about to go down. Among a small group \n               of OFFICIALS is Jack Shaw. Everyone's eyes are on an \n               approaching yellow curtained bus.\n\n               ON BUS\n\n               As it gets closer, we can detect through its windshield a \n               white raincoat and a black beret. Carlos is standing by the \n               driver with a machine-pistol in one hand and a grenade in \n               the other.\n\n               CLOSE - JACK\n\n               His eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist, his \n               arm down at his side.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               As the bus parks by the DC 9, Carlos jumps out and waves to \n               the media. Not the customary V-sign, but the wave of a \n               celebrity... The hostages then, under their captors' guns, \n               file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane. A line \n               of exhausted, bleary-eyed middle-aged men in expensive suits \n               and in need of a shave. Carlos however, is as fresh, alert \n               and energetic as the morning of the attack. And he's \n               definitely savoring the moment.\n\n               ON JACK\n\n               Tense, he tries to be inconspicuous as he leans towards \n               Mickens.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (whispering)\n                         I think it's him, but I can't be \n                         sure. Not with those dark glasses \n                         and the beard...\n\n               ON CARLOS\n\n               Everyone on board, he too climbs the mobile steps and \n               disappears into the plane. Suddenly, he reemerges and comes \n               down to where the officials and Jack stand. As Jack watches \n               him intently, he faces the MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. In the \n               window of the plane we SEE Koj holding a grenade to the \n               pilot's head.\n\n               ANGLE ON CARLOS\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Minister of the Interior, I \n                         presume...?\n\n               The distinguished-looking man, who looks a bit like Kurt \n               Waldheim, nods.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         I'm sorry this had to happen in \n                         Austria. We have no quarrel with \n                         your government.\n\n               His eye catching Jack, he stops in mid-sentence. A devilish \n               smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him. He pulls a \n               cigarette out and crosses right over to Jack, up close and \n               as they say, very personal. The snowflakes whirl \n               surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         Pardon monsieur...\n\n               He mimes flicking a match. He takes off his glasses and looks \n               at Jack and smiles.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         We were never really properly \n                         introduced Mister Shaw. My name is \n                         Carlos.\n\n               With a cunning, mocking smile he extends his hand out to \n               shake Jack's. Jack stares at him, ever so slowly beginning \n               to raise his hand. With that move he knows the gun will come \n               slapping into his palm and he will be able to take Carlos \n               out no matter what the cost.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (smiling)\n                         Eat shit and die slow.\n\n               His hand starts rising. In another second the gun will spring \n               into it. Just then we hear:\n\n                                     MICKENA (O.S.)\n                         Jack, no!\n\n               Jack turns to look at Mickens. Mickens indicates the \n               photographers.\n\n                                     MICKENA\n                         You don't want your picture taken \n                         shaking his hand.\n\n               Jack is momentarily confused. He has turned to Mickens \n               thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the \n               moment for the shot has passed. He turns back to Carlos who \n               shrugs and steps over to the Austrian minister so that the \n               Minister now is between Jack and Carlos and the shot is lost.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (to the minister)\n                         As I was saying, I'm sorry about the \n                         loss of life. And thank you for your \n                         cooperation.\n\n               Once again he sticks out his hand. Only this time, as the \n               cameras roll, Austria's Minister of the Interior shakes the \n               hand of the archterrorist in what will go down in history as \n               the \"handshake of shame.\"\n\n               ON JACK\n\n               His eyes tell it all.\n\n               EXT. JERUSALEM - WESTERN WALL - DAY\n\n               We begin with an ESTABLISHING SHOT of Al Aksa Mosque and the \n               Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem. These are the two most famous \n               landmarks in Jerusalem's Old City skyline.\n\n               OVER THIS WE SUPER:\n\n                                    JERUSALEM - AUGUST\n\n               CAMERA then pans and tilts down and we are above the Western \n               Wall looking down on the bobbing black hats of Hassidic Jews, \n               the knitted skullcaps of more modern Orthodox, here and there \n               the olive shirt of Army uniform with M16 or Galil assault \n               rifle that sways in prayer as well.\n\n                                                            CROSS DISSOLVE:\n\n               To the Jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the square \n               in front of the wall as we glide across the intersecting \n               lines of paving stones set one next to the other until a \n               glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which \n               crushes it out. There should be something in this sequence \n               that is reminiscent of our opening, a foreboding that just \n               as the cracks in the Parisian paving stones led us to Carlos \n               once before, perhaps these new stones will lead us once again \n               to some act of terror.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               to reveal a man standing in silhouette, the man who has just \n               crushed out the cigarette. We cannot see his face because he \n               has a camera to his eye.\n\n               NEW ANGLE - POV THROUGH THE CAMERA LENS\n\n               Through the lens of the camera just established we SEE an \n               old Rabbi praying at the wall. CLICK! The shutter captures \n               the shot.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               The man in silhouette now lowers the camera and we SEE that \n               he is CARLOS! There is no mistake even though the nose, \n               perhaps is a little different and this time he is clean-\n               shaven, it is still Carlos the Jackals. He smiles slightly.\n\n               EXT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE\n\n               Busy photographing it, Carlos doesn't seem to notice the TWO \n               ARABS who watch him surreptitiously. He walks in front of \n               soldiers who laugh and look at us POV Carlos.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Carlos reaches into his pocket. Is he perhaps going for a \n               grenade to toss at these soldiers? We build tension as he \n               pulls out instead, another roll of film and with great \n               determination, we have the CLICK of the door of the camera \n               to enhance our music beat as tension builds. Surely it can't \n               be long till Carlos does something awful.\n\n               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY\n\n               Carlos walks towards the Suq, working his way through the \n               crown from the Damascus gate as we reveal more soldiers in \n               the foreground, surveilling the area.\n\n               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY\n\n               From the POV of the two Arabs following him, we SEE Carlos \n               lost, or pretending to be, as he ambles along through the \n               Suq, past all sorts of vendors hawking their wares. Heads of \n               fish are cut off with the swift slash of a knife in one stall, \n               freshly skinned lambs hang by their feet in another. Carlos, \n               still looking lost, approaches a street vendor hawking rosary \n               beads. We SEE them talk but cannot hear their dialogue.\n\n               Carlos walks on.\n\n               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY\n\n               A group of children play an impromptu game of soccer.\n\n               NEW ANGLE - SAME SCENE - POV CARLOS THROUGH CAMERA LENS\n\n               We watch these innocent children playing. If this was a gun \n               sight they'd be dead. CLICK!\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               It is Carlos who has taken the picture. His smile at the \n               sight of the children is no longer a subtle one. There is \n               some secret enjoyment here.\n\n               It's then, that he notices the Two Arabs tailing him.\n\n               CLOSE ON - CARLOS\n\n               He frowns.\n\n               Now what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways. Carlos \n               takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or \n               two, and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley. \n               He is either trying to shake the two Arabs or he has just \n               entered every tourist's nightmare: a deserted alley in a \n               foreign country with two bad guys. He quickens his pace. The \n               Arabs do too. Carlos now knows they're after him and he takes \n               off running.\n\n               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY - CHASE SEQUENCE ANGLE\n\n               So do the two Arabs. Only now there are THREE MORE ARABS \n               coming after him.\n\n               MOVING\n\n               A tense, desperate CHASE in the Moslem Quarter's labyrinth \n               of twisted alleys and narrow streets. When his Arab pursuers \n               lose sight of him briefly, Carlos takes something out of his \n               pocket, some sort of ID and throws it in an alleyway.\n\n               EXT. SUQ - JERUSALEM - DAY\n\n               Carlos races through the Suq, past a group of Arabs who begin \n               heeding the call to prayer. They roll out prayer mats and \n               begin acclaiming in Arabic that there is only one God and \n               Mohammed is his prophet. Carlos grabs one of the canvas \n               awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe. He rips it \n               off, trying to make an obstacle course between him and his \n               pursuers. He overturns trays of olives, sacks of sunflower \n               seeds, anything he can get his hands on.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               Carlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is \n               hanging on display. He is disoriented, terrified, and then \n               seemingly from out of nowhere, he is tackled, grabbed by the \n               Arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores. Carlos \n               is overcome and brought down to the ground. One of the Arabs \n               evidently has a deep dislike for Carlos and though Carlos is \n               subdued, he kicks the shit out of him.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               INT. WINDOWLESS CELL - DAY\n\n               This room is your worst nightmare in the Middle East. It \n               could be a cellar suite in Beirut, or an interrogation cell \n               in Damascus. There is no way of knowing. It is simply an \n               empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor, \n               to which Carlos is shackled. Battered and badly bruised, \n               he's obviously in great pain. The room's metal door SCREECHES \n               as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call AMOS \n               enters. With him are two of the Arabs we've seen earlier. \n               They're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                              (accented English)\n                         How do you feel?\n\n               He smiles.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (broken English)\n                         I do not speak English.\n                              (in Spanish)\n                         Yo soy Cubano... de Cuba...

Amos brings his face down to Carlos.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Listen to me you piece of shit.

In \n               front of Jack, spread out on the desk is a file on Ramirez. \n               We SEE it as Jack does. Notes on the interrogation, Polaroid \n               photos of Ramirez in custory and the developed pictures from \n               the roll of film which Ramirez was taking in Jerusalem. Jack \n               listens to Scott and Monroe, but as he does he is taking in \n               all the information in Ramirez's file, making no judgments, \n               just taking in information.\n\n                                     SCOTT\n                         I love it!

Carlos is the \n                         single most vicious terrorist in the \n                         world. He's personally carried out \n                         or masterminded the worst terrorist \n                         attacks in modern history. Men, women, \n                         children.

Well Carlos is \n                         one of her enemies now. And he'll \n                         probably become a bigger one... \n                         terrorism... unfortunately is a growth \n                         industry.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Why are you telling me all this?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Lieutenant Commander, the governments \n                         of most countries in the free world \n                         have been after Carlos for ten years \n                         and we have nothing to show for it. \n                         There is exactly one person in the \n                         world who can help us get Carlos. \n                         And that person is you.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What do you mean... to get him?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         All I can tell you is it may take as \n                         much as six months to a year of \n                         preparation. It will involve a high \n                         degree of risk. That much said, you \n                         may never as much as lay eyes on him \n                         yourself.

Signs on the prison \n               proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden. \n               As Jack pulls up at the prison, a plainclothed operative \n               comes out and as Ramirez and Jack pull Ramirez's bag out of \n               the car, the operative slips into the driver's side and whisks \n               it away. The ground around the area is full of snow that has \n               not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete.\n\n               INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - MONTREAL - DAY\n\n               There is an observation tower in the middle of the room which \n               has become home to the pigeons who now flap noisily out of \n               it as Jack crosses with Ramirez. The place has the look of \n               an impromptu military encampment in a bombed out wreck of a \n               building. In the observation room are several nondescript \n               types. Jack shows Ramirez in.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         This is an ad hoc operation set up \n                         specifically for your mission. When \n                         that's over, not even a trace of it \n                         will remain. You don't need to know \n                         anyone's name. And from now on, your \n                         name is Miguel...

CORRIDOR - OFF OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY\n\n               Jack walks Ramirez down the corridor. They pass the \n               Surveillance Room, the small cell with its satellite dish \n               and single computer terminal and operator established earlier \n               as Technician #1. From here, cables snake their way along \n               everywhere. The place has the look of a mobile high-tech spy \n               station that just happens to be set up in a former prison. \n               Ramirez looks around. The idea of being in a prison is \n               obviously uncomfortable for him.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Your mother is Irish...

COMMAND ROOM - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY\n\n               Jack and Ramirez walk along until they come to a site which \n               could as easily be in a space station on the dark side of \n               the moon. There in the middle of a huge room looms a plastic \n               enshrouded satellite tracking system. The plastic hangs down \n               from the roof encapsulating this area to protect all of the \n               state of the art computer equipment from the dust. Inside \n               this plastic shrouded space we SEE technicians at monitors \n               which display every approach to the prison as well as monitors \n               which display the surveillance images transmitted back via \n               satellite.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         This is our surveillance and satellite \n                         tracking center.

PLASTIC COVERED COMMAND CENTER - ABANDONED PRISON -DAY\n\n               Jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command center-\n               like room. He and Ramirez enter. This place is high-tech, \n               computers and neon lighting.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Carlos has two main safe houses. One \n                         in Libya, one in East Germany. We \n                         have satellites that pass over each \n                         one three times a day. Unfortunately, \n                         the Russians know exactly when our \n                         satellites are in position so we \n                         have to assume that Carlos knows as \n                         well.\n\n               They cross over to the satellite tracking monitors which \n               display both the Libyan and East German safe houses. Sitting \n               in front of one of the monitors is Amos, typing controls \n               into the satellite tracking system.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         There's one person I want you to \n                         meet, though I think the two of you \n                         have already been introduced.\n\n               Amos now turns and comes around to Ramirez.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Hello Miguel...

Carlos himself. The \n                         French DST came to arrest him once. \n                         He was at his apartment, drunk, \n                         playing his guitar. He actually had \n                         them convinced it was all a mistake. \n                         Then he went into his bathroom, took \n                         a shave mind you so he would look \n                         his best for the interrogation and \n                         when he came out managed to shoot \n                         each of them through the forehead. \n                         Then he got the informer who had \n                         betrayed him, put him down on his \n                         knees and killed him... Think of it. \n                         He took a shave and didn't even nick \n                         himself once.\n\n               Amos is quiet, lets that sink in.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Finally, there are political \n                         realities.

The room is freezing but instead of \n               a warm jacket, he wears light prison overalls.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Good morning.

OBSERVATION ROOM - ABANDONED PRISON - DAY\n\n               Ramirez is doing furious situps, hanging off the balcony of \n               one of the tiers, with his feet linked under one of the bars \n               so that as he does his sit-up it is over an abyss. Amos stands \n               in front of Ramirez, puffing on a cigar as he speaks, so \n               that Ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he \n               exercises.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Name and place of birth!\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Illich Ramirez.

CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY\n\n               As Jack and Ramirez walk toward the cemetery, we SEE Ramirez \n               who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in \n               the cold in contrast to Jack's heavy winter gear. Ramirez \n               carries what appears to be a gun.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You need to not only remember the \n                         names on every tombstone, but where \n                         they are so when I call out a name, \n                         you whirl and shoot.\n\n               They walk into a scene that is completely surreal. Standing \n               behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers.\n\n               Each man wears a white parka and white pants against the \n               freezing cold. In the center of their impromptu circle stands \n               Ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so \n               that he shivers in the cold. All of them including Ramirez \n               hold paint pellet guns. It is a cemetery full of living \n               targets which can shoot back. Jack stands outside the circle.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         It's kind of cold.

We don't want you to be \n                         comfortable. That's just what will \n                         get you killed.\n\n               Ramirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the \n               tombstone with the name \"Brisson\" is. The trainer who stands \n               behind the \"Brisson\" tombstone has no such hesitation. He \n               fires at Ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes \n               on Ramirez's white suit. Ramirez shakes his head in \n               frustration.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         DuPres! Paquet!\n\n               Ramirez whirls, misses one, is hit again with another black \n               splotch but hits the Paquet tombstone square in the chest \n               with a black splotch of his own.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN SET - PRISON - DAY\n\n               In the middle of a huge room, a movie set has been erected. \n               There are flats supported by sand bags which form the \"set\" \n               of a kitchen. The set is perfect in every way but its position \n               inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, \n               since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever \n               see these performances. Jack is there with Ramirez. He opens \n               the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times him \n               on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. Ramirez sneezes. \n               He has caught a cold but must ignore it.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Top shelf... some milk, some juice, \n                         maybe some cottage cheese, a couple \n                         bottles of beer, some tomatoes...

CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - DAY\n\n               Ramirez sits practicing his Venezuelan accent in English, \n               repeating phrases he hears from a native speaker on a tape \n               recorder as he eats another of the interminable bowls of \n               porridge.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - MONTREAL - DAY\n\n               Ramirez once again stands in the center in his lightweight \n               white parka surrounded by trainers in heavy white parkas. \n               Jack is nearby.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Here's the thing about Carlos. He \n                         doesn't fit any mold. His father is \n                         an extraordinarily wealthy playboy \n                         who's a Marxist at the same time... \n                         DuFraisne!\n\n               Ramirez whirls and misses and is hit by the trainer. Jack \n               shakes his head and continues.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         The guy's such a fanatic he names \n                         his three sons after Lenin. And I \n                         don't mean John. The same thing is \n                         true for Carlos. He's a guerilla \n                         fighter who loves champagne and \n                         caviar... LaPierre!\n\n               Ramirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at the \n               same time that he himself is hit. Jack's look betrays no \n               emotion.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         He doesn't want to be Che Guevara, \n                         he wants to be the James Bond of the \n                         People's Liberation Front. It's not \n                         so much radical chic as an excuse \n                         for sadism. Paquet!\n\n               As he says this last, Ramirez whirls and shoots another \n               trainer, dead in the chest. Ramirez smiles. He is beginning \n               to enjoy playing terrorist.\n\n               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY\n\n               We are speeding down the road in a suped-up open Jeep POV \n               Ramirez, who is driving. Suddenly, we SEE Jack and Amos up \n               ahead. Amos pulls a lever and a barrier snaps up at chest \n               level across the road. We jam on the brakes and\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. JEEP - DAY\n\n               Ramirez is at the wheel.

Just before reaching it, the \n               car completes a 180-degree turn and roars back, but at the \n               last second fishtails and swerves off the road.\n\n               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ\n\n               He is obviously frustrated.\n\n               ANGLE ON - JACK\n\n               He shakes his head in disgust.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Dead again.\n\n               EXT. BELVEDERE - DAY\n\n               Ramirez and Jack walk together on the belvedere which is an \n               observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the \n               abandoned prison. In between the belvedere and the prison is \n               a field which is almost completely barren except for one \n               tree. It sits down below.\n\n               In the distance, we SEE a snow mobile approach with its lights \n               on. Just then, Jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter \n               and slips it into the front pocket of Ramirez's jacket, \n               turning it on as he does.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         It's a transmitter.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         For what?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Target practice. You're the target.\n\n               Jack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he \n               notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and \n               continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow \n               mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for \n               him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue \n               bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. \n               We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, \n               evidently homing in on his transmitter.\n\n               Jack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta \n               and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit-\n               up remote device.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         If you shoot out the receivers, \n                         they'll stop. There are ten rounds \n                         in this clip. The first two are live, \n                         the next three dummy, then three \n                         live, two dummy.\n\n               Ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant \n               and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the \n               gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He \n               is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. \n               The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through \n               the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and \n               running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then \n               hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow \n               mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, \n               then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. \n               That snow mobile stops in its tracks.

Ramirez bends down \n               to tie his shoe near the sofa. He crosses into the kitchen \n               and camera follows. He opens the refrigerator and takes out \n               a carton of milk. He takes a drink from the carton and \n               dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor. He gets an \n               \"I'm such a slob\" look on his face. Then he replaces the \n               milk, crosses to the sink, takes the sponge off the sink and \n               a paper towel. He mops up the spill with the sponge first \n               and then with the paper towel, then tosses the paper towel \n               into the trash. As he speaks, Ramirez himself will be amazed \n               at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques he's \n               been taught.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (looking at watch)\n                         Time's up.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Nu?

There's water in \n                         the tray underneath it. Probably \n                         from a couple of plates.

It is crowded here now \n               with Jack, Amos, and Technician #1 who sit in front of a new \n               bank of monitors. On one we SEE Ramirez eating in the \n               cafeteria.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         It should be hitting him now...\n\n               ANGLE ON MONITOR\n\n               We PUSH IN on Ramirez on the monitor.\n\n               INT. CAFETERIA - ABANDONED PRISON - EVENING\n\n               Ramirez sits as before. He is eating his caviar as he looks \n               at his Arabic textbook.\n\n               ANGLE ON - THE TEXTBOOK\n\n               It shows a picture of a street in an Arab country, possibly \n               Libya. It is a typical street scene; a dispassionately sterile \n               photograph in which one can almost hear the BBC announcer \n               voice in your head saying, \"And here is a typical scene in \n               lovely Tripoli...\" There is a man in a business suit walking \n               on the sidewalk in this picture. We CUT back and forth between \n               Ramirez and then as Ramirez strains to look harder, \n               unbelievingly, we PUSH IN tighter on the picture from his \n               POV and to our amazement, the man in the picture looking \n               back up at us is Ramirez! Then suddenly the man in the picture \n               moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us \n               and says, \"SHHHHH.\" Just then, a street vendor in the same \n               scene pulls out a gun and shoots Ramirez in the picture in \n               the head. Ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still \n               shot of Ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo, \n               oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of beautiful \n               downtown Tripoli.\n\n               He looks out the window at the bluish sky as we shift focus \n               between him and his background. He looks down at the bowl of \n               porridge.\n\n               ANGLE ON - THE CAVIAR\n\n               It is crawling with ants.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               Ramirez picks up the bowl and throws it across the room.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Jack!

CORRIDOR - ABANDONED PRISON - MONTREAL - EVENING\n\n               Ramirez walks down the corridor past the surveillance room. \n               The satellite dish is still there but there are no technicians \n               to be seen. He follows the cable that snakes down the corridor \n               towards the command room.\n\n               INT. COMMAND ROOM - MORNING\n\n               Ramirez walks along the cable until he comes to the plastic-\n               enshrouded satellite tracking system. He pulls one of the \n               plastic panels to discover that the place is totally empty. \n               He bends down and picks up the cable as if it were a lifeline \n               on a strip at stormy sea. He follows it hand over hand to \n               where all the equipment was -- it's gone. He looks around \n               and through the plastic, starts to see the silhouettes of \n               people moving and talking. Abruptly, he pulls the panel aside -- \n               just some pigeons against the moonlight shafts.\n\n               INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - EVENING\n\n               Ramirez enters the Observation Room with its looming \n               observation tower that now has become home to the hundreds \n               of pigeons inside it. The place is completely deserted.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Jack!!\n\n               At the sound of his shout, hundreds of pigeons explode out \n               of the observation tower like bats in a primal cave. Ramirez \n               instinctively crouches in terror.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Amos you piece of shit!

The cells are full of Cuban political \n               prisoners. There are shouts and screams of agony from men \n               being tortured somewhere far off. They reach Ramirez's \n               father's cell. Child Ramirez reaches out for his father's \n               hand. A guard pushes his hand away.

It is coming straight out of the dove's mouth and \n               straight at us, to devour us. We HEAR RAMIREZ SCREAM OVER \n               THIS.\n\n               INT.

You \n                         have to be ready for anything, all \n                         the time.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Fuck you!\n\n               Just then we HEAR the roar of the snowmobiles coming out of \n               nowhere, bearing down towards them.\n\n                                     JACK\n                              (calmly)\n                         The clip in your gun has three live, \n                         two dummy, one live, three dummy, \n                         one live.\n\n               Ramirez looks at him, pushed to the breaking point now. He \n               pulls the transmitter out of his pocket and crosses right to \n               Jack and stuffs it in Jack's pocket.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         No rules, Jack? Then you fucking \n                         deal with it.\n\n               Ramirez waits for Jack to say something... to protest... to \n               say anything. Jack says nothing. Ramirez turns in a fury and \n               starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four \n               different directions, coming straight towards Jack. Jack \n               says absolutely nothing. Ramirez turns and sees Jack is making \n               absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter. Jack simply \n               locks eyes with Ramirez. Jack is not going to budge. Ramirez \n               turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the \n               noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting Jack \n               grows louder. Ramirez can take it no more. He turns, pulls \n               out the gun and must run right to where Jack is in order to \n               get shots off at each snowmobile. He fires through the dummy \n               rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles, the last of \n               which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both. \n               Ramirez is exhausted. When Jack speaks it is quietly and \n               with contempt.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You pussy. You rule-following pussy.\n\n               Ramirez turns, looking at Jack, unable to believe his ears.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         You know why you don't fuck around \n                         on your wife? Not because you don't \n                         want to. You're a man. You want to \n                         fuck everything. But you don't... \n                         because you're afraid it would cost \n                         you what... your wife, your family, \n                         your self respect maybe...\n\n               As we watch Ramirez listening to Jack, we can see him going \n               over the edge.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         ...You know what Carlos would do if \n                         he was married? He'd bring whatever \n                         woman he wanted home and make his \n                         wife fuck her. That's what no rules \n                         means. That's what you're too much \n                         of a pussy to get.\n\n               Ramirez walks straight over to Jack, pulls his hair back so \n               that Jack is staring up at him and then he puts the barrel \n               of his gun at Jack's temple. Ramirez is not bluffing now. He \n               has gone completely into the dark side for the first time.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         No rules, Jack?

The U.S. Navy's my alibi. \n                         What's the count on my ammunition, \n                         Jack? Is this one live or a dud?\n\n               He stares down at Jack and we can see that Jack does not \n               remember the count, as Ramirez pulls the trigger. CLICK!\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What about the next one, Jack?

It's over!\n\n               Ramirez turns to see him, as Amos walks down the embankment \n               towards him.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Stay out of it.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         It's over, Jack. He's it.\n\n               Ramirez stays with the gun pointed at Jack. It is obvious he \n               is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze \n               the trigger once again. Amos takes the gun from Ramirez, \n               points it up and pulls the trigger... KABOOM!\n\n               EXT.

PEUGEOT - DEAD SEA - ISRAEL\n\n               Jack is in the car with Amos, who drives, and Ramirez. Ramirez \n               has a bandage across his nose.

It's \n                         the opposite of what he was forced \n                         to wear as a child... you know... \n                         the school uniforms, the white tight \n                         collared shirts...

SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET\n\n               At first we should not realize we are near a building of any \n               kind. We open on a WIDE ANGLE on the Dead Sea from a stunning \n               POV. CRANE DOWN to reveal the silhouette of Ramirez smoking \n               a cigarette. We now SEE that his nose is exactly that of \n               Carlos. He has just a bit of dark circles left under his \n               eyes, just enough to make him seem moody. He tosses the \n               cigarette and turns to enter a room. Now we see that this is \n               a deserted barracks pock-marked with artillery shells and \n               machine gun bullet holes from past wars.\n\n               EXT. BALCONY - SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez turns to enter the barracks with a wide-angle of the \n               landscape overlooking the Dead Sea. He now wears a black T-\n               shirt and black jeans. The Peugeot is parked near the barracks \n               that sits on the edge of the cliff in b.g.\n\n               INT. SAFE HOUSE - DEAD SEA - SUNSET\n\n               start TIGHT on a shot of an ashtray. It is overflowing with \n               cigarettes. A woman's hand picks up the butt that is in the \n               ashtray and with the last of its ember she lights another \n               cigarette off it. She is CARLA, mid-thirties, hard edged \n               which mars the beauty she still has. She is intense, neurotic \n               and bitter.\n\n               She and Ramirez are alone in the living room. She sits in a \n               corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in \n               contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in \n               ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, \n               with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that \n               resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an \n               altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even \n               acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind of \n               reverie.\n\n                                     CARLA\n                         The thing about Carlos is... he \n                         doesn't lose himself with a woman... \n                         not with a lover... maybe with a \n                         whore I don't know... I wasn't his \n                         whore. Lovers are different to him... \n                         he might have a use for them... so \n                         he has to seduce them properly. He \n                         has to make sure they're so crazy \n                         about him they'll do anything for \n                         him.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         When did you...?\n\n               She holds up a hand without looking at him, commanding his \n               silence.\n\n                                     CARLA\n                         Shhh! You're not here.\n\n               She rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now \n               for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she \n               holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of \n               the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't \n               bother to wipe it away.

You've cheated \n                         on your wife... now you can do \n                         anything.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What I did in there I didn't do to \n                         cheat on my wife and you know it.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Hey, pussy's pussy.\n\n               Ramirez turns to look at him as if a light bulb has just \n               gone on.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         I just got it about you, Jack. You \n                         can't get it up, can you?\n\n               The look on Jack's face for once, having been caught \n               completely off guard, betrays the fact that Ramirez is dead-\n               on. Just then, we HEAR:\n\n                                     AMOS (O.S.)\n                         We've got it.

And Agnieska has received \n                         her summons from her long-lost love... \n                         Carlos, telling her to come and meet \n                         you. At the meeting you convince her \n                         you're Carlos. You ask her to handle \n                         some bank transactions. She will. \n                         Then the KGB knows Carlos and Ortega \n                         are the same man. Then later they'll \n                         see you meet with a CIA agent. They'll \n                         have all the pieces. They'll know \n                         Carlos has turned.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Where do I meet with this Agnieska?\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Libya.

We've laid out \n                         a trap. Now we have to be careful \n                         not to get caught in it ourselves.\n\n               EXT. SHORE OF DEAD SEA - ISRAEL - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez and Amos walk along the road which runs straight \n               along the Dead Sea. Here and there are strands of barbed \n               wire and the barracks in the b.g. As they walk, they pass a \n               sign which says: THE DEAD SEA - YOU ARE NOW STANDING AT THE \n               LOWEST SPOT ON EARTH... ELEVATION: 393 METERS BELOW SEA LEVEL.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Jack doesn't know that we're having \n                         this talk and I don't want him to \n                         know... understand?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Okay...\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Nothing can make you ready for combat \n                         but combat. Jack would be against me \n                         telling you this... He would say you \n                         shouldn't have a thought in your \n                         head that we haven't put there but \n                         you're not just a box that we're \n                         going to fill up with our own ideas. \n                         You have a right to know certain \n                         things.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         I appreciate that Amos... a lot. \n                         It's funny, I started out hating \n                         you...

Listen to me... \n                         You're going to feel more alone than \n                         you've ever felt in your life. It \n                         will hit you all of a sudden and \n                         you'll think your heart's going to \n                         jump out of your chest, you'll think \n                         everyone around you can hear your \n                         heart beating, and that everyone \n                         around you is an enemy agent. I want \n                         you to be prepared for that. So you \n                         can deal with it. Understand?\n\n               In the far distance, we are vaguely aware of a huge truck \n               barreling along, coming straight down the highway towards \n               them.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         We had an agent... the best we ever \n                         had in training. We were going to \n                         infiltrate him into Beirut and then \n                         use him to penetrate the PFLP. No \n                         student ever scored higher than this \n                         man... We set up his cover for six \n                         months in Argentina. He was perfect. \n                         And then we sent him to Beirut. He \n                         got off the plane, went to his hotel, \n                         went up to his room and had a nervous \n                         breakdown.\n\n               Suddenly it seems, the truck is right on top of them, heading \n               straight for them, like monster in a child's nightmare. It \n               passes within inches and Ramirez has to fight to keep from \n               jumping as the truck roars past them. It is not a monster, \n               just a truck. Then again, it could have killed them just the \n               same.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         We had to mount an operation to send \n                         in a man posing as a doctor so we \n                         could drug him and get him out on a \n                         plane. Okay? Now you understand? \n                         Nothing prepares you. I want you to \n                         know that so when it hits you, you \n                         don't panic, you feel the fear and \n                         then get rid of it.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Jesus...\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         You splash some water on your face. \n                         You take some deep breaths. You look \n                         in the mirror and when you look in \n                         that mirror, I don't want you to \n                         find Annibal Ramirez. You find Carlos. \n                         If you find Carlos, that's what \n                         everyone else will find too. And if \n                         you find Carlos and anything goes \n                         wrong, he's the one who can get you \n                         out of it. Because he's the best.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                              (after a beat)\n                         I got a wife I got to go back to \n                         when this is over. I got kids I got \n                         to go back to when this is over. I \n                         want to go back as Annibal Ramirez... \n                         not Carlos.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         You will... you'll need a time of \n                         decompression and it will be hard at \n                         first, but you will. Because inside \n                         you aren't Carlos... you aren't a \n                         terrorist. But right now, in order \n                         to save your life, you've got to be. \n                         You've got to look in the mirror and \n                         find Carlos.

In the \n               line of arriving PASSENGERS, at the passport control booth, \n               is a limping Colombian businessman. Scanning the place from \n               behind sunglasses, his heart is POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING. \n               This is it.

Ramirez heads over to the Customs booth. \n               He turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich \n               Arabic family. A young fat girl holding some toys grimaces \n               at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family \n               through the crowd. In the b.g. we notice a Mercedes waiting \n               for them through the glass doors of the airport. Ramirez \n               continues on his way towards the Customs booth.

His heart's \n               POUNDING, however, intensifies.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         For the oil...\n\n                                     OFFICIAL\n                         Oil?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Pipes for oil...

LIBYA PALACE HOTEL - DAY\n\n               We have a shot of the cab, an old Mercedes coming towards \n               us, and then under the arch leading to the entrance of the \n               hotel. Ramirez steps out and he's assailed by a bunch of \n               kids begging and trying to grab his baggage. He looks around.\n\n               ANGLE - POV RAMIREZ\n\n               Across the street at a cafe soldiers with guns laugh. From a \n               shop window, the silhouette of a man seems to look right at \n               us. Across the street, kids on a balcony throw a water balloon \n               at a horse pulling a cart and the horse bolts right in front \n               of Ramirez.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               As the street urchins continue to beg and grab at his luggage, \n               and the taxi driver demands impatiently to be paid, suddenly \n               out of nowhere, a bellboy appears and smacks one of the kids \n               who falls to the ground. They all disperse as the bellboy \n               takes the luggage and leads Ramirez who pays the cab driver \n               and then crosses to the hotel.\n\n               INT. HOTEL ROOM - LIBYA - DAY\n\n               The bellboy enters with Ramirez, sets down his bags and then \n               opens the shutters of the window. Ramirez tips him silently. \n               Once the bellboy has left, Ramirez walks to the phone and \n               checks it out. Then he crosses to the shutters. Perhaps he \n               sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment \n               across the street. He closes the shutters. Just then, there's \n               a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He jumps and automatically goes \n               for his gun. But he has no gun... and his heart begins to \n               POUND again. The LOUD KNOCK repeats itself.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                              (in Spanish)\n                         Who's there?\n\n               An incomprehensible response in Arabic.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                              (in accented English)\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Room service.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                              (after a pause)\n                         I not order nothing.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Iced water.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Iced water?\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Yes, sir.\n\n               The voice is young, and not too assertive. Ramirez consults \n               his watch and looks out the window again. Everything still \n               seems to be normal.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Sir...?\n\n               Ramirez carefully opens the door. In walks a young, rather \n               innocent-looking WAITER with a jar of ice water. He wears a \n               fez on his head. As he places it on a table, Ramirez eyes \n               him with suspicion. Suddenly the waiter reaches underneath \n               his jacket and... pulls out a small handgun.\n\n               ON RAMIREZ\n\n               He is frozen with fear.\n\n               ON WAITER\n\n               Putting his finger to his mouth to signal silence, he shoves \n               the gun and silencer under a napkin. Then he takes off his \n               fez and from within, pulls out a small grenade and extra \n               clip of ammunition. Without any further attempt at \n               communication, he exits the room.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Jesus.\n\n               Ramirez walks back into the bathroom. He splashes water on \n               his face and takes three deep breaths and then slowly looks \n               up into the mirror... and finds Carlos.\n\n               EXT. STREET IN LIBYA - DOWNTOWN TRIPOLI - DAY\n\n               We SEE a beautiful dark haired woman of about thirty coming \n               down the street. There are several other pedestrians as well. \n               The woman is Agnieska. She carries a large bag of groceries.\n\n               EXT. STREET - TRIPOLI, LIBYA - RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY\n\n               A van is parked on the street. Agnieska walks along. The van \n               starts. A man whom we will come to know as VLADIMIR adjusts \n               the mirror. His partner NIKOLAI readjusts it and in it we \n               SEE Agnieska, walking. The two KGB operatives, now both see \n               Agnieska.\n\n                                     VLADIMIR\n                         [There she comes...]\n\n                                     NIKOLAI\n                         [Do you see Misha?]\n\n                                     VLADIMIR\n                         [Not yet.]\n\n               Behind Agnieska about fifty feet behind her we SEE several \n               pedestrians, one is an Arab and another a European. Agnieska \n               goes up into an apartment building.\n\n                                     VLADIMIR\n                         [There he is.]\n\n               Around the corner comes another Arab businessman type. The \n               first Arab stops in front of the apartment house and bends \n               down to tie his shoe. The second Arab comes up alongside of \n               him and the first Arab gives an almost imperceptible nod. \n               The second Arab goes into the apartment house.\n\n                                     VLADIMIR\n                         [He's passing her to Leonid. For \n                         Russians, they make good Arabs.]\n\n               The van makes a U-turn and pulls around the corner to give \n               them another vantage point of Agnieska's apartment.\n\n               INT. VAN - LIBYA - DAY\n\n               The two Russian operatives continue their stakeout of \n               Agnieska's apartment.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT - LIBYA - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Agnieska enters the apartment. She opens the door and slowly \n               walks in. The apartment is dark. She is about to turn on the \n               lights when suddenly a hand grabs her from behind around her \n               mouth and another hand holding a gun snaps right down next \n               to her head. She drops the groceries and screams but the \n               hand muffles it. She struggles a bit but the person who holds \n               her hisses.\n\n                                     PERSON HOLDING HER\n                              (in an Arabic accent)\n                         SHHHHHHH. One sound and you're dead.\n\n               Outside the door we hear faintly the sound of footsteps. We \n               still cannot make out who is holding her. He appears to be \n               an Arab in traditional garb completely bald with mustache \n               and glasses. He speaks in a thick Arabic accent.\n\n                                     PERSON HOLDING HER\n                         Carlos... when is he coming here?\n\n               He loosens the grasp on her mouth.\n\n                                     AGNIESKA\n                         I don't know what you're talking \n                         about.\n\n                                     PERSON HOLDING HER\n                         Don't play games with me.

He \n               cocks the trigger back with a loud noise. The gun has a \n               silencer on it.\n\n                                     PERSON HOLDING HER\n                         This gun has a silencer.

She'll be here \n                         tomorrow... please.\n\n               The person who is holding her throws her to the floor.

I'm telling the \n                         truth...\n\n               The bald Arab who was holding her slowly takes his belt out \n               of its loops and puts his gun back in his pants. He holds \n               the belt as if he is going to strangle her.\n\n                                     AGNIESKA\n                         What... what are you going to do to \n                         me.\n\n                                     PERSON WHO WAS HOLDING HER\n                         First...

He pulls a cucumber out of the \n               refrigerator and takes a bite and makes a face.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Ughhh... I don't blame you.\n\n               He opens the lid on the garbage can and throws the cucumber \n               inside.\n\n               ANGLE ON INSIDE OF GARBAGE CAN\n\n               At the bottom are cigarette butts. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON ONE - \n               IT IS FILTER-TIPPED.\n\n               Ramirez turns around to her and comes up behind her.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Who was here smoking a filter-tip \n                         cigarette my darling?\n\n                                     AGNIESKA\n                         What?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         You don't smoke filters.\n\n                                     AGNIESKA\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n               He grabs her by the back of the neck and shoves her face \n               down into the garbage can.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         That's what I'm talking about!

Then all of a sudden \n               he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         The nearest cafe is two blocks away. \n                         A cigarette wouldn't have lasted \n                         that long... so you bummed a cigarette \n                         but it wasn't in a cafe... it was \n                         very close to here... In this \n                         apartment building. Who did you meet \n                         with? That window was a signal wasn't \n                         it?! Wasn't it you puta bitch!\n\n               He starts to strangle her and we see not Ramirez but Carlos.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Tell me or you're dead!\n\n               He is choking the life out of her. She croaks out an answer.\n\n                                     AGNIESKA\n                         The French... the DST... They made \n                         me...

Ramirez throws Agnieska down, grabs \n               his gun and grenade and races to the open window and goes \n               out onto the fire escape. His feet are bare. He has no shirt \n               on.\n\n               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - APARTMENT BUILDING - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez comes out of the apartment onto the fire escape. \n               Bullets hit the wall next to him and below we SEE several \n               DST agents shooting up at him. A DST agent appears inside \n               the apartment and shoots at Ramirez. Ramirez moves out of \n               the way of the shattered window.\n\n               ANGLE - POV RAMIREZ\n\n               looking down and across the alley.\n\n               INT.

What the hell is going \n                         on?!]\n\n               The two Russian operatives get out of their van.\n\n               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               DST agents from below are shooting up at Ramirez. Their \n               gunfire destroys everything in sight. Ramirez leaps over the \n               railing and flies across the street, landing on a terrace. \n               His momentum is so strong that he is propelled through the \n               glass doors of the terrace.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT - NEXT LEVEL - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez goes through the window of the apartment as bullets \n               continue to fly. He cuts his feet on the broken glass.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT - NEXT LEVEL - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez quickly goes through the apartment, falling into the \n               room, landing hard where a family is eating and watching TV. \n               We see now that Ramirez is wounded.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez comes out the door and starts toward the stairs. \n               Ramirez suddenly bangs into a DST agent. The two of them \n               look at each other in shock for a beat. Neither was expecting \n               the other to be there. The moment seems to last forever. \n               They are literally face to face. Which one will react first? \n               Ramirez takes half a step back, raises his gun and fires, \n               exploding the DST agent's forehead. Ramirez has a moment of \n               horror, splattered with the blood and brains of this man. We \n               Intercut a flash of the DST man being hit in an instant, \n               almost subliminal replay as if Ramirez's brain must register \n               the scene twice to comprehend it. Just then, a shot rings \n               out from below and Ramirez, who can't help staring in horror \n               at the dead man, flees once more for his life.\n\n               INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - STAIRWELL - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Two more DST agents follow the trail of blood up the stairs.\n\n               EXT. ROOF - APARTMENT HOUSE - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez arrives at the top of the stairs. Reaching the edge \n               of the roof, Ramirez looks across to the other side. The DST \n               agents arrive at the top and see Ramirez. Ramirez takes a \n               deep breath and jumps, barely making it, clinging onto a \n               pipe on the side of the building. Once again, we Intercut \n               the quick flashback of the DST man being shot. Then, as shots \n               ring out around him, Ramirez pulls himself up and gets away.\n\n               EXT. ROOF - APARTMENT HOUSE - LIBYA - SUNSET\n\n               Ramirez checks over the side of the building to see a DST \n               car following. One agent steps out and starts to shoot at \n               him. Ramirez fires back and shatters the windshield and then \n               jumps to the next rooftop.\n\n               EXT. ROOF - APARTMENT HOUSE - LIBYA - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               Ramirez's silhouette runs from roof to roof.\n\n               EXT. ROOF - APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               Ramirez trips over a piece of metal and crashes through the \n               metal roof of a shed, and then, landing, he takes off running \n               through the narrow alley below.\n\n               EXT. ROOF - APARTMENT - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               Ramirez runs down the dark and narrow alley.\n\n               EXT. NARROW ALLEY - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               Outside a Turkish cafe, a DST agent shoots at Ramirez. All \n               the diners duck for cover. Ramirez shoots out the lights, \n               the fixture sparks and flies off its hook, sending a string \n               of lights crashing down toward the DST agent, the bulbs \n               exploding around his head.\n\n               EXT. SMALL ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez arrives at a small street. In the distance we SEE \n               the lights of a bright and busy street. Suddenly, headlights \n               hit his face, gunfire rings out and Ramirez takes off followed \n               by the oncoming car.\n\n               INT. COURTYARD - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez is running from the car dodging bullets. Ramirez \n               lobs a grenade at the car. It explodes right in front of the \n               car, not taking it out, just damaging it. Ramirez runs across \n               the street and is hit suddenly by a motorcycle which then \n               veers off and goes crashing into an oncoming car. Ramirez \n               gets up and runs into a doorway.\n\n               INT. COURTYARD - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez, sweating and out of breath, scans his new and dark \n               surroundings. While bleeding, Ramirez suddenly turns around \n               and shoots. A DST agent falls out of the darkness, dead. \n               Ramirez hears something. Turning around, Ramirez shoots an \n               agent at the top of the building. The body falls and gets \n               tangled into the string of electrical wires. He reaches into \n               his pocket, pulls out another clip and re-loads.\n\n               EXT. STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez comes out of the doorway and waves down a taxi. \n               Ramirez jumps into the driver's seat, pushing the driver \n               aside. When the driver resists, Ramirez throws him out into \n               the street.\n\n               A passing truck nearly hits the driver. Other Arabs start \n               approaching Ramirez but back off immediately once he raises \n               his gun. The taxi makes a U-turn and leaves, racing through \n               traffic. Ramirez checks his mirror and sees that he is picked \n               up by a DST car. They begin to shoot at Ramirez and his back \n               window shatters.\n\n               EXT. SMALLER STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez is driving full speed. The car jumps as it hits the \n               junction of the street. Ramirez continues to be followed by \n               the car of DST agents. Ramirez turns into a small alley.\n\n               EXT. NARROW STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez drives down the narrow street. The sides of the car \n               barely fit through. Sparks fly from the metal scratching \n               against the walls. The taxi's mirror pops off as the chase \n               continues.\n\n               EXT. SMALLER STREET WITH ARCHES - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               The cars continue to race through the streets. Ramirez \n               suddenly sees two kids coming out of a garage. Ramirez veers \n               out of the way and misses the kids. The car goes crashing \n               into scaffolding and paint drops down onto the windshield. \n               Once again, we Intercut the flashback of Ramirez killing the \n               first DST agent, being splattered with his blood. Ramirez \n               continues to drive away, wiping away the paint on the \n               windshield.\n\n               EXT. SMALLER STREET WITH CAFE - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez tries to wipe away the paint. The cars continue to \n               race through the streets.\n\n               EXT. STREET - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               The two cars disappear down a hill. Ramirez's vision is \n               blurred by the paint on the windshield. A car suddenly appears \n               that forces him to veer left into a stairwell. The taxi \n               descends the stairway. Ramirez suddenly pulls the parking \n               brake and the other car hits Ramirez's car and flips over it \n               and explodes. Ramirez, watching the explosion, takes off the \n               other way.\n\n               EXT. STREET IN LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               On the harbor, a police car is seen next to Ramirez's taxi. \n               The sergeant reveals some blood inside the taxi but Ramirez \n               is nowhere to be found. We SEE the KGB on the scene.\n\n               EXT. HARBOR - LIBYA - NIGHT\n\n               The fishing boat enters the harbor. Jack stands on the deck \n               as the boat passes under a bridge. Out of nowhere a man jumps \n               onto Jack and shoves him to the ground. Holding him by the \n               neck, Amos appears and is about to hit Ramirez but Ramirez \n               grabs Amos' arm and stares at him.\n\n               EXT. VILLA - LIBYA - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING SHOT\n\n               We SEE Carlos' villa through the barbed wire. The silhouette \n               of a guard is on top of the building.\n\n               INT. VILLA BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               The real Carlos is asleep in the bed with a beautiful Arabic \n               woman. A Japanese KOJ enters and taps Carlos on the shoulder. \n               Instantly he springs awake with a gun in his hand pointed at \n               KOJ.\n\n                                     KOJ\n                         Illich... you must get dressed.

I asked if you knew \n                         where I could buy a newspaper.\n\n               Ramirez stops for a moment. He knows that the line is some \n               kind of code and he has no response to give so he starts up \n               walking again. Koj is instantly behind Ramirez, his hand \n               going into his flight bag and pushing the flight bag up \n               against Ramirez's back.\n\n                                     KOJ\n                         Make the slightest move and I shoot... \n                         and I don't miss. Walk to the rest \n                         room, very carefully.\n\n               Ramirez does as he is told.\n\n               ANGLE ON\n\n               Amos. He watches it all going down in the back of a chrome \n               napkin holder. He slowly gets up, looks around for Jack and \n               goes out into the corridor and sees Koj and Ramirez going \n               into the rest room. Koj sees one of those sandwich board \n               signs off to the side which says, \"LAVATORY TEMPORARILY CLOSED \n               FOR CLEANING.\" He pulls it in front of the door.\n\n               INT. RESTROOM - STALL - HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY\n\n               Koj has Ramirez's head with one hand, while he holds the gun \n               on him with the other. He forces Ramirez's head down deep \n               into the toilet bowl. He flushes. The water level sinks and \n               then rises, covering Ramirez's face. Koj holds him under \n               water long enough to almost drown him. Then, instead of \n               lifting his head out, he flushes again and the water level \n               lowers.\n\n                                     KOJ\n                         Tell me what I want to know quickly \n                         or you're dead.\n\n               Just then Ramirez manages to kick back and overpower Koj and \n               send him flying back out through the door of the stall. \n               Ramirez is back on him in a second but Koj has his gun up \n               and pointed right at Ramirez's head. They have shifted \n               position now, so that they are not facing the stall, but the \n               door of the bathroom. Koj is about to pull the trigger when \n               we HEAR:\n\n                                     AMOS (O.S.)\n                         Down!!\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               Ramirez ducks and rolls out of the way and Amos fires two \n               shots into Koj's chest but not before Koj can get off a round \n               right into Amos' chest. In an instant Ramirez is on the still-\n               alive Koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it \n               down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that cracks his \n               skull. He quickly crosses to Amos who is dying.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Get out of here... now...\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         I've got to get you to a doctor.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Get out now...\n\n               Ramirez cradles him.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         I'm not going to let you die here... \n                         I've still got a lawsuit against \n                         you, remember?\n\n               Here, Amos speaks as a doomed father would to a son who still \n               has a chance to save himself from the Holocaust.\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         My dear boy... my dear dear boy...

Ramirez is \n               the brave and dutiful son as his father says, coaching, \n               teaching him to the last...\n\n                                     AMOS\n                         Walk slowly... no attention.\n\n               Ramirez is ashen faced, knows Amos is right and forces himself \n               to stand up and walk almost robot-like out of the restroom.\n\n               INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               On a long shot we SEE Ramirez walk down the corridor till he \n               sees Jack. He says a few words to him and then starts to \n               walk back toward the restroom. Jack grabs his arm and \n               literally walks him out of the corridor and down an escalator.\n\n               INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - PHONE BOOTH - DAY\n\n               Jack and Ramirez stand next to a phone booth. Jack is on the \n               phone dialing.

RAMIREZ HOME - VIRGINIA - DAY - RAIN\n\n               A taxi pulls up in front of Ramirez's house. Ramirez steps \n               out of the taxi dressed in his Navy uniform and carrying his \n               sea bag. He does not have a hat on and we SEE his head while \n               not bald, is now in the shortest of buzz cuts, certainly \n               much shorter than the way his wife last saw him. He stands \n               outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come \n               back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small. \n               Just then the door opens. There is Maura holding the baby \n               and next to her, Joey. Ramirez runs toward them and they to \n               him and we SEE them in tableaux, embracing. An idyllic family \n               reunited.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

It rocks back and \n               forth violently as we PAN UP and SEE Ramirez, who is fucking \n               Maura. They are both fully clothed, skirt hiked up, fly \n               unzipped. This is not lovemaking. He is fucking her brains \n               out. It is passionate, rough sex. Maura hits high \"C\" as \n               Ramirez sweeps books off of a table, lifts her out of the \n               chair and lays her out on the table. The two of them climax \n               together. It is clear from Maura's look that this is the \n               best sex she's ever had. Ramirez slowly rolls off her. He is \n               smiling as well, and then becomes aware that Maura has begun \n               to cry.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What's wrong?\n\n                                     MAURA\n                         You've been with another woman... \n                         haven't you.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What are you talking about?\n\n                                     MAURA\n                         Haven't you?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         No. What... what would make you say \n                         a thing like that?\n\n                                     MAURA\n                         You're different...\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Maura...

Adorable kids are dressed up in \n               their uniforms ready to play the next level of baseball. \n               They have graduated from T-ball to coach-pitch, in which the \n               coach pitches the ball for the kids. There are hot dogs and \n               lounge chairs, family dogs and... fathers. The mothers are \n               there as well, as are brothers and sisters, but primarily it \n               is the fathers trying to fulfill their own dreams of sports \n               glory through their kids.\n\n               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ AND JOEY\n\n               Ramirez has his arm around Joey, giving him his last bit of \n               fatherly advice.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Okay... remember, what do we do?\n\n                                     JOEY\n                         Keep my eye on the ball.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         And who's the guy who wins?\n\n                                     JOEY\n                         Whoever has fun, wins.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Right! So you go out there and have \n                         fun.\n\n               He gives Joey \"five\" and Joey runs out to join his team at \n               their dugout. Ramirez starts walking about toward Maura and \n               the baby. As he does, he crosses next to another father, \n               FRANK, who is with his son TYLER. Frank is about six foot \n               four and to say that he is competitive would be the \n               understatement of the year. He is haranguing his kid as if \n               this were the deciding game of the World Series. He is on \n               one knee so we don't see just how big he is.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         I don't want so see you out there \n                         dickin' around today, you understand?\n\n               Tyler looks at his shoes. He is cowed and embarrassed.\n\n                                     TYLER\n                         Yes sir.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         You're gonna be focused and aggressive \n                         and you're gonna play to win. Got \n                         it?\n\n               Tyler is still staring at his toes.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         Hey, you think I'm talking just to \n                         hear myself talk? Look at me when \n                         I'm talking to you!\n\n               Frank suddenly smacks him in the face. Annibal stops in front \n               of the two of them.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Hey pal, lighten up, what do you \n                         say? It's just a game?\n\n               Frank looks at Ramirez and stands to his full six foot four.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         What did you say?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         I said lighten up.

So why don't we let our kids \n                         have a good time. Come on, I'll buy \n                         you a beer.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         I don't need you to buy me a fuckin' \n                         beer, you piece of shit. And you \n                         stick your face in my business again \n                         and I'll beat the living fuck out of \n                         you. What do you say to that?\n\n               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ\n\n               There isn't a trace of Ramirez here at all. It is pure Carlos.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         What are you smilin' at, asshole?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                              (very quiet)\n                         A dead man...\n\n               But before Ramirez can move, we HEAR:\n\n                                     MAURA (O.S.)\n                         Annibal... please!\n\n               Ramirez turns. Maura is there beside him.\n\n                                     MAURA\n                         Annibal please. Let's go sit down.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         Good idea, Annabelle. Your ol' lady \n                         just saved your ass.\n\n                                     MAURA\n                         Annibal... please... Please...\n\n               Maura tugs at Ramirez's arm and Frank smirks. Ramirez cages \n               the monster inside and turns with Maura. As he turns, Frank \n               turns to Tyler as if he cannot believe the boy is still there.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         What are you doin' standing here?! \n                         You're supposed to be over there \n                         with your team! Now move!\n\n               The boy hesitates. Frank rears back his arm to hit him.\n\n                                     FRANK\n                         I said...\n\n               But before Frank can complete the sentence and strike his \n               child, Ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick \n               planted straight to Frank's head. It is sudden and violent \n               and brutal. He comes down and with one side-kick, \"knee-caps\" \n               Frank, which is to say he hits the top of Frank's kneecap \n               and breaks it so that it is down around his shin. Frank starts \n               to drop but before he can, Ramirez grabs his ears and brings \n               his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. The result \n               is devastating and Frank's nose is now all across his face. \n               Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again. Now the object \n               is Frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of Ramirez's \n               knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well.\n\n               In slow motion, Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in \n               horror at what his father has just done. At the same time, \n               maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez. Ramirez however is \n               not done. Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez \n               leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing \n               his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be \n               slaughtered. This time instead of a knife, it will be a karate \n               chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank's windpipe and kill \n               him. But before he can deliver the blow, Maura grabs his \n               arm. He turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her \n               off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks \n               from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he \n               has plunged.\n\n               EXT.

The mansion's front \n               windows are heavily shuttered, with little light filtering \n               through. Nearby is a small lake.\n\n               INT. IVAN AND ANDREI'S CAR - ACROSS FROM CARLOS' HIDEOUT - \n               LATE DAY\n\n               Ivan looks through binoculars, staking out the mansion. He \n               suddenly becomes agitated.\n\n                                     IVAN\n                         [Look!]\n\n               Andrei picks up his camera.\n\n               THROUGH BINOCULARS\n\n               A man's figure emerges stealthily from the shadows of the \n               mansion's back wall.\n\n               ZOOM\n\n               The blonde, bearded Ramirez.\n\n                                     ANDREI\n                         [You think it's him?]\n\n               CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... The quick sound of the camera shutters.\n\n               Faintly we HEAR the sound of a motorbike start up. Then we \n               SEE Ramirez on the motorbike heading off. Ivan and Andrei \n               follow him at a distance.\n\n               EXT. ROAD LEADING INTO EAST BERLIN - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               The KGB car falls in behind another car separating it from \n               the motorbike and follows Ramirez into town. He passes by \n               giant steam pipes in the foreground as the KGB car follows.\n\n               EXT. ROAD - EAST BERLIN - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               A tram wipes the screen to reveal Ramirez, on his motorbike, \n               followed by the KGB car. The landscape is desolate, with \n               drab row-houses. Ramirez gets to a red light. As it turns \n               green he sees the KGB car in his mirror. He jams across the \n               street, just barely fitting in between two criss-crossing \n               streetcars. Ivan and Andre lose sight of Ramirez.\n\n               EXT. STREET - EAST BERLIN - DUSK\n\n               Ivan and Andre shoot forward and then slow, as they spot \n               Ramirez buying a newspaper at a newstand.\n\n               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ\n\n               He holds his motorcycle helmet in his hand, and using it as \n               a mirror, he sees the KGB car in its reflection. Satisfied \n               that they have caught up with him again, he walks across the \n               street to the beer hall.\n\n               INT. BEER HALL - DUSK\n\n               The large bierstube is crowded, noisy and enveloped in a \n               thick cloud of cigarette smoke. Its lively, at times rowdy \n               clientele is in various stages of intoxication. As the loud, \n               oom-pah-pah-pah band plays popular German music, those who \n               are not too busy eating, talking, or emptying liter-sized \n               beer steins, sing along.\n\n               ON RAMIREZ\n\n               Fighting the crowd, he heads for the back of the beer hall, \n               looking for his contact.\n\n               ON IVAN AND ANDREI\n\n               Entering the place, they pretend to be camera-carrying Russian \n               tourists. A common sight in East Berlin.\n\n               ON RAMIREZ\n\n               He stops and stares.\n\n               RAMIREZ'S POV\n\n               Through the jam pack, the profile of a man, with a Tyrol hat \n               who sits along the back wall. Busy eating, he seems totally \n               oblivious to the hoopla around him. We can't really see his \n               face.\n\n               ON RAMIREZ\n\n               As he cautiously approaches what he thinks is Jack. It isn't \n               him. There is a sudden look of panic on his face and then he \n               spots Jack also in the same kind of hat. Lifting his head, \n               and turning to face Ramirez, we too recognize him. Under the \n               hat, and the new heavy eyebrows and mustache, is... Jack. He \n               smiles, takes off his hat, and motions his quest to sit down.\n\n               ON ANDREI (THROUGH IVAN'S CAMERA)\n\n               He's posing with a giant stein. A slight shift of focus and \n               we can see Ramirez. Jack, however, is hidden by the waiter's \n               back. Then, the Waiter moves on.\n\n               ZOOM\n\n               A clear, unobstructed picture of Jack and Ramirez up close.\n\n               CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... The rapid CLICKING stops \n               only when the view of the two is blocked again by other \n               people.\n\n               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BEER HALL - DUSK\n\n               Ramirez emerges from the beer hall. He heads back to his \n               motorbike.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Seconds later, the two KGB come out. This time, only Andrei \n               takes after Ramirez. Ivan gets into a taxi which heads in an \n               opposite direction.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MANSION - NIGHT\n\n               Reaching the mansion, Ramirez discreetly steals his way toward \n               its back wall. Then, just as slyly as he earlier had \n               materialized, he disappears.\n\n               ON VLADIMIR AT HIS POST\n\n               Watching Ramirez vanish into the mansion wall.\n\n               EXT. RAMIREZ'S HIDING PLACE - NEAR MANSION - NIGHT\n\n               He lies in the thick bushes, completely obscured from anyone's \n               view and now he removes the blond wig and the rest of his \n               disguise. Underneath his \"disguise\" clothes, he is wearing a \n               pair of black jeans and black T-shirt. He looks exactly like \n               Carlos now.\n\n               PRODUCTION NOTE: IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING \n               ON HERE. THE REAL CARLOS HAS NOT DYED HIS HAIR BLOND. THIS \n               WAS NOT THE REASON FOR RAMIREZ PUTTING ON A BLOND WIG. THE \n               LOGIC HERE IS THAT IF THE \"REAL CARLOS\" WERE IN FACT GOING \n               TO A MEET WITH A CIA AGENT, HE WOULD HAVE PUT ON SUCH A \n               DISGUISE TO MAKE SURE HE WAS NOT SPOTTED BY THE RUSSIANS.\n\n               INT. BLACK VOLGA - EAST BERLIN - NIGHT\n\n               Jack takes off his disguise as he drives the Volga to the \n               appointed corner of Carlos' compound.

KGB HEADQUARTERS - EAST BERLIN - NIGHT CLOSE ON MONITOR \n               SCREEN\n\n               A head shot of Ramirez in his latest blond, bearded disguise. \n               Grainy and blurred at first, it's gradually being brought \n               into sharp focus.\n\n               PULL BACK to reveal a GROUP OF MEN closely watching the screen \n               of an impressive, state-of-the-art computer. We recognize \n               only one of them. Andrei. At the computer's sophisticated \n               keyboard -- manipulating the images on the screen -- are TWO \n               TECHNICIANS in white overalls. Right behind them stands the \n               Head KGB Officer from Moscow and his Aide.\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                              (orders the technicians)\n                         [Now Carlos.]\n\n               ON SCREEN\n\n               It bisects, to allow a picture of the real Jackal (the \n               splitting image of Ramirez) to appear on the right half of \n               the screen.\n\n               BACK TO SCENE\n\n               The Head KGB Officer puts on his glasses and takes a closer \n               look at the monitor.\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                         [The beard and moustache.]\n\n               One of the two technicians toys with the keyboard.\n\n               CLOSE - SCREEN\n\n               The beard and moustache on Ramirez' disguised image slowly \n               disappear.

Just as furtively, \n               armed KGB -- led by the Head KGB Officer and his Aide move \n               in through the still-open door.\n\n               EXT.

MANSION\n\n               Meeting no resistance on the ground floor -- whose security \n               apparently has been the task of the MFS -- the intruders \n               climb the open, spiral staircase. They move cautiously, \n               silencer-equipped weapons in hand.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Reaching the upper floor, they hear the muffled sound of \n               RHYTHMIC MUSIC coming from the far end of the hallway to \n               their right. The Head KGB Officer motions his Aide to move \n               into the corridor to their left. He does, taking three KGB \n               with him. Four others -- including Andrei and Ivan -- follow \n               the Head KGB Officer into the hallway to their right.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY\n\n               It's long, with several rooms on each side. As Vladimir moves \n               gingerly into the first one, Ivan covers him from the door.\n\n               INT. ROOM\n\n               Illuminated only by the light which filters through the open \n               door, the room is quite dark. A faint sound of SNORING reaches \n               Andrei from the bed closest to the door. Quickly there, his \n               arm goes up. Then, for a split second, the flash of metal as \n               the knife comes down hard. The victim's last MURMUR. Followed \n               by the SOUND OF MOVEMENT at the other bed.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               In the beam of Ivan's flashlight, a waking JAPANESE is \n               reaching for his gun. Pffft. Pfffft. And he too falls back \n               to sleep. Eternally.\n\n               INT. ANOTHER ROOM - MANSION\n\n               TWO more JAPANESE in the midst of a Go game meet the same \n               fate.

OUTSIDE CARLOS' BEDROOM\n\n               Quietly approaching the carved-wood doors, a KGB tries the \n               knobs. The doors are locked. Suddenly, the pulsating LATIN \n               BEAT which emanated continuously from behind the doors, stops.\n\n               ON HEAD KGB OFFICER\n\n               He's startled by the sudden silence.\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                              (whispering)\n                         [Quick!

CARLOS' BEDROOM - MANSION ON CARLOS' BED\n\n               The voluptuous blonde -- her body glazed with post-coitus \n               sweat -- is paralyzed with fear; covering her prized assets \n               seems the last thing on her mind. She gapes at the KGB \n               marauders with wide, blue eyes. Not so, Ramirez's look-alike. \n               Caught reaching from under the sheets to replace the tape in \n               the stereo by the bed, he instinctively tries for his gun.\n\n               ON HEAD KGB OFFICER\n\n               Standing at the door.

And it's no use \n                         looking behind me... Your associates \n                         can no longer be of assistance.

He then hands the blonde -- who finally hides \n               her bazooms behind a sheet -- her clothes.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (continuing; getting \n                              dressed)\n                         That's what was going on in Libya. \n                         The CIA... The DST... They're trying \n                         to set me up and you're falling for \n                         it, you idiot!\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                         Enough. We tailed you to your meeting. \n                         We have the pictures of you with \n                         Shaw.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                         That's impossible.

All night...\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                              (unimpressed)\n                         We know about your women... Now hurry \n                         up, both of you!\n\n               ON IVAN AND VLADIMIR\n\n               With Kalashnikovs still trained on Carlos, they seem unable \n               to resist stealing glances at the blonde.\n\n                                     CARLOS\n                              (to Head KGB Officer)\n                         I'll prove it to you. You'll be \n                         pleading for my forgiveness. Let's \n                         just go. I want to be interrogated. \n                         I demand to be interrogated.\n\n               He seems truly eager to leave with them now, as if confident \n               he can prove his case. Dressed, with the exception of a \n               jacket, he casually grabs one which lies on a nearby chair.\n\n                                     HEAD KGB OFFICER\n                         WAIT!\n\n               Too late. The Scorpion machine-pistol is already out, spouting \n               deadly accurate fire. He kills the Head KGB Officer first, \n               then...\n\n               ON KGB\n\n               They drop like flies, their bullets hitting everything but \n               him.\n\n               ON BLONDE\n\n               Hysterical, she screams her healthy lungs out.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - MANSION\n\n               Suddenly there's the sound of APPROACHING STEPS. The KGB are \n               down the corridor, rushing to the bedroom, led by the Aide.\n\n               ON CARLOS\n\n               He doesn't hesitate. Firing a few rounds at them, he sprints \n               toward the window and literally flies through its shattering \n               glass.\n\n               EXT. MANSION - TREES - NIGHT\n\n               Ramirez lies in some bushes about fifty yards from the house, \n               dressed in the black jeans and T-shirt. He hears the gunfire \n               from the mansion.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         What the fuck?\n\n               EXT. MANSION COURTYARD\n\n               It's a dark night, and only a few dim lights illuminate the \n               rather large back yard.\n\n               ON CARLOS\n\n               Landing in a bed of flowers, he rolls, and is quickly on his \n               feet with the machine-pistol in hand.\n\n               ON TWO ARMED KGB\n\n               Securing the courtyard, they rush to the spot where, \n               apparently, they'd seen him land. Carlos, however, is no \n               longer there.\n\n               ANGLE\n\n               Glued to the back of a tree, the Jackal cuts them down with \n               one short burst and goes for the KGBs who appear at the broken \n               window. As they take cover, he quickly confiscates a \n               Kalashnikov from the dead KGB closest to him and makes it to \n               the high wall which encircles the place.\n\n               Carlos climbs over the wall with the Kalashnikov and drops \n               outside the compound to the grass below.\n\n               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ IN THE GRASS\n\n               He sees to his horror that Carlos is getting away. He is \n               ready to scream, going crazy. He has no gun, he wouldn't \n               stand a chance against Carlos, but there is no way he is \n               going to let him get away, no way. He looks around for a \n               rock... anything.\n\n               There is nothing. Carlos turns his back. Ramirez sees his \n               chance, he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when \n               suddenly he sees two more KGB guys come running around the \n               wall of the compound.\n\n               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ\n\n               He mouths the words:\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Kill him... Kill him...\n\n               ANGLE ON CARLOS\n\n               He whirls and fires at the two KGBs who fall.\n\n               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ\n\n               He can't believe it. Carlos is getting away?\n\n               ANGLE ON CARLOS\n\n               He suddenly gets a look as if he feels someone's presence. \n               His eyes open wide and he starts to turn when Ramirez comes \n               flying out of the darkness and leaps on Carlos. The two are \n               dressed exactly alike. Carlos is hit from behind and is \n               stunned and drops the assault rifle.\n\n               Ramirez has Carlos down and is choking him. Carlos looks up \n               at him more shocked than anything else. Finally Carlos manages \n               to break the grasp and kicks Ramirez off. Now it is a dazzling \n               display of martial arts. Then Ramirez charges Carlos and \n               tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and \n               darkness. When they roll out of the bushes we have no idea \n               which one is which or who we should be rooting for. Just \n               then Jack's Volga drives up at the side.\n\n               ANGLE ON THE TWO CARLOSES\n\n               They roll over onto the bodies of two dead KGB. There is a \n               Kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the Carlos on the \n               bottom's side. The Carlos who is on top manages to get his \n               finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into \n               the Carlos on the bottom's body. Just then the Carlos on top \n               looks up and sees Jack standing over him with a gun pointed \n               at him ready to shoot. In b.g. we HEAR cars with sirens \n               approaching. The Carlos on top looks over to Jack who is \n               ready to shoot him.\n\n                                     CARLOS ON TOP\n                         Don't shoot. It's me you asshole!\n\n               Jack just stares at him and then lowers his gun.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Let's get the fuck out of here.\n\n               He turns around and starts to get into the Volga. The Carlos \n               on top, whom we just thought was Ramirez bends down and \n               reaches for the dead KGB's pistol.\n\n               ANGLE ON JACK\n\n               He gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around, his gun \n               raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol. \n               Is it Carlos or Ramirez, who is standing there with pistol \n               in hand almost turned to Jack but still at a disadvantage in \n               this Mexican stand off.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Have you come looking for me now, \n                         Annibal?\n\n                                     THE MAN WITH THE PISTOL\n                         What the fuck are you talking about...\n\n                                     JACK\n                         Awfully warm for this time of year \n                         isn't it?\n\n               The man with the pistol knows this is a password of some \n               kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesn't \n               have an answer. Jack is just about to shoot him when a burst \n               of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and \n               it rips into the tree next to Jack who dives for cover.\n\n               That act of self-preservation gives the man we now realize \n               is the real Carlos the chance he needs. With catlike grace \n               he dives, rolls and vanishes into the shadows. He has gotten \n               away and Jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry \n               or rescue his friend. He opts for the latter, scoops up \n               Annibal and throws him into the Volga and speeds off as cars \n               approach from the other side.\n\n               EXT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY - ESTABLISHING\n\n               INT. PRIVATE ROOM - BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n               Ramirez is in bed, hooked up to all the monitors and tubes \n               and IVs but he is going to make it. Jack is there with him, \n               having just entered.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Any word?\n\n                                     JACK\n                         How you feeling?\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Did he get away?\n\n               Jack nods his head. Ramirez almost breaks down in tears. \n               Jack crosses to him to comfort him.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Then it was all for nothing... the \n                         whole thing.\n\n                                     JACK\n                         No it wasn't. He's finished. The KGB \n                         bought it. As far as they're \n                         concerned, he's the enemy now. He'll \n                         bounce around from one country to \n                         the next. But his paymasters have \n                         disowned him. None of their client \n                         states will risk using him. No one'll \n                         trust him again. He'll spend the \n                         rest of his life looking over his \n                         shoulder waiting to be betrayed. And \n                         it'll happen... sooner or later... \n                         when it's to some country's \n                         advantage... they'll give him up or \n                         they'll trade him. He's finished. It \n                         worked and he's finished.\n\n                                     RAMIREZ\n                         Not for me he isn't...

We \n               hear the sound of a car door opening. And then the key turning \n               in an ignition. And then the door is blown off the garage as \n               we see the Ramirez family car burst into an inferno and blaze \n               away inside the garage in a fiery blast which would kill one \n               and all instantly.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT.

At the back of it \n               all stands Jack wearing sunglasses, his face a mask into \n               which it is impossible to read any emotion of any kind. There \n               are four graves and four coffins, two adult-sized and two \n               small ones.

He knocks on the door. The door opens... it is \n               Ramirez... or Carlos... we don't know which.

Several years older, but unmistakable. He takes \n               off the old man's clothes and stuffs them in a trash can and \n               underneath he wears the black jeans and T-shirt.
