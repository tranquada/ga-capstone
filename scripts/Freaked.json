Widen to\r\n          reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to\r\n          camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff\r\n          movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES\r\n          photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind\r\n          Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his\r\n          entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT\r\n          GUIDE.\r\n           2.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Further off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD\r\n          CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed\r\n          expressions.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           (through a clenched smile)\r\n           So, what kind of crap do you\r\n           scumbags want me to peddle?\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Everything.

Flash.\r\n                         \r\n          The assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal\r\n          container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it.\r\n          Hertz gives it to Rick.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro-\r\n           fertilizer.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Fertilizer?

Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls\r\n          after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Rick. Wait!

He shakes his head at Rick.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Rick, Rick, Rick... You want\r\n           proof? Fine. Just take a seat.\r\n           Please.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table,\r\n          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a\r\n          placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an\r\n          aide, who scurries off.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n                          (TO RICK)\r\n           Meet the head of our South American\r\n           research facility, Juan Valdez.\r\n                         \r\n          The aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a\r\n          natty three-piece suit and a sombrero.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n           My name is George Ramirez.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Whatever. He's worked with Noxon\r\n           24 every day for five years, and\r\n           he's in fine shape. Aren't you,\r\n           Juan?\r\n                         \r\n          George glares at Hertz bitterly. Hertz stares him down.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n           Yes. I am fine. Me and my team in\r\n           Santa Flan have--\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Santa \"Flan?\" What kind of shitty\r\n           name for a country is that?\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n           It is named for the patron saint of\r\n           creamy desserts... As I was\r\n           saying, we've worked very closely\r\n           with Noxon...\r\n           4.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          Rick nods. We cut back to George, but he isn't George\r\n          anymore. He has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the\r\n          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n           I personally supervised its\r\n           development...\r\n                         \r\n          Rick furrows his brow. He's a little suspicious of George's\r\n          transformation, but just a little.\r\n                         \r\n          Now George is even shorter, even swarthier. Yet another\r\n          actor.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n           I performed rigorous scientific\r\n           tests. No potential danger was\r\n           left uninvestigated...\r\n                         \r\n          Rick's suspicion is increasing. He looks over to Hertz, who\r\n          feigns total innocence.\r\n                         \r\n          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His\r\n          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down\r\n          over his face.\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE (CONT'D)\r\n           The environmentalists are\r\n           crackpots, all of them.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick looks at his entourage. Their mouths hang open in\r\n          astonishment.\r\n                         \r\n          George has now shrunk to near-midget proportions. The\r\n          sombrero completely covers his head. When he takes it off,\r\n          we see he's now played by LINDA HUNT!\r\n                         \r\n                          GEORGE\r\n           It's ridiculous, I tell you.\r\n           Totally ridiculous!\r\n                         \r\n          Rick is ready to ask questions, but Hertz cuts him off.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Thank you, Valdez. That will be\r\n           all.\r\n                         \r\n          George nods and heads back to his seat. As he passes behind\r\n          Hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and\r\n          making a face.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Wait a second--\r\n           5.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Ricky, this is important. We're\r\n           talking about a major threat to the\r\n           EES image. How does 2 million\r\n           dollars plus expenses sound?\r\n                         \r\n          The aide reveals a new placard on the easel. It reads \"$2\r\n          MILLION.\"\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Look, it sounds great, but--\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           I hear you.

The old\r\n          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were\r\n          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.\r\n                         \r\n                          HERTZ\r\n           Good, it's unanimous.

He grabs Kevin's head and screams in\r\n          a new, monstrous voice.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           EAT SHIT!\r\n                         \r\n          POP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft.\r\n          The head stares down at Rick in disbelief.\r\n                         \r\n                          KEVIN'S HEAD\r\n           Now you're just being childish.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits.\r\n          The crowd panics and charges for the exits.\r\n                         \r\n                          CROWD\r\n           AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF\r\n           HERE!\r\n                         \r\n          People are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair\r\n          Cooke is crushed under the stampede.\r\n           50.\r\n                         \r\n          The freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly.\r\n          Elijah looks on, intrigued.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELIJAH\r\n           Now that's entertainment.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Rick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches\r\n          JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly\r\n          playing a game of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" The cubicles contain\r\n          large blank blocks, like the \"letters\" on the game show. So\r\n          far, there's a \"D\", two \"S\"s, and a \"K\" revealed. Rosie the\r\n          Pinhead plays Vanna White's role.\r\n                         \r\n                          NOSEY\r\n           I'd like to buy a vowel.\r\n                         \r\n          The Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in?\r\n                         \r\n          Juan advances towards Rick, sneering.\r\n                         \r\n                          JUAN\r\n           So. Now you don't mind mixing with\r\n           us--how did you say it--sorry\r\n           mutants?\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Look! I'm sorry for what happened\r\n           at the show. Can't you just forget\r\n           it?\r\n                         \r\n          He shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a\r\n          human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off,\r\n          embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the\r\n          silence.\r\n                         \r\n                          ERNIE\r\n           Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about\r\n           your big escape plan?\r\n                         \r\n          Juan gives Ernie a nasty \"shut up\" look. He growls at him.\r\n                         \r\n                          ERNIE\r\n           Well, excuse me for living.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           You have an escape plan?\r\n                         \r\n                          JUAN\r\n           Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a\r\n           simple diversion.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n           51.\r\n                          JUAN(CONT'D)\r\n           Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks\r\n           cry out for freedom!\r\n           Aooooooorrraaaagh!\r\n                         \r\n          Juan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're\r\n          a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it.\r\n                         \r\n                          FREAKS\r\n           Aoo...\r\n                         \r\n          Beat.\r\n                         \r\n                          JULIE\r\n           Juan's plan is really ingenious\r\n           Rick. See, he figured out that--\r\n                         \r\n                          JUAN\r\n           I figured out that our escape does\r\n           not include the Beast Boy. No one\r\n           may discuss the plan with him,\r\n           understand?\r\n                         \r\n          Juan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble\r\n          agreement.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           What's the matter with all of you?\r\n           You trust your lives to a guy just\r\n           'cause he can lick his own\r\n           privates?\r\n                         \r\n          The freaks ponder this a second, then nod \"yes\".\r\n                         \r\n                          ERNIE\r\n           You gotta admit, Coog, it's a\r\n           helluva trick.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n                          (RESENTFUL)\r\n           Fine!

Look, Juan's a good dog, a\r\n           smart dog. I'll talk to him.\r\n           Don't be stupid, Rick.

The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board\r\n          light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal \"Crud Sucking\r\n          Pus Monkeys\" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite\r\n          themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes\r\n          deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is\r\n          watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her\r\n          attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg\r\n          instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried.\r\n                         \r\n                          ERNIE\r\n           I'm getting a bad feeling here.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          INT. REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Out of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door\r\n          and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Damn.\r\n                         \r\n          He peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN\r\n          getting out of his truck in the driveway.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n                          (TO MILKMAN)\r\n           Psst!

Sorry to bother\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n          The milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back\r\n          door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into\r\n          his \"act.\"\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           (in a lusty womanish\r\n                          VOICE)\r\n           Ooohh...

We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his\r\n          soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit\r\n          complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing.\r\n           54.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling\r\n          casually. He notices something. It's ...\r\n                         \r\n          THE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD\r\n                         \r\n          Its big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter\r\n          plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing\r\n          \"YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI\") Rick gets to the truck\r\n          and tries the door. It's locked.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Shit.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring\r\n          at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and\r\n          looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked\r\n          too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again.\r\n                         \r\n          Rick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and\r\n          runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked\r\n          too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something\r\n          else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning\r\n          against Elijah's porch. They're locked too.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           Damn!

Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE\r\n          behind him, spins around and faces ...\r\n                         \r\n          TWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS\r\n                         \r\n          with little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and\r\n          aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at\r\n          Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big\r\n          spliff.\r\n                         \r\n                          RICK\r\n           AHHHH!\r\n                         \r\n          A T.V.

Finding no place to deposit\r\n          Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a\r\n          little hurt.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           What does today's businessman want?\r\n           How about a receptionist with six\r\n           arms, five mouths, and a knockout\r\n           figure? That'd sure speed things\r\n           up, wouldn't it?\r\n                         \r\n          With a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi-\r\n          limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different\r\n          phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once.\r\n                         \r\n          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the\r\n          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,\r\n          who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe\r\n          there's a few things we don't know about him.\r\n           85.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          BILL\r\n           In the factory, how 'bout a worker\r\n           with twelve busy hands, no mouth to\r\n           talk back, and no genitalia or\r\n           digestive system to distract him\r\n           from his work?\r\n                          (HE CHUCKLES)\r\n           Sure!

He brushes\r\n          up against the back of Elijah's legs.\r\n                         \r\n          Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again.\r\n          Elijah looks away quickly, panicky.\r\n                         \r\n                          BILL (CONT'D)\r\n           Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon\r\n           technology, it's not only possible,\r\n           it's just the beginning! Of\r\n           course, what happened to our\r\n           expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan\r\n           was an unfortunate coincidence, but\r\n           profits from these new markets\r\n           could total in the billions.\r\n                         \r\n          All the executives turn to Hertz.

Stuey glances across the room\r\n          to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does.\r\n                         \r\n                          ELIJAH\r\n           Hey!

The security goons\r\n          are strategically situated throughout the tent, and two of\r\n          them sit on either side of Stuey in the second row.

On stage left there's a\r\n          large cage containing all the other freaks. Including the\r\n          unconscious, half-naked Milk Man who Rick knocked out in the\r\n          freak house. The Milk Man domes to, looks around in a panic,\r\n          grabs the bars of the cage, and screams--\r\n                         \r\n                          MILK MAN\r\n           AAHHHH!

Rick hears Stuey's voice\r\n          echo in his head telepathically.\r\n                         \r\n           STUEY (V.0.)\r\n           Rick!

The biker pulls a\r\n          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade\r\n          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He\r\n          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike.

Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him\r\n          flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over\r\n          the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye\r\n          target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of\r\n          bravado, Elijah makes a last stand.\r\n           99.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n                          ELIJAH\r\n           Come on, Coogan!

I learned somethin'\r\n           too. That men and women truly are\r\n           equals. That the human spirit\r\n           transcends gender and physical\r\n           appearance, and thus it is immune\r\n           to the petty degradations men may\r\n           devise. I believe it was Moliere\r\n                          WHO SAID--\r\n                         \r\n          Julie's had enough.

The HIT SINGLE from the soundtrack\r\n          album kicks in as we...\r\n                         \r\n                         ROLL CREDITS\r\n                         \r\n          As the credits roll, and everybody continues to smile and\r\n          wave at the cheering audience, Elijus and Elly Lee attack\r\n          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.\r\n          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they\r\n          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them\r\n          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and\r\n          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely\r\n          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts\r\n          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand\r\n          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has\r\n          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down\r\n          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,\r\n          charging everyone five bucks per blow.\r\n                         \r\n          As we fade, everyone's having a go flipping, throwing,\r\n          kicking and impaling rag doll replicas of America's favorite\r\n          morning show hosts.\r\n                         \r\n           THE END?!\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nFreaked\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Tim Burns\u00a0\u00a0Tom Stern\u00a0\u00a0Alex Winter\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:25:24.438785"}
