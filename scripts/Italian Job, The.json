HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT\n\n               Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded \n               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve \n               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the \n               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his \n               bubble gum.\n\n                                     HANDSOME ROB\n                         Can you chill out back there? You'd \n                         make a hummingbird nervous.\n\n               EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT\n\n               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his \n               gear.\n\n                                     HALF-EAR\n                         I'm done. Over.\n\n                                     LYLE (V.O.)\n                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.\n\n               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted \n               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into \n               deeper water.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS\n\n               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John \n               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion \n               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at \n               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.\n\n               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the \n               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's \n               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the \n               crate in the ship.\n\n               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT\n\n               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.\n\n               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:\n\n                                     LYLE (V.O.)\n                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.\n\n               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed \n               by just above his head. WHOOSH.\n\n               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.\n\n               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT\n\n               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.\n\n               INT. SHIP'S HOLD\n\n               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate \n               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through \n               the cavity, vanishing.\n\n               UNDERWATER\n\n               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.\n\n               ON THE SHIP\n\n               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. \n               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT\n\n               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to \n               the bay through infrared binoculars.\n\n               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to \n               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.\n\n               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT\n\n               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting \n               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.\n\n               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.\n\n               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard \n               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.\n\n               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...\n\n               A large safe.\n\n               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light \n               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.\n\n               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels \n               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.\n\n               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their \n               headsets, heard by all.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Sweet Jesus.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         \"That for which all virtue is sold. \n                         And almost every vice -- gold.\"\n\n               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD \n               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one \n               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're \n               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT\n\n               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be \n               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared \n               binoculars and sees --\n\n               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then \n               disappear.\n\n               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER\n\n               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.\n\n               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a \n               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves \n               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.\n\n               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing \n               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, \n               going along for the ride.\n\n               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which \n               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through \n               the water towards the secluded beach, we...\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN\n\n               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)\n\n               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.\n\n               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in \n               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are \n               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who \n               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         My name is John and I'm a very rich \n                         alcoholic. And I'm going to live my \n                         life one very rich day at a time.\n\n                                     THE CREW\n                         Alright, John!\n\n               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the \n               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As \n               Bridger lights it for him --\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         You planned this one down to a t, \n                         kid. It's a gift. You saw the big \n                         picture, made contingencies, covered \n                         the angles...\n\n               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         Shit, you made thirty million dollars \n                         in gold drop out of sight without \n                         holding a gun. Who else could've \n                         pulled that off?\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         You could've. I had big shoes to \n                         fill.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         Fill the shoes but don't follow the \n                         footprints.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         What're you talking about? You've \n                         lived the life.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         My life's been nothing but fake IDs, \n                         fake business cards and divorce \n                         papers. This is the only thing that's \n                         real.\n\n               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in \n               his wallet.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Stella's a beautiful girl.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         She's amazing. And I spent half her \n                         childhood in prison. This is a once \n                         in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring \n                         down the curtain after this one. \n                         Make a new life. Find someone amazing \n                         and be there for her.\n\n               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD\n\n               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks \n               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.\n\n                                     HANDSOME ROB\n                         Shit.\n\n               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed \n               against Handsome Rob's temple.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Anyone acts stupid and his brains go \n                         on the windshield.\n\n               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-\n               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.\n\n               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         What the hell do you think you're \n                         doing?\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of \n                         Cracker Jack all to myself.\n\n               The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the \n               Humvee.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         You're not thinking this through. \n                         It's a stupid move.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         Think so? Well you're the brilliant \n                         one. The Master Planner. Isn't that \n                         so, John?\n\n               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, \n               the AK-47s aimed at the others.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         You bet on the wrong horse.\n\n                                     JOHN BRIDGER\n                         We'll hunt you down.

HUMVEE\n\n               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.\n\n                                     STEVE\n                         No regrets, Dixie cup.\n\n               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.\n\n               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of \n               full automatic fire at the crew.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE\n\n               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.\n\n               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter \n               of hell.\n\n               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.\n\n               Driving blind.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD\n\n               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, \n               metal tearing against metal.\n\n               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff \n               and the raging water below.\n\n               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.\n\n               EXT. HUMVEE\n\n               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.\n\n               It careens off the road and --\n\n               SERIES OF SHOTS\n\n               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the \n               raging river.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE\n\n               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown \n               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger \n               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is \n               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie \n               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.\n\n               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not \n               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.\n\n               EXT. WATERFALL\n\n               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.\n\n               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser \n               of water.\n\n               It sinks out of sight.\n\n               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME\n\n               The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep.

MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN\n\n               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the \n               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.\n\n               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.\n\n               INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME\n\n               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot \n               mists the water red.\n\n               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but \n               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body \n               and pulls it up with him.\n\n               EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE\n\n               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie \n               pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, \n               and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, \n               he holds Bridger.

A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while \n               trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.\n\n               SUPERIMPOSE:\n\n                              Three Years Later Philadelphia\n\n               She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever \n               and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of \n               pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS \n               TURN ON.\n\n               TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.\n\n                                     FIRST COP\n                         You always work in the dark?\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         Buzz of the fluorescents throws me \n                         off.

STREET - DAY\n\n               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini \n               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low \n               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives \n               it the legendary Mini look.\n\n               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't \n               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile \n               soul.\n\n               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY\n\n               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind \n               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo \n               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the \n               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.\n\n               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.\n\n               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two \n               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.\n\n               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with \n               ease. She's right in front of --\n\n               HER SHOP\n\n               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with \n               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER \n               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a \n               poised walk she heads inside.\n\n               INT.

Like this...\n\n               He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.\n\n                                     RICHARD\n                         I hit each woman on the jury with \n                         one of these. We make contact. And I \n                         know exactly what they're doing. \n                         Undressing me with their eyes.\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         I see...\n\n               What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, \n               \"Excuse me.\" Nightmare continues...\n\n                                     RICHARD\n                         The case is all but won. That's why \n                         in jury selection I choose as many \n                         women as possible. Except lesbians, \n                         of course. I can tell in sixty seconds \n                         if they're a lesbian. Want to know \n                         how I know?\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         If they don't undress you with their \n                         eyes?\n\n                                     RICHARD\n                         Precisely. Like that waitress right \n                         there. See? She's looking at me right \n                         below my belt. Definitely not a \n                         lesbian.\n\n               A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella \n               notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper \n               is all the way down. She smiles.\n\n                                     STELLA\n                         Your fly.\n\n                                     RICHARD\n                         I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait \n                         until later tonight.\n\n               Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking \n               Richard's suit in red wine.\n\n                                     BUSBOY\n                         Oh, man. I'm sorry.\n\n                                     RICHARD\n                         You should be. Moron. What the hell's \n                         wrong with you?\n\n                                     BUSBOY\n                         It was an accident.

Richard Worth \n                         is not paying to have his suit \n                         cleaned. Damn.\n                              (to Stella)\n                         I'm going to...

BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n               OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, \n               that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the \n               bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. \n               Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His \n               eyes flash open.\n\n               He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her \n               pants and removes her key chain.\n\n               He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: \n               he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against \n               the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.\n\n               He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past \n               her panties, past her bra and.\n\n               He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.\n\n               INT.

He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a \n               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable \n               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers \n               to disconnect one of the cables.\n\n               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\n               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee.

The bumper \n               tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about \n               to make another charge.\n\n               INT. STELLA'S MINI\n\n               She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds \n               herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks \n               the wheel right to avoid a collision.\n\n               INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK\n\n               The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he \n               turns away from the Mini and --\n\n               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA\n\n               The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs \n               all over the road, water exploding into the air and --\n\n               The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the \n               hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.\n\n               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.\n\n               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It \n               slams into the water truck.\n\n               EXT. 5TH STREET\n\n               Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong \n               way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both \n               cars stop just in time.\n\n               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps \n               out, furious.\n\n                                     FURIOUS DRIVER\n                         What's wrong with you, you stupid-\n                         ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...\n\n               As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari \n               and walks towards the furious driver.\n\n                                     FURIOUS DRIVER\n                         What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, \n                         dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling \n                         peanuts out of your asshole --\n\n               BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.\n\n                                     FURIOUS DRIVER\n                         Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!\n\n               While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into \n               the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the \n               same time --\n\n               INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET\n\n               Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union \n               Station. Clear sailing for him.\n\n               He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And \n               he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived \n               in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the \n               empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.\n\n                                     LYLE\n                         Where are you going?\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         Away.\n\n                                     LYLE\n                         How about far, far away?\n\n                                     KAREN\n                         The farther the better.\n\n               EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY\n\n               Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the \n               motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up \n               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed \n               right at him.\n\n               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI\n\n               He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, \n               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel \n               Figueroa.\n\n               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the \n               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with \n               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers\n\n               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)\n\n               Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking \n               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded \n               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the \n               Mini.\n\n               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI\n\n               He's got no place else to go...\n\n               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA\n\n               The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby \n               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult \n               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted \n               palm trees.\n\n               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the \n               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The \n               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.\n\n                                     CHARLIE\n                         Going up?\n\n               INT. ELEVATOR\n\n               The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches \n               out the window, presses the button for ROOF.\n\n               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber \n               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.\n\n               The door closes just in time.\n\n               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people \n               screaming at the sight of the guns.\n\n               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY\n\n               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.\n\n               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is \n               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow \n               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.\n\n               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI\n\n               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big \n               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red \n               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even \n               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.\n\n               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and \n               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not \n               about to abandon ship.\n\n               EXT. ROOFTOP\n\n               So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the \n               first tower and in --\n\n               EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS\n\n               His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground \n               deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a \n               football...\n\n               NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP\n\n               The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, \n               looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising \n               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.\n\n               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of \n               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it \n               forward --\n\n               I/E CHARLIE'S MINI\n\n               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards \n               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to \n               the last elevator, skids to a stop.\n\n               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his \n               shoulder to witness --\n\n               THE MOTORCYCLE\n\n               going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop \n               jump.\n\n               But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...\n\n               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...\n\n               Towards a large window on the top floor...\n\n               Then lower...\n\n               And the look on the driver's face says it all as...\n\n               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of \n               the building, just below the window.\n\n               The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH \n               through the window as --\n\n               A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the \n               LAPD chopper and --\n\n               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA\n\n               The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass \n               shards.\n\n               I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER\n\n               Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot \n               keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING \n               THROB, the injured chopper banks away.\n\n               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY\n\n               PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out \n               then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT.

Feels like she's home free.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT.

She gets \n               out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.\n\n               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT\n\n               The \"All Aboard\" announcement goes out over the PA system.\n\n               Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly \n               picking up speed.\n\n               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT\n\n               The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. \n               Champagne is poured.

Looks around. \n               It's safe.\n\n               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING \n               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.\n\n               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic \n               face of a Balinese girl on each one.\n\n               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.\n\n               These bricks are real.\n\n               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks \n               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.\n\n               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.\n\n               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.\n\n               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.\n\n               They cock their M-lls.\n\n               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.\n\n               Steve hears the sound from behind him.
