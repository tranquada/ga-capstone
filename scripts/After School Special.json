WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                    1\n     As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American\n     high school...\n1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A\n     ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the\n     unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.\n1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1B\n     The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light\n     from an open door...\n                          MATT (O.S.)\n                This is unwatchable. It's not even in\n                focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is\n                in the shot. This is really shoddy work.\n1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1C\n     The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a\n     TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.\n                          DEACON (O.S.)\n                Why do they always show the guy's face?\n                It's like, can't we just assume he's\n                enjoying it?\n     We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.\n                          FRED (O.S.)\n                Because they're trying to make us feel\n                like we're better looking than that guy,\n                so we should be able to get chicks as hot\n                as her.\n                          DEACON (O.S.)\n                How the hell do you know?\n                          FRED (O.S.)\n                It's a basic rule of porno.\n     Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.\n     They're watching the porno...\n2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2\n     ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can\n     still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their\n     book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.\n\n    FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        2.\n\n\n\n                        DEACON (V.O.)\n              It all started on my seventeenth birthday\n              with our usual morning routine: film\n              appreciation.\n    The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.\n                        FRED\n              Deacon! What are you doing? I was\n              watching that.\n                        DEACON\n              Come on, let's go. We're going to be\n              late.\n                        DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n              And when I say film appreciation, I mean\n              film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt\n              copies them, and I sell them.\n    Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.\n    The original plus four copies pop out.\n    CLOSE ON the original tape: \"Ramalot Productions presents\n    Dirty Darla #7,\" as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to\n    Deacon. They smile.\n3   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                   3\n    The guys are waiting in line for lunch.\n                        DEACON (V.O.)\n              Fred's the kind of kid who's basically\n              given up on high school. He figures his\n              glory days are way ahead of him.\n                        FRED\n              First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law,\n              then when I'm making a hundred grand a\n              year, I'll have a whole stable of hot\n              chicks sitting around topless on my\n              yacht.\n    He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.\n                        MATT\n                  (to Deacon)\n              Will that work?\n                        DEACON\n                  (to Fred)\n              You are a complete moron.\n    Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.\n                        FRED\n              What?\n\n    FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        3.\n\n\n\n4   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     4\n    The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image\n    that reads \"Fifteen Days Till Midterms.\"\n    Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.\n                        DEACON (V.O.)\n              Until that big payday, Fred's sex life\n              consists of spanking it.\n                        AMAZING GIRL\n              That test was sooo hard.\n    That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns\n    ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:\n5   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         5\n    Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there,\n    then enters a stall and locks the door.\n    He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the\n    toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet\n    paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred\n    pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.\n6   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     6\n    Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a\n    stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.\n                        HOT GIRL\n              We're going to be late. Are you coming?\n    Fred perks up.\n7   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         7\n    Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.\n                        DEACON (V.O.)\n              Fred averages two to five time a day,\n              depending on how many girls he sees in\n              the hallway.\n8   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     8\n    Matt is videotaping the students (including J.T. and Mark)\n    running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.\n                        DEACON (V.O.)\n              Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late\n              bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual\n              Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete\n              dork.\n\n      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        4.\n\n\n\n      J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping\n      him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing.\n      Fred shakes his head.\n                             FRED\n                   What are you doing?\n                             MATT\n                   All great directors start this way. I'm\n                   documenting the essence of high school.\n                   Teenagers running to meet their destiny\n                   only to find it's just home room. It's\n                   very existential.\n                             FRED\n                   So's my balls. See you later.\n\n9     OMITTED                                                             9\n10    INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY                                10\n      Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to\n      his bloody nose.\n                             DEACON (V.O.)\n                   In the normal course of things, Matt\n                   probably wouldn't even have been our\n                   friend, but Fred likes having someone to\n                   boss around, and I think Matt's actually\n                   pretty cool once you get to know him.\n      Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the\n      girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and\n      the door to the locker room closes slowly.\n      Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,\n      a sliver of daylight still visible.\n      Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the\n      boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too\n      immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.\n      He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He\n      turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.\n10A   MATT'S POV                                                        10A\n      The proverbial jackpot.

He quickly\n      scurries away.\n                             DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.)\n                   Well, at least he's got the key to the\n                   A/V room.\n\n     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     5.\n\n\n\n11   INT.

This\n               is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot\n               more than twenty dollars.\n                         DORKY FRESHMAN\n               Sweet.\n     He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the\n     tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.\n     Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees\n     a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.\n                         DEACON (V.O.)\n               People always talk about how tough it is\n               being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have\n               to watch one more TV movie about bulimia\n               or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...\n     Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some\n     CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some\n     books for class.\n                         DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D)\n               I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a\n               seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's\n               like to have only one thing on your mind\n               all day, every day, but to have\n               absolutely no way of getting it.\n12   INT.

I don't really have any evidence\n               to support that, but the point is, a\n               horny teenage boy will do almost anything\n               for even a glimpse of sex.\n     ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her\n     conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing\n     headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even\n     if you were alone with her on a two-man luge.

Suffering from a deep,\n               debilitating addiction to something we've\n               never even had.

Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole. She struts\n      by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take\n      dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's\n      Dad...\n      ... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin\n      around the pole...\n      and lands in a split, face to face with...\n      ...

LEWIS\n               You do?\n     Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards\n     his bedroom. Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly\n     concern and male jealously.\n92   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   92\n     Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. He\n     stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from\n     fifth grade. He looks really happy in the picture.\n     Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday\n     with Naomi. She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can\n     tell from his expression, they don't belong together.\n     He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk.\n93   EXT.
