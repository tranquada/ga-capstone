She walks by Matt without noticing, and\n      the door to the locker room closes slowly.\n      Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,\n      a sliver of daylight still visible.\n      Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the\n      boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too\n      immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.\n      He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door.
