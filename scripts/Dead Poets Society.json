WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nA young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother\nadjusts his tie.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n</b>\t\tNow remember, keep your shoulders back.\n\nA student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young\nboy and his brother line up for a photograph\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHER\n</b>\t\tOkay, put your arm around your brother.\n\t\tThat's it. And breathe in.\n\nThe young boy blinks as the flash goes off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHR\n</b>\t\tOkay, one more.\n\nAn old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old\nman's duties.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n</b>\t\tNow just to review, you're going to\n\t\tfollow along the procession until you\n\t\tget to the headmaster. At that point\n\t\the will indicate to you to light the\n\t\tcandles of the boys.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tAll right boys, let's settle down.\n\nThe various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding\nbanners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the\nbagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tBanners up.\n\nThe boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The\nsmall group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a\nchurch. The pews are filled with students and parents while the\nteachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church\nbehind the headmaster.\n\nThe boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The\nbagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old\nman carrying the candle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n</b>\t\tLadies and gentlemen, boys, the light\n\t\tof knowledge.\n\nAn organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands\nto the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and\nhe bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the\ncandle of the boy next to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n</b>\t\tOne hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this\n\t\troom and were asked the same question that greets\n\t\tyou at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what\n\t\tare the four pillars?\n\nAll throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who\nis not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOYS\n</b>\t\tTradition, honor, discipline, excellence.\n\nThe boys quickly return to their seats.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n</b>\t\tIn her first year, Welton Academy graduated five\n\t\tstudents. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And\n\t\tmore than seventy-five percent of those went on to\n\t\tthe Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is\n\t\tthe result of fervent dedication to the principles taught\n\t\there. This is why you parents have been sending us\n\t\tyour sons. This is why we are the best preparatory\n\t\tschool in the United States.\n\nMr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n</b>\t\tAs you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English\n\t\tdepartment retired last term. You will have the\n\t\topportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John\n\t\tKeating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,\n\t\tfor the past several years, has been teaching at the\n\t\thighly regarded Chester School in London.\n\nThe crowd applauds once again.\n\n<b>EXT.

Spaz's\nfather hands Hager various bottles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFATHER\n</b>\t\tThis is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you\n\t\tgive him one of these.

You know what I mean?\n\nHe pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd \nacross the back with it.\n\nCHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and\nMEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tRumor has it, you did summer school.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tYep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.\n\t\tHow was your summer Slick?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tKeen.\n\nThe boys enter the room.

Excrement.\n\nCharlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.\nMeanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tOkay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite\n\t\tflunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study\n\t\tgroup.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tSure. Cameron asked me too.

That's why I help him with Latin.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tAnd English, and Trig.\n\nCharlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly\nstamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke\nfrom the air.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tIt's open.\n\nThe door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from\nthe window.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tFather, I thought you'd gone.\n\nThe other boys stand up when he enters.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBOYS\n</b>\t\tMr. Perry.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n</b>\t\tKeep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've\n\t\tjust spoken to Mr. Nolan.

It wouldn't be fair.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n</b>\t\tFellas, would you excuse us for a moment?\n\nMr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry\npauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.\n\n<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY\n</b>\nThe smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n</b>\t\tDon't you ever dispute me in public.

Now listen, you need anything,\n\t\tyou let us know, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tYes sir.\n\nMr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head\nback against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n</b>\t\tWhy doesn't he let you do what you want?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNOX\n</b>\t\tYeah Neil, tell him off.

FIELDS - DAY\n</b>\nA clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently\ndisturbed by the noise, take to the sky.\n\n<b>INT. STAIRCASE - DAY\n</b>\nThe sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they\ndescend the stairs in a long spiralling line.\n\nMR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n</b>\t\tSlow down boys, slow down you horrible\n\t\tphalanx of pubescense.\n\n<b>INT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY\n</b>\nA teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n</b>\t\tPick three laboratory experiments from\n\t\tthe project list and report on them every\n\t\tfive weeks. The first twenty questions at\n\t\tthe end of chapter one are due tomorrow.\n\nThe students let out a collective groan.\n\n<b>INT.

Keating\nglances out from his room off to one side.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKNOX\n</b>\t\tHey Spaz, Spaz.\n\nSpaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper\nwhile Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\tBrain damage.\n\nThe students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,\nwhistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and\nout the door without a word. The students look around at one another,\nuncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tWell come on.\n\nHe gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab\ntheir books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. \n\n<b>INT.

Spaz blows his\nnose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tNot a clue? It's from a poem by Walt\n\t\tWhitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in\n\t\tthis class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,\n\t\tif you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,\n\t\tMy Captain.\n\nThe students laugh slightly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tNow let me dispel a few rumors so they\n\t\tdon't fester into facts. Yes, I too\n\t\tattended Hell-ton and survived. And no,\n\t\tat that time I was not the mental giant\n\t\tyou see before you. I was the intellectual\n\t\tequivalent of a ninety-eight pound\n\t\tweakling. I would go to the beach and\n\t\tpeople would kick copies of Byron in my\n\t\tface.\n\nThe boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all\nthis down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his\nhand.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tNow, Mr\u0085 Pitts. That's a rather\n\t\tunfortunate name.

Same haircuts. Full of hormones,\n\t\tjust like you. Invincible, just like you\n\t\tfeel. The world is their oyster. They\n\t\tbelieve they're destined for great things,\n\t\tjust like many of you. Their eyes are full\n\t\tof hope, just like you. Did they wait until\n\t\tit was too late to make from their lives\n\t\teven one iota of what they were capable?\n\t\tBecause you see gentlmen, these boys are\n\t\tnow fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen\n\t\treal close, you can hear them whisper their\n\t\tlegacy to you.

KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n</b>\nKeating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one\nof his books.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tGentlemen, open your text to page\n\t\ttwenty-one of the introduction. Mr.\n\t\tPerry, will you read the opening\n\t\tparagraph of the preface, entitled\n\t\t\"Understanding Poetry\"?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tUnderstanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans\n\t\tPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand\n\t\tpoetry, we must first be fluent with\n\t\tits meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.\n\t\tThen ask two questions: One, how artfully\n\t\thas the objective of the poem been\n\t\trendered, and two, how important is that\n\t\tobjective. Question one rates the poem's\n\t\tperfection, question two rates its\n\t\timportance. And once these questions have\n\t\tbeen answered, determining a poem's\n\t\tgreatest becomes a relatively simple\n\t\tmatter.\n\nKeating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tIf the poem's score for perfection is\n\t\tplotted along the horizontal of a graph,\n\t\tand its importance is plotted on the\n\t\tvertical, then calculating the total\n\t\tarea of the poem yields the measure of\n\t\tits greatness.\n\nKeating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students\ndutifully copy it down.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEIL\n</b>\t\tA sonnet by Byron may score high on the\n\t\tvertical, but only average on the\n\t\thorizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on\n\t\tthe other hand, would score high both\n\t\thorizontally and vertically, yielding a\n\t\tmassive total area, thereby revealing the\n\t\tpoem to be truly great. As you proceed\n\t\tthrough the poetry in this book, practice\n\t\tthis rating method. As your ability to\n\t\tevaluate poems in this matter grows, so\n\t\twill - so will your enjoyment and\n\t\tunderstanding of poetry.\n\nNeil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting\nacross from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from\nthe chalkboard with a smile.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tExcrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.\n\t\tEvans Pritchard.

I like Byron, I give\n\t\thim a 42, but I can't dance to it.\n\nCharlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tNow I want you to rip out that page.\n\nThe students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tGo on, rip out the entire page.

Now in my class you\n\t\twill learn to think for yourselves again.\n\t\tYou will learn to savor words and language.\n\t\tNo matter what anybody tells you, words and\n\t\tideas can change the world. I see that look\n\t\tin Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century\n\t\tliterature has nothing to do with going to\n\t\tbusiness school or medical school. Right?\n\t\tMaybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, \n\t\tthinking \"Yes, we should simply study our\n\t\tMr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter\n\t\tand go quietly about the business of\n\t\tachieving other ambitions.\" I have a little\n\t\tsecret for ya.

You \n\t\tdo admit to being a part of this Dead \n\t\tPoets Society?\n\nTodd says nothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR.

NOLAN\n</b>\t\tI have here a detailed description of \n\t\twhat occurred at your meetings. It \n\t\tdescribes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, \n\t\tencouraged you boys to organize this \n\t\tclub and to use it as a source of \n\t\tinspiration for reckless and self-\n\t\tindulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. \n\t\tKeating, both in and out of the \n\t\tclassroom, encouraged Neil Perry to \n\t\tfollow his obsession with acting when he \n\t\tknew all along it was against the \n\t\texplicit order of Neil's parents. It was \n\t\tMr. Keating's blatant abuse of his \n\t\tposition as teacher that led directly to \n\t\tNeil Perry's death. \n\nMr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of\npaper to Todd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tRead that document carefully, Todd. Very \n\t\tcarefully.\n\nTodd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of\nthe other four boys.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR.

Sign the paper, Todd.\n\nMr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take.\n\n<b>EXT.

The entire building is \n\t\taedificium.\n\nKeating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks\nup at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back.\n\n<b>INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\nKeating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window.\nInside, all his belongings have been packed up.\n\n<b>INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks\nas the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tSit.\n\nThe students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tI'll be teaching this class through \n\t\texams.

NOLAN\n</b>\t\tKindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\tWe skipped around a lot, sir. We covered \n\t\tthe Romantics and some of the chapters \n\t\ton Post Civil War literature. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tWhat about the Realists? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\tI believe we skipped most of that, sir. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tAll right, then, we'll start over. What \n\t\tis poetry?\n\nThere is a knock at the classroom door.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tCome.\n\nThe students look back as the door opens. They quickly turn\naway when hey see it is Keating.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tExcuse me. I came for my personals. \n\t\tShould I come back after class? \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tGet them now, Mr. Keating. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tGentlemen, turn to page 21 of the \n\t\tintroduction. Mr. Cameron, read aloud \n\t\tthe excellent essay by Dr. Pritchard on \n\t\t\"Understanding Poetry.\"\n\nTodd slowly closes his book. Keating opens the door to the tiny\nroom off the classroom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\tThat page has been ripped out, sir. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tWell, borrow somebody else's book. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\tThey're all ripped out, sir. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR.

NOLAN\n</b>\t\tNever mind.\n\nMr. Nolan takes his own book over to Cameron's desk and then\nslaps the open page.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tRead!\n\nAs Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts\nhis scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\t\"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans \n\t\tPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand \n\t\tpoetry, we must first be fluent with its \n\t\tmeter, rhyme and figures of speech, then \n\t\task two questions: 1) How artfully has \n\t\tthe objective of the poem been rendered \n\t\tand 2)...\"\n\nThe door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n</b>\t\t\"... How important is that objective? \n\t\tQuestion 1 rates the poem's perfection; \n\t\tquestion 2 rates its importance. And \n\t\tonce these questions have been answered, \n\t\tdetermining the poem's greatness becomes \n\t\ta relatively simple matter. If the \n\t\tpoem's score for perfection is plotted \n\t\ton the horizontal of a graph--\"\n\nKeating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the\nclassroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTODD\n</b>\t\tMr. Keating! They made everybody sign \n\t\tit. \n\nMr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tQuiet, Mr. Anderson. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTODD\n</b>\t\tYou gotta believe me. It's true. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tKEATING\n</b>\t\tI do believe you, Todd. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n</b>\t\tLeave, Mr. Keating. \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTODD\n</b>\t\tBut it wasn't his fault! \n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMR.

NOLAN\n</b>\t\tI said leave, Mr. Keating.\n\nKeating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens\nit, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTODD\n</b>\t\tO Captain!
