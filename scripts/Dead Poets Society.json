WELTON ACADEMY HALLWAY - DAY\n\nA young boy, dressed in a school uniform and cap, fidgets as his mother\nadjusts his tie.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER\n\t\tNow remember, keep your shoulders back.\n\nA student opens up a case and removes a set of bagpipes. The young\nboy and his brother line up for a photograph\n\n\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHER\n\t\tOkay, put your arm around your brother.\n\t\tThat's it. And breathe in.\n\nThe young boy blinks as the flash goes off.\n\n\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHR\n\t\tOkay, one more.\n\nAn old man lights a single candle. A teacher goes over the old\nman's duties.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n\t\tNow just to review, you're going to\n\t\tfollow along the procession until you\n\t\tget to the headmaster. At that point\n\t\the will indicate to you to light the\n\t\tcandles of the boys.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tAll right boys, let's settle down.\n\nThe various boys, including NEIL, KNOX, and CAMERON, line up holding\nbanners. Ahead of them is the old man, followed by the boy with the\nbagpipes with the two youngest boys at the front.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tBanners up.\n\nThe boys hoist the banners and the bagpipes begin to play loudly. The\nsmall group marches out of the room and down a set of stairs into a\nchurch. The pews are filled with students and parents while the\nteachers, all dressed in robes, are seated at the front of the church\nbehind the headmaster.\n\nThe boys break off to either side at the front of the church. The\nbagpipes cease and the headmaster, MR. NOLAN, walks over to the old\nman carrying the candle.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n\t\tLadies and gentlemen, boys, the light\n\t\tof knowledge.\n\nAn organ begins to play as the old man goes forward with shaking hands\nto the young boys in the front pew. Each boy is holding a candle and\nhe bends over to light the first one. Each boy in turn lights the\ncandle of the boy next to him.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n\t\tOne hundred years ago, in 1859, 41 boys sat in this\n\t\troom and were asked the same question that greets\n\t\tyou at the start of each semester. Gentlemen, what\n\t\tare the four pillars?\n\nAll throughout the pews, uniformed boys rise to their feet. TODD, who\nis not wearing a uniform, is urged by his father to stand with them.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOYS\n\t\tTradition, honor, discipline, excellence.\n\nThe boys quickly return to their seats.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n\t\tIn her first year, Welton Academy graduated five\n\t\tstudents. Last year we graduated fifty-one. And\n\t\tmore than seventy-five percent of those went on to\n\t\tthe Ivy League. This, this kind of accomplishment is\n\t\tthe result of fervent dedication to the principles taught\n\t\there. This is why you parents have been sending us\n\t\tyour sons. This is why we are the best preparatory\n\t\tschool in the United States.\n\nMr. Nolan soaks up the applause from the audience.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR NOLAN\n\t\tAs you know, our beloved Mr. Portius of the English\n\t\tdepartment retired last term. You will have the\n\t\topportunity later to meet his replacement, Mr. John\n\t\tKeating, himself a graduate of this school. And who,\n\t\tfor the past several years, has been teaching at the\n\t\thighly regarded Chester School in London.\n\nThe crowd applauds once again.\n\nEXT.

HAGER is standing in his room doorway while SPAZ and his father are\ngoing over some last minute precautions over the boy's allergies. Spaz's\nfather hands Hager various bottles.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATHER\n\t\tThis is for sinuses. Oh, and if he can't swallow you\n\t\tgive him one of these. And if he had trouble breathing\n\t\tyou can give him some of those.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAGER\n\t\tAll right fine.\n\nDr. Hager takes the bottles and quickly backs into his room, shutting\nthe door.\n\n\t\t\t\tFATHER\n\t\t\t    (to son)\n\t\tDid you remember your vaporizer?\n\n\t\t\t\tSPAZ\n\t\tYes, I put it in my room.\n\nSpaz's father tries to say something else to Dr. Hager but realizes he\nhas already gone.\n\nINT HALLWAY - DAY\n\nNeil pushes his way through a crowd of boys, carrying two suitcases. As\nhe enters his room, Knox quickly passes by.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tHey, how's it going Neil?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tHey Knox.\n\nCameron comes by and leans against the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tNeil, study group tonight?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYeah, sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tBusiness as usual, huh? Hey, I hear you got the new\n\t\tkid. Looks like a stiff!\n\nHe begins laughing when he notices Todd coming into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tOops!\n\nCameron quickly leaves. Neil tries to keep from laughing as Todd enters\nthe room and sets his luggage down on his bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tListen, don't mind Cameron. He was born with his\n\t\tfoot in his mouth. You know what I mean?\n\nHe pulls some papers from his blazer pocket and playfully whacks Todd \nacross the back with it.\n\nCHARLIE comes to the door with a smug expression on his face. Knox and\nMEEKS are close behind him. He points at Neil\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tRumor has it, you did summer school.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYep. Chemistry. My father thought I should get ahead.\n\t\tHow was your summer Slick?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tKeen.\n\nThe boys enter the room. Charlie turns around and looks at Meeks who is\njust entering. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tMeeks. Door. Closed.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tYes sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tGentlemen, what are the four pillars?\n\n\t\t\t\tBOYS\n\t\tTravesty. Horror. Decadence. Excrement.\n\nCharlie makes himself comfortable on Neil's bed and lights up a cigarette.\nMeanwhile, Todd is by his bed unpacking his luggage.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOkay, study group. Meeks aced Latin. I didn't quite\n\t\tflunk English. So, if you want, we've got our study\n\t\tgroup.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tSure. Cameron asked me too. Anyone mind\n\t\tincluding him?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHmm, what's his specialty, boot-licking?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tCome on, he's your roommate.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThat's not my fault.\n\nMeeks seems to notice Todd for the first time.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tOh, I'm sorry, my name is Steven Meeks.\n\nNeil quickly gets up from his spot by the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tOh, this is Todd Anderson.\n\nTodd turns around and shakes hands with Meeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tNice to meet you.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tNice to meet you.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tCharlie Dalton.\n\nCharlie continues to lay on the bed, looking smug. Knox extends a hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tKnox Overstreet.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tTodd's brother was Jeffrey Anderson.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOh yeah, sure. Valedictorian. National merit scholar. \n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tOh well, welcome to Hell-ton.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIt's every bit as tough as they say, unless you're a\n\t\tgenius like Meeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tHe flatters me. That's why I help him with Latin.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tAnd English, and Trig.\n\nCharlie begins coughing. There is a knock at the door. Charlie quickly\nstamps out his cigarette on the floor and Neil tries to wave the smoke\nfrom the air.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tIt's open.\n\nThe door opens and Mr. Perry walks into the room. Neil quickly rises from\nthe window.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tFather, I thought you'd gone.\n\nThe other boys stand up when he enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tBOYS\n\t\tMr. Perry.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tKeep your seats fellows, keep your seats. Neil, I've\n\t\tjust spoken to Mr. Nolan. I think that you're taking\n\t\ttoo many extra curricular activities this semester, and\n\t\tI've decided that you should drop the school annual.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tBut I'm the assistant editor this year.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tWell I'm sorry Neil.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tBut Father, I can't. It wouldn't be fair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tFellas, would you excuse us for a moment?\n\nMr. Perry walks towards the door and Neil hesitantly follows. Mr. Perry\npauses by the door and smiles to the other boys.\n\nINT. HALLWAY - DAY\n\nThe smile has gone from Mr. Perry's face. He grabs a hold of Neil's arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tDon't you ever dispute me in public. Do you\n\t\tunderstand?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tFather, I wasn't disputing-\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\nAfter you've finished medical school and you're on your own, then you\ncan do as you damn well please. But until then, you do as I tell you.\nIs that clear?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYes sir. I'm sorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tYou know how much this means to your mother,\n\t\tdon't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYes sir. You know me, always taking on too much.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR PERRY\n\t\tWell, that's my boy. Now listen, you need anything,\n\t\tyou let us know, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYes sir.\n\nMr. Perry slaps his son on the shoulder and leaves. Neil leans his head\nback against the wall as the other boys emerge from the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhy doesn't he let you do what you want?\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tYeah Neil, tell him off. It couldn't get any worse.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tOh, that's rich. Like you guys tell your parents off, Mr.\n\t\tFuture Lawyer and Mr. Future Banker.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOkay, so I don't like it any more than you do.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tWell just don't tell me how to talk to my father. You\n\t\tguys are the same way.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tAll right, all right, Jesus. So what are you going to do?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tWhat I have to do. Drop the annual.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWell I wouldn't lose much sleep over it. It's just a\n\t\tbunch of jerks trying to impress Nolan.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tI don't care. I don't give a damn about any of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tWell, uh, Latin, eight o' clock in my room?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tTodd, you're welcome to join us.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tYeah, come along pal.\n\nTodd looks up from his desk where he is setting his alarm clock.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tThanks.\n\nEXT. FIELDS - DAY\n\nA clock bell chimes five o'clock. Enormous flocks of birds, apparently\ndisturbed by the noise, take to the sky.\n\nINT. STAIRCASE - DAY\n\nThe sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they\ndescend the stairs in a long spiralling line.\n\nMR. MCALLISTER tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\tSlow down boys, slow down you horrible\n\t\tphalanx of pubescense.\n\nINT CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY\n\nA teacher walks up and down the aisles, handing out books.\n\n\t\t\t\tTEACHER\n\t\tPick three laboratory experiments from\n\t\tthe project list and report on them every\n\t\tfive weeks. The first twenty questions at\n\t\tthe end of chapter one are due tomorrow.\n\nThe students let out a collective groan.\n\nINT. LATIN CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nMr. McAllister paces back and forth in front of the blackboard and gets\nthe students to repeat everything he says.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\t\t    (students repeat after each word.)\n\t\tAgricolam. Agricola. Agricolae.\n\t\tAgricolarum. Agricolis. Agricolas.\n\t\tAgrilcolis.\n\n\t\tAgain, please.\n\t\tAgricola.\n\nINT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nDr. Hager walks up the classroom aisles with his arms behind his back.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAGER\n\t\tYour study of trigonometry requires absolute precision.\n\t\tAnyone failing to turn in any homework assignment will\n\t\tbe penalized one point off their final grade. Let me urge\n\t\tyou now not to test me on this point.\n\nINT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nStudents enter Keating's classroom, talking and acting up. Keating\nglances out from his room off to one side.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tHey Spaz, Spaz.\n\nSpaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper\nwhile Cameron smacks him on the shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tBrain damage.\n\nThe students quickly quiet down as Keating emerges from the other room,\nwhistling the 1812 Overture. He walks up the length of the classroom and\nout the door without a word. The students look around at one another,\nuncertain of what to do. Keating pokes his head back in the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tWell come on.\n\nHe gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab\ntheir books and follow Keating out into the main entranceway. \n\nINT. ENTRANCEWAY - DAY\n\nKeating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all\nthe boys arrive.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\t\"Oh Captain, My Captain\" who knows where\n\t\tthat comes from?\n\nTodd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. Spaz blows his\nnose a little too close to Meeks for his liking.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNot a clue? It's from a poem by Walt\n\t\tWhitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in\n\t\tthis class you can call me Mr. Keating. Or,\n\t\tif you're slightly more daring, Oh Captain,\n\t\tMy Captain.\n\nThe students laugh slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNow let me dispel a few rumors so they\n\t\tdon't fester into facts. Yes, I too\n\t\tattended Hell-ton and survived. And no,\n\t\tat that time I was not the mental giant\n\t\tyou see before you. I was the intellectual\n\t\tequivalent of a ninety-eight pound\n\t\tweakling. I would go to the beach and\n\t\tpeople would kick copies of Byron in my\n\t\tface.\n\nThe boys laugh once again, while Cameron, obviously trying to write all\nthis down, looks around confusedly. Keating looks down at papers in his\nhand.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNow, Mr\u0085 Pitts. That's a rather\n\t\tunfortunate name. Mr. Pitts, where are\n\t\tyou?\n\nPitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\nMr. Pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first\nstanza of the poem you find there?\n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\t\"To the virgins, to make much of time\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tYes, that's the one. Somewhat appropriate,\n\t\tisn't it.\n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\t\"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old\n\t\ttime is still a flying, and this same\n\t\tflower that smiles today, tomorrow will\n\t\tbe dying.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tThank you Mr. Pitts. \"Gather ye rosebuds\n\t\twhile ye may.\" The Latin term for that\n\t\tsentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows\n\t\twhat that means?\n\nMeeks immediately puts his hand up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tCarpe Diem. That's \"seize the day.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tVery good, Mr.-\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tMeeks.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tMeeks. Another unusual name. Seize the\n\t\tday. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.\n\t\tWhy does the writer use these lines?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tBecause he's in a hurry.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNo, ding!\n\nKeating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tThank you for playing anyway. Because we\n\t\tare food for worms lads. Because, believe\n\t\tit or not, each and every one of us in\n\t\tthis room is one day going to stop\n\t\tbreathing, turn cold, and die. \n\nKeating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs,\nand team pictures.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNow I would like you to step forward over\n\t\there and peruse some of the faces from\n\t\tthe past. You've walked past them many\n\t\ttimes. I don't think you've really looked\n\t\tat them.\n\nThe students slowly gather round the cases and Keating moves behind them.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tThey're not that different from you, are\n\t\tthey? Same haircuts. Full of hormones,\n\t\tjust like you. Invincible, just like you\n\t\tfeel. The world is their oyster. They\n\t\tbelieve they're destined for great things,\n\t\tjust like many of you. Their eyes are full\n\t\tof hope, just like you. Did they wait until\n\t\tit was too late to make from their lives\n\t\teven one iota of what they were capable?\n\t\tBecause you see gentlmen, these boys are\n\t\tnow fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen\n\t\treal close, you can hear them whisper their\n\t\tlegacy to you. Go on, lean in.\n\nThe boys lean in and Keating hovers over Cameron's shoulder.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\t\t    (whispering in a gruff voice)\n\t\tCarpe.\n\nCameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face. \n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tHear it?\n\t\t\t    (whispering again)\n\t\tCarpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys,\n\t\tmake your lives extraordinary.\n\nThe boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL STEPS - DAY\n\nThe boys emerge from the school, loaded down with numerous books.\n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\tThat was weird.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tBut different.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tSpooky if you ask me.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tThink he'll test us on that stuff?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tCome on Cameron, don't you get anything?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWhat? What?\n\nINT. LOCKER ROOM - EVENING\n\nA coach sticks his head around the corner into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tCOACH\n\t\tLet's go boys, hustle up in here. That\n\t\tmeans you Dalton.\n\nMeeks emerges from the showers, drying himself off.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tOkay, who's up for a trig study group\n\t\ttonight guys?\n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\tMe.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tMe.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(still annoyed by what the coach said)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tI can't make it guys. I have to have\n\t\tdinner at the Danburry's house.\n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\tThe Danburry's? Who are the Danburry's?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tBig alumns. How'd you swing that?\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tFriends of my Dad's. They're probably in\n\t\ttheir nineties or something.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tOoh!\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tAnything's better than Hell-ton hash.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tI'll second that.\n\n\t\t\t\tKNOX\n\t\tYeah we'll see.\n\nNeil approaches Todd, who's been sitting by the window staring down at the\nfloor.

KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY\n\nKeating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one\nof his books.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tGentlemen, open your text to page\n\t\ttwenty-one of the introduction. Mr.\n\t\tPerry, will you read the opening\n\t\tparagraph of the preface, entitled\n\t\t\"Understanding Poetry\"?\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tUnderstanding Poetry, by Dr. J. Evans\n\t\tPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand\n\t\tpoetry, we must first be fluent with\n\t\tits meter, rhyme, and figures of speech.\n\t\tThen ask two questions: One, how artfully\n\t\thas the objective of the poem been\n\t\trendered, and two, how important is that\n\t\tobjective. Question one rates the poem's\n\t\tperfection, question two rates its\n\t\timportance. And once these questions have\n\t\tbeen answered, determining a poem's\n\t\tgreatest becomes a relatively simple\n\t\tmatter.\n\nKeating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tIf the poem's score for perfection is\n\t\tplotted along the horizontal of a graph,\n\t\tand its importance is plotted on the\n\t\tvertical, then calculating the total\n\t\tarea of the poem yields the measure of\n\t\tits greatness.\n\nKeating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students\ndutifully copy it down.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tA sonnet by Byron may score high on the\n\t\tvertical, but only average on the\n\t\thorizontal. A Shakespearean sonnet, on\n\t\tthe other hand, would score high both\n\t\thorizontally and vertically, yielding a\n\t\tmassive total area, thereby revealing the\n\t\tpoem to be truly great. As you proceed\n\t\tthrough the poetry in this book, practice\n\t\tthis rating method. As your ability to\n\t\tevaluate poems in this matter grows, so\n\t\twill - so will your enjoyment and\n\t\tunderstanding of poetry.\n\nNeil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. The student sitting\nacross from him is discretely trying to eat. Keating turns away from\nthe chalkboard with a smile.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tExcrement. That's what I think of Mr. J.\n\t\tEvans Pritchard. We're not laying pipe,\n\t\twe're talking about poetry.\n\nCameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly\nscribbles it out.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tI mean, how can you describe poetry like\n\t\tAmerican Bandstand? I like Byron, I give\n\t\thim a 42, but I can't dance to it.\n\nCharlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tNow I want you to rip out that page.\n\nThe students look at Keating as if he has just gone mad.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tGo on, rip out the entire page. You heard\n\t\tme, rip it out. Rip it out!\n\nCharlie looks around at the others. He then looks down at his own notes,\nwhich consists of drawing breasts.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tGo on, rip it out.\n\nCharlie rips the page out and holds it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tThank you Mr. Dalton. Gentlemen, tell you\n\t\twhat, don't just tear out that page, tear\n\t\tout the entire introduction. I want it\n\t\tgone, history. Leave nothing of it. Rip\n\t\tit out. Rip! Begone J. Evans Pritchard,\n\t\tPh.D. Rip, shred, tear. Rip it out. I\n\t\twant to hear nothing but ripping of Mr.\n\t\tPritchard.\n\nMeeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tWe'll perforate it, put it on a roll.\n\nKeating sees Cameron still hesitating.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tIt's not the bible, you're not going to\n\t\tgo to hell for this. Go on, make a clean\n\t\ttear, I want nothing left of it.\n\nKeating goes over to his room. Cameron turns around to Neil.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWe shouldn't be doing this.\n\n\t\t\t\tNEIL\n\t\tRip, rip, rip!\n\nNeil makes Cameron turn back around.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING (O.S.)\n\t\tRip it out, rip!\n\nFrom outside the classroom, Mr. McAllister hears all the noise and sees\nall the students ripping out the pages. He bursts into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\tWhat the hell is going on here?\n\nThe boys all turn around in shock. Charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his\nmouth. Keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tI don't hear enough rips.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\tMr. Keating.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tMr. McAllister.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\tI'm sorry, I- I didn't know you were\n\t\there.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tI am.\n\n\t\t\t\tMCALLISTER\n\t\tAhh, so you are. Excuse me.\n\nMr. McAllister slowly backs out of the classroom.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tKeep ripping gentlemen. This is a battle,\n\t\ta war. And the casualties could be your\n\t\thearts and souls. \n\nKeating holds out the basket to Charlie who spits out a wad of paper.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tThank you Mr. Dalton. Armies of academics\n\t\tgoing forward, measuring poetry. No, we\n\t\twill not have that here. No more of Mr.\n\t\tJ. Evans Pritchard. Now in my class you\n\t\twill learn to think for yourselves again.\n\t\tYou will learn to savor words and language.\n\t\tNo matter what anybody tells you, words and\n\t\tideas can change the world. I see that look\n\t\tin Mr. Pitt's eye, like nineteenth century\n\t\tliterature has nothing to do with going to\n\t\tbusiness school or medical school. Right?\n\t\tMaybe. Mr. Hopkins, you may agree with him, \n\t\tthinking \"Yes, we should simply study our\n\t\tMr. Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter\n\t\tand go quietly about the business of\n\t\tachieving other ambitions.\" I have a little\n\t\tsecret for ya. Huddle up. Huddle up! \n\nThe boys get up from their seats and gather around Keating in the center\nof the class.\n\n\t\t\t\tKEATING\n\t\tWe don't read and write poetry because\n\t\tit's cute. We read and write poetry\n\t\tbecause we are members of the human race.\n\t\tAnd the human race is filled with passion.\n\t\tMedicine, law, business, engineering,\n\t\tthese are all noble pursuits, and necessary\n\t\tto sustain life. But poetry, beauty,\n\t\tromance, love, these are what we stay alive\n\t\tfor.

I don't mind that your poem had a \n\t\tsimple theme. Sometimes the most \n\t\tbeautiful poetry can be about simple \n\t\tthings, like a cat, or a flower or rain. \n\t\tYou see, poetry can come from anything \n\t\twith the stuff of revelation in it.

Now, those of you -- I see \n\t\tthe look in your eyes like, \"I would've \n\t\twalked differently.\" Well, ask \n\t\tyourselves why you were clapping. Now, \n\t\twe all have a great need for acceptance. \n\t\tBut you must trust that your beliefs are \n\t\tunique, your own, even though others may \n\t\tthink them odd or unpopular, even though \n\t\tthe herd may go, \"That's baaaaad.\" Robert \n\t\tFrost said, \"Two roads diverged in a \n\t\twood and I, I took the one less traveled \n\t\tby, and that has made all the \n\t\tdifference.\" Now, I want you to find \n\t\tyour own walk right now. Your own way of \n\t\tstriding, pacing. Any direction. \n\t\tAnything you want. Whether it's proud, \n\t\twhether it's silly, anything. Gentlemen, \n\t\tthe courtyard is yours.\n\nThe students begin walking about, some walking casually, others\nmaking up silly walks.

Neil sits down beside the\ndesk while Mr. Perry remains standing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

It's alright.\n\nCharlie grabs a handful of snow and wipes Todd's mouth with it. \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tHe wouldn't-- He wouldn't have done it. \n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tYou can't explain it, Todd. \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tIt was his father! \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tNo! \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tHe wouldn't have left us. It's because he-\n\t\tHe wouldn't have. His dad was-- his, his \n\t\tfather did it. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tTodd. \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tHis father killed him.

CLOAKROOM - DAY\n\nThe boys (except Cameron) are sitting about the cluttered room\nwaiting. Charlie lights a cigarette.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou told him about this meeting? \n\n\t\t\t\tPITTS\n\t\tTwice. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tThat's it, guys.

The \n\t\tboard of directors, the trustees and Mr. \n\t\tNolan. Do you think for one moment \n\t\tthey're gonna let this thing just blow \n\t\tover? Schools go down because of things \n\t\tlike this. They need a scapegoat.\n\nThe door opens. All the boys except Charlie hurry to put\ntheir cigarettes out and wave the smoke away. A light comes on\nand Cameron enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWhat's going on, guys? \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou finked, didn't you, Cameron?\n\nCharlie gets up and approaches Cameron, tossing his cigarette away.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tFinked? I didn't know what the hell \n\t\tyou're talking about. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou told Nolan everything about the club \n\t\tis what I'm talking about. \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tLook, in case you hadn't heard, Dalton, \n\t\tthere's something called an honor code \n\t\tat this school, all right? If a teacher \n\t\tasks you a question, you tell the truth \n\t\tor you're expelled. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYou little-\n\nCharlie lunges at Cameron but Knox and Meeks hold him back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMEEKS\n\t\tCharlie! \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tHe's a rat!

And if you \n\t\tguys are smart, you will do exactly what \n\t\tI did and cooperate. They're not after \n\t\tus. We're the victims. Us and Neil. \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tWhat's that mean? Who are they after? \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWhy, Mr. Keating, of course. The \n\t\t\"Captain\" himself. I mean, you guys \n\t\tdidn't really think he could avoid \n\t\tresponsibility, did you? \n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tMr. Keating responsible for Neil? Is \n\t\tthat what they're saying? \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWell, who else do you think, dumb ass? \n\t\tThe administration? Mr. Perry? Mr. \n\t\tKeating put us up to all this crap, \n\t\tdidn't he? If he wasn't for Mr. Keating, \n\t\tNeil would be cozied up in his room \n\t\tright now, studying his chemistry and \n\t\tdreaming of being called doctor. \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tThat is not true, Cameron. You know \n\t\tthat. He didn't put us to anything. Neil \n\t\tloved acting. \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tBelieve what you want, but I say let \n\t\tKeating fry. I mean, why ruin our lives?\n\nCharlie lunges at Cameron again and punches him in the face.\nCameron falls to the floor as the boys pull Charlie away. Cameron\nlifts a hand to his bloody nose.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tYou just signed your expulsion papers, \n\t\tNuwanda.\n\nCameron rises to his feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tAnd if the rest of you are smart, you'll \n\t\tdo exactly what I did.

NOLAN\n\t\tI have here a detailed description of \n\t\twhat occurred at your meetings. It \n\t\tdescribes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, \n\t\tencouraged you boys to organize this \n\t\tclub and to use it as a source of \n\t\tinspiration for reckless and self-\n\t\tindulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. \n\t\tKeating, both in and out of the \n\t\tclassroom, encouraged Neil Perry to \n\t\tfollow his obsession with acting when he \n\t\tknew all along it was against the \n\t\texplicit order of Neil's parents. It was \n\t\tMr. Keating's blatant abuse of his \n\t\tposition as teacher that led directly to \n\t\tNeil Perry's death. \n\nMr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of\npaper to Todd.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR.

NOLAN\n\t\tKindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tWe skipped around a lot, sir. We covered \n\t\tthe Romantics and some of the chapters \n\t\ton Post Civil War literature. \n\n\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n\t\tWhat about the Realists? \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\tI believe we skipped most of that, sir. \n\n\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n\t\tAll right, then, we'll start over.

NOLAN\n\t\tRead!\n\nAs Cameron begins to read, Keating looks out at Todd as he puts\nhis scarf on. Todd looks at him for a moment and then glances away.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\t\"Understanding Poetry by Dr. J Evans \n\t\tPritchard, Ph.D. To fully understand \n\t\tpoetry, we must first be fluent with its \n\t\tmeter, rhyme and figures of speech, then \n\t\task two questions: 1) How artfully has \n\t\tthe objective of the poem been rendered \n\t\tand 2)...\"\n\nThe door squeaks as Keating shuts it behind him. Cameron pauses. \n\n\t\t\t\tCAMERON\n\t\t\"... How important is that objective? \n\t\tQuestion 1 rates the poem's perfection; \n\t\tquestion 2 rates its importance. And \n\t\tonce these questions have been answered, \n\t\tdetermining the poem's greatness becomes \n\t\ta relatively simple matter. If the \n\t\tpoem's score for perfection is plotted \n\t\ton the horizontal of a graph--\"\n\nKeating passes by Todd and the others and gets to the back of the\nclassroom before Todd leaps up from his seat and turns to face him.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tMr. Keating! They made everybody sign \n\t\tit. \n\nMr. Nolan gets up from his desk and approaches Todd.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n\t\tQuiet, Mr. Anderson. \n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tYou gotta believe me.

NOLAN\n\t\tOne more outburst from you or anyone\n\t\telse, and you're out of this school!\n\t\tLeave, Mr. Keating.\n\nKeating hesitates at the back of the classroom.\n\n\t\t\t\tMR. NOLAN\n\t\tI said leave, Mr. Keating.\n\nKeating slowly turns and heads to the door. As he opens\nit, Todd, stands upon his desk and turns to Keating.\n\n\t\t\t\tTODD\n\t\tO Captain!
