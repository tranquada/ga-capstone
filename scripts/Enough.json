Because at this\r\n          instant the scene changes.\r\n          The man (MITCH) in the booth behind Our Hero - a man we haven't\r\n          noticed because all we've seen is the back of his head - turns\r\n          and looks at Slim.

FLY RIGHT INTO:\r\n          Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and\r\n          inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves\r\n          through the DANCERS to find:\r\n          Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move\r\n          intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are\r\n          locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly\r\n          touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter\r\n          apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...\r\n          We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely\r\n          physically involved - and how much fun they have.\r\n          Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,\r\n          confident, at ease with her power and family money, and\r\n          likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR.

We see a thought cross her mind. She\r\n          bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.\r\n          They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite\r\n          uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).\r\n\r\n<b>          FIVE YEAR OLD SON\r\n</b>          Mom!

Autodial 2.\r\n          Slim presses the autodial number, then SEND, and motions for\r\n          Tova to put on Slim's gray coat.
