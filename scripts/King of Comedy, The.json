There is a\n    very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --\n    a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have\n    stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional\n    autograph hunters are clustered together:\n\n    MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a\n    lace hat and much too much rouge.\n\n    SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,\n    slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries\n    a brown lunch bag.\n\n    CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.\n    She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.\n\n    A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges\n    from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large,\n    white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the\n    crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in\n    front of him with her autograph book raised.\n\n                       MAE\n                 (to the MAN)\n           Are you somebody?\n\n                       MAN\n           No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.\n\n    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts\n    just as PUPKIN arrives.\n\n                         MAE\n           Hi, Rupert.\n\n                       CELESTE\n                 (coolly)\n           Hello, Rupert.\n\n                       SIDNEY\n           Who did you get?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (distractedly)\n     Nobody.\n\nPUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or\ntwo away from the other professionals.\n\n                 MAE\n           (to SIDNEY)\n     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.\n\n                 CELESTE\n           (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)\n     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.\n\n                 MAE\n     Then I got him again at the\n     Pierre at four o'clock.\n\n                 SIDNEY\n     Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen\n     to have Mr. Vallone.\n\n                 MAE\n     You know what I want for him.\n\n                 SIDNEY\n     But I have only six Barbra's left.\n     You know how difficult she is to\n     work with.\n\n                 MAE\n     I don't have her even once.\n\n                 CELESTE\n           (to MAE)\n     Maybe Rupert would help you.\n\nPUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.\n\n                 SIDNEY\n     Would you do that, Rupert? You don't\n     feel about Barbra the way I do.\n\n                 MAE\n     I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.\n\n                 CELESTE\n           (needling RUPERT)\n     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do\n     that sort of thing.\n\n                 SIDNEY\n     How about it, Rupert?   I'll give\n     you whoever you want.\n\nSIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper\nbag and reading them off.\n\n                    SIDNEY\n     Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard\n     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and\n     she's    not so easy to work with\n     either    ... Louise Lasser!\n\n                 CELESTE\n     You're wasting your time.\n\nPUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other\nthree. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Look, Sidney. I'm just not\n     interested. This isn't my\n     whole life, you know.\n\n                 CELESTE\n     What's that supposed to mean --\n     that it's my whole life, or\n     Sidney's or Mae's?\n\n                 MAE\n     It is so my whole life.\n\n                 CELESTE\n     Shut up, Mae. What about your\n     mother? Isn't she part of\n     your life?\n\n                 MAE\n     It's her whole life too.\n\nThe show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.\nThe crowd around the backstage door swells.\n\n                 POLICEMAN\n           (to the crowd)\n     If you want Jerry's autograph, give\n     me your piece of paper and I'll\n     send it backstage.\n\nA number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.\nPUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college\nage. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (to the GIRL)\n     What are you going to do with\n     Jerry's autograph?\n\n                 YOUNG GIRL\n     I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.\n\n                 BOYFRIEND\n     I'll tell you what she's going to\n     do with it. She's going to pin\n\n     it on her bulletin board and\n     have an orgasm.\n\nThe YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.\n\n                             CUT TO:\n\nLANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage\ndoor. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the\ndoor of the car in conversation.\n\n                 CHAUFFEUR\n           (wearily)\n     No, Mae.\n\n                 MAE\n     I don't mean now.\n\n                 CHAUFFEUR\n     No, Mae.\n\n                 MAE\n     I'll get right out.\n\nThe CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.\n\n                             CUT TO:\n\nA plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy\nhat stands on the street side of the limousine,\ncarefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.\n\n                             CUT TO:\n\n                 MAE\n     But I've never been in one.\n\nWe hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage\ndoor. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.\n\n                             CUT TO:\n\nThe POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly\nLANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men\nin their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.\nThere is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.\nLANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes\nhis way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at\nthe rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters\nthe car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the\nblack raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the\nback seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have\nalready turned and headed back toward the theater, hear\nthe commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall\ncome to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of\nthe limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side\nof the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE\nmoves into the limo from the street side. She fights\n\nlike a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her\nout. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,\na bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.\nWhen finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles\npleasantly.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (to LANGFORD who\n           barely listens)\n     How the hell did that girl get in\n     there? Jesus, they certainly\n     don't give you very good protection,\n     do they?\n\nLANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Look at you here. Who the hell\n     is watching you? Any one of\n     these freaks could just walk\n     right up to you and do whatever\n     he wants.\n\nA couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.\n\n                 FIRST GIRL\n     Oh, Jerry. How can we get to\n     talk to you?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Just a minute. This is crazy.\n\nPUPKIN straightens up for action.\n\n                PUPKIN\n          (yelling at the crowd)\n     Okay! Stand back!\n\nPUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,\npushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.\nLANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Didn't you hear me?!?    Come on,\n     people, have a heart.\n\nThe PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the\nfar door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive\nat the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the\ncrowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Stand back!    (To LANGFORD)   Go ahead,\n     Jerry.\n\nLANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is\nholding the door, smiling pleasantly.\n\n                        LANGFORD\n           Thanks.   Thanks very much.\n\n    PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides\n    into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.\n\n2   INT:   LIMO - NIGHT\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           I hate to bother you like this, Jerry,\n           but could I speak to you for a minute.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           I'd like to but ...\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           I know you're a busy man. I promise not\n           to take very long, really. But I need\n           your advice.\n\n    PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly\n    scratched.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           You don't have a handkerchief, do you?\n           Jesus, these people will kill you for a\n           cufflink.\n\n    LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks\n    his watch.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I\n           don't mind talking as we drive. You can\n           drop me off anywhere.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.\n\n    Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his\n    CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New\n    York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance\n           to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           I'll let you know.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Really? Fine. I'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.\n           I know that the name    itself doesn't mean\n           very much to you but    it means an awful lot\n           to me, believe me.     Maybe you've seen me\n\n     outside your show and wondered who I am.\n     Well, right now, I'm in communications but,\n     by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know\n     what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another\n     one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute\n     of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced\n     of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,\n     believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably\n     wondering if I'm so good why haven't you\n     caught my act somewhere, right?\n\n                  LANGFORD\n     Well ...\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Well, up to now, I've been biding my time,\n     developing my act slowly and carefully so\n     that when my big break finally comes, I'm\n     ready -- like you were that night Paar got\n     sick and you sat in for him. I was there\n     that night, in the theater. That was the\n     most important night of my life, until\n     tonight, of course.\n\nPUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,\nflips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.\n\n                  LANGFORD\n     No thanks.   I don't smoke.\n\nPUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.\n\n                PUPKIN\n     Me neither. I just carry them as a\n     courtesy. How about a cough drop?\n\n                 LANGFORD\n           (smiling indulgently)\n     No thanks. I don't cough.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I try not to but sometimes, you know\n     ... Am I making any sense?\n\n                 LANGFORD\n           (smiling)\n     Go on.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Well, that night you did Paar, I walked\n     out of the theater like I was in a dream.\n     All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.\n     I started catching your guest appearances\n     on Sullivan and taping them and, when you\n     got your own show, it got to be a kind of\n     regular thing. I studied how you built\n     to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like\n     you were chatting, and how you delivered\n\n     the jokes without leaning too much on\n     them, without saying \"here's the punchline,\n     folks.\" And I watched the way you played\n     off dead audiences, how you let those long\n     silences build until people couldn't\n     stand it and then the way you got them\n     off the hook with that slow smile. You\n     were my college of comedy, Jerry, like\n     a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it\n     sounds crazy, but when you watch someone\n     every night ... But that's all in the\n     past. What I'm trying to say is this.\n     I'm ready now. I've finished the course.\n     And I'm thinking as we sit here talking\n     \"Is this it? Is this that one big break?\"\n     Is it, Jerry?\n\nThere is a long pause.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Jerry?\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     Look ... er ... what was the name?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm Rupert, Jerry.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying.\n     But things don't work that way. You can't\n     just walk onto a network show without any\n     experience. You've got to start at the\n     bottom ...\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     But that's where I am!\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     You've got to work your way up, learn your\n     trade in front of live audiences, start\n     playing the little clubs.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     But that can take years, Jerry! Look at\n     me. I'm already 31 years old! People my\n     age are way ahead of me. I've got some\n     catching up to do and I need your help.\n     What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking\n     you to do is listen to my act. That's all.\n     Is that asking too much?\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     I get calls from agents every day.\n     All they want ...\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry.\n\n           But you know how it is. You can't get an\n           agent unless you're working and you can't\n           get work unless you've got an agent ...\n           or unless you know somebody. And the\n           only person I know is you, Jerry.\n\n    There is a long pause.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           Look, why don't you call my office.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,\n           Jerry. You don't know how many times I've\n           had this conversation in my head. And this\n           is the way it always turns out. That's why\n           I had to sort of invite myself into the car\n           tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous\n           and I really appreciate the time you've\n           given me. But breaks like this don't just\n           happen. You have to make your own breaks.\n\n    The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before\n    U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.\n\n3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT\n\n    LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as\n    cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends\n    his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped\n    in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD\n    shakes it awkwardly.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all\n           works out for you.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay\n           you. I'm a little short on cash this\n           evening, but, if you don't mind some good,\n           hearty food, I'd be honored to take you\n           to dinner.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could\n           repay you with a joke.\n\n    LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night\n           you do your show from the coast,    you open\n           this way. \"Good evening, ladies    and\n           gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in\n\n           Southern California where you can wake up\n           in the morning and listen to the birds\n           coughing ... \"\n\n                       LANGFORD\n                 (nodding but unsmiling)\n           Not bad. Maybe.\n\n    PUPKIN calls after LANGFORD who heads for the entrance\n    to his building.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Consider it a gift. Hey, Jerry!\n           How about lunch? My treat!\n\n                       LANGFORD\n                 (turning back before\n                 he enters the building)\n           Call my office.\n\n    PUPKIN waves with his bandaged hand, notices LANGFORD's\n    handkerchief and unwraps it.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n                 (to the handkerchief)\n           Thanks, Jerry.\n\n    The CAMERA MOVES IN for a CLOSE-UP of PUPKIN in a kind of daze.\n\n                                   FADE TO:\n\n4   INT:   SARDI'S RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n    PUPKIN and LANGFORD stand at the edge of the foyer, waiting\n    for the Maitre d' to seat them. VINCENT, the owner, spots\n    them and hurries over.\n\n                       VINCENT\n           I'm sorry, Mr. Langford. (To PUPKIN,\n           angrily) How did you get in?\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           That's alright, Vincent.   Mr. Pupkin's a\n           friend of mine.\n\n                       VINCENT\n                 (puzzled)\n           Oh, I see.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           That's alright. Now if you'd be good enough\n           to find us a nice table.\n\n    PUPKIN pushes a five dollar bill into VINCENT's hand.\n\n                        VINCENT\n           Certainly.   This way, please.\n\nVINCENT leads PUPKIN and LANGFORD to the \"bullpen,\" a\nselect spot in a corner of the restaurant.\n\n                 VINCENT\n     Here you are. Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     Is Eddie here today, Vincent?\n\n                 VINCENT\n     I'll send him over.\n\nA WAITER arrives and hands them the menu.\n\n                 WAITER\n     Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua\n     a la Marinara con Spezi. Very good.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Sounds like a new opera.\n\n                  LANGFORD\n     Fine.   What comes with it?\n\n                   WAITER\n     Me.\n\nThe three laugh.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Fine.   For two.\n\n                   WAITER\n     Very good.\n\nThe WAITER leaves.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You look tired, Jerry.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     It shows, does it? It's all these problems\n     with the show. That and the custody suit.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I was sorry to read about that, Jerry.\n     Charlene never should have gotten the\n     kids. If there's anything I can do.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     I appreciate it, Rube. Just talking about\n     it a little with you helps.\n\nEddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with\ngreying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an\nopen-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He\nimmediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Hasn't Eddie already done you?\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     Never mind. You were saying ...\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Well, I've been giving a lot of thought\n     to your situation, Jerry, ever since I\n     saw you starting to lose ground in the\n     ratings. And I think I know what the\n     problem is. Too many of the same faces.\n\n                   LANGFORD\n     Yeah?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Sure, people are getting tired of these\n     people who live off game shows and talk\n     shows and can't really do anything. They've\n     seen 'em and heard 'em till they can't\n     stand it anymore.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n     You know, maybe you're right, Rube.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm sure I am. When a show runs out of\n     surprises, it loses its audience.\n\nA YOUNG GIRL stands before PUPKIN and LANGFORD.   She hands\nPUPKIN her autograph book.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     What's your name, dear?\n\n                   GIRL\n     Dolores.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (writing)\n     To Dolores, who sensed greatness.\n     Rupert Pupkin.\n\n                 GIRL\n           (reading it)\n     Thanks, Mr. Pupkin.\n\nThe GIRL leaves.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You see what I mean? What you need on the\n     show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant\n     talent making his television debut. Imagine\n     the suspense. Who is this young guy? How\n     will he do with the eyes of all America on\n     him? Something like that has got to help.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           And that's where you come in.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Why not? Believe me,     Jerry, I'd give you\n           the credit you deserve    and I'll stick with\n           you. Anytime you need     me, I'll be there,\n           doing a few minutes at    Guild scale.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           I'd be grateful, Rube.     I really would.\n\n                       EDDIE\n           All finished, Mr. Langford.\n\n    EDDIE turns the caricature so PUPKIN and LANGFORD can see\n    it. It's a picture of the two of them, facing each other\n    and smiling.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Oh, Jerry, you sneaky ...\n\n                       LANGFORD\n           Looks good, Eddie.\n\n    The WAITER arrives with a bottle of champagne.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           What's this?\n\n                       WAITER\n           Compliments of Mr. Sardi.\n\n    EDDIE hangs the picture of LANGFORD and PUPKIN on the wall\n    behind them among the hundreds of other caricatures --\n    from Bankhead to Sid Caesar to Bette Davis. The CAMERA\n    PANS over these. We hear the champagne pop.\n\n                       PUPKIN'S VOICE\n           How does your afternoon look?\n\n                       LANGFORD'S VOICE\n           What have you got in mind?\n\n                       PUPKIN'S VOICE\n           Well, we've still got time to catch\n           the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea.\n\n                       LANGFORD'S VOICE\n           Why not? But first, a toast. To you,\n           Rube and your success.\n\n                       PUPKIN'S VOICE\n           Thanks, Jerry.\n\n                                     FADE TO:\n\n5   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA - NIGHT\n\n                       PUPKIN\n           Thanks, Jerry.\n\n    PUPKIN takes LANGFORD's handkerchief and folds it\n    reverentially, tucking it carefully into his breast pocket.\n    He claps his hands together a few times for joy and\n    dashes into the street to hail a cab.\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n6   INT:   LANGFORD'S APARTMENT\n\n    LANGFORD enters his apartment. It is tasteful, modern,\n    spacious and empty. A floodlight shines on a single\n    setting at the end of a long dinner table. He walks over\n    to a large aquarium and sprinkles some food for the fish.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n                 (to the fish)\n           Say hello to Jerry.\n\n    On a shelf above the aquarium stand three pictures, one of\n    two boys, roughly eight and eleven, flanked by a shot of\n    each boy alone. LANGFORD walks to the end of the table\n    where a covered dish and a New York Post await him. He\n    lifts the covered dish which reveals a large, cold salmon.\n\n                       LANGFORD\n                 (to the fish)\n           Say hello to Jerry.\n\n    LANGFORD begins poking at the fish with his fork.    The\n    phone rings. He answers it.\n\n                         LANGFORD\n           Yeah.\n\n                       GIRL'S VOICE\n           It's Marsha, Jerry. Did you get my note?\n           I left it on the back seat. Did you get it?\n           I dropped it there before they pulled me\n           out. Those guys hurt me, Jerry. (pause)\n           Jerry?\n\n                       LANGFORD\n                 (icily)\n           Who gave you this number?\n\n                          MARSHA'S VOICE\n           Don't be    angry with me, Jerry. I didn't\n           know what    else to do; I've been trying\n           you every    five minutes, I miss you,\n           baby ...    Jerry?\n\n    LANGFORD hangs up the phone and then takes it off the receiver.\n\n                         LANGFORD\n\n            Say goodbye to Jerry.\n\n     He shakes his head wearily, returns to his dinner and turns\n     to the inside pages of the New York Post.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n7    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT\n\n     A cab pulls up in front of an all-night florist shop.\n     PUPKIN dashes out of the cab and into the florist's.\n     The cab waits.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n8    EXT:   LEXINGTON AVENUE IN THE SIXTIES - NIGHT\n\n     PUPKIN dashes out of the florist's clutching a single red\n     rose. He hops back into the cab which starts moving.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n9    EXT:   A STREET OFF BROADWAY - NIGHT\n\n     The cab pulls up in front of Gil's Steaks and Chops, a\n     restaurant of little distinction that has a few checkered\n     tableclothed tables in the rear and a long bar at the\n     front. PUPKIN stares through the window of the bar at\n     RITA, the bargirl, an attractive, somewhat shopworn blonde\n     in her late twenties. PUPKIN enters.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n10   INT:   BAR-RESTAURANT\n\n     PUPKIN goes to the near end of the sparsely-populated bar.\n\n                         PUPKIN\n            Miss!\n\n     RITA comes over.    PUPKIN smiles knowingly.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            A beer please, Miss.    Something imported.\n\n                        RITA\n            Heineken's alright?\n\n                         PUPKIN\n            Fine.\n\n     RITA serves him a Heineken's.     She stares at him, searching\n     his face.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            How have you been, Rita?\n\n     She stares again.\n\n                 RITA\n     You're not Rupert Pupkin!\n\nPUPKIN smiles broadly.\n\n                 RITA\n     How the hell did you find me?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Sally Gardner, I met her after a matinee.\n     Aren't you glad to see me?\n\n                   RITA\n     Sure, sure.    How is old Sally?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     The same, I guess. You know, two kids,\n     a nice husband, living in Clifton.\n\n                   RITA\n     It figures.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     A lot of the kids in our class have\n     moved back.\n\n                 RITA\n     What are you doing here?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I just thought I'd say hello. Here,\n     I brought you a little something.\n\n                 RITA\n           (recognizing his style)\n     Oh, yeah, Mr. Romance.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Don't forget to put in an aspirin.\n     It lasts longer.\n\nRITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.\n\n                 RITA\n     Nothing's gonna keep it alive in this place.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     How have you been, dear, sweet Rita?\n\n                 RITA\n     I don't have an aspirin.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Maybe a Rolaids would work.\n\nPUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA\nwho smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, what are you up to these days,\n     Rupert?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Didn't you know you'd see me again?\n\n                 RITA\n     You still going to the movies?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You're looking as beautiful as ever.\n\n                  RITA\n     Oh, yeah.   I was a real knockout.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I thought so.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, here I am.     Local cheerleader\n     makes good.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I voted for you for Most Beautiful.\n\n                 RITA\n     Yeah?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I didn't have the nerve to tell you then,\n     but I guess it's alright now.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, nothing terrible's gonna happen,\n     if that's what you mean.\n\nThere is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly at\nRITA.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, how are things with you, Rupert?\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Great!   Everything's starting to break.\n\n                 RITA\n     Is that right?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Yeah. As a matter of fact, that's why\n     I'm here. I've known about this place\n     for a long time. I just didn't want\n     to make my move until I had something\n     to offer you. Everything's a question\n     of timing.\n\nRITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     What's the matter?\n\nRITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.\n\n                 RITA\n     Jesus Christ, Rupert Pupkin!\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (smiling)\n     The two of us are often confused.     He's\n     the one with the famous father.\n\nPUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her\nhead. PUPKIN looks around.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (critically)\n     You like this place?\n\nRITA shrugs.\n\n                 RITA\n     Why, you got something better?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Maybe.\n\n                 RITA\n     What?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     What are you doing tonight?\n\n                 RITA\n     Tonight?\n\nRITA starts laughing.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (smiling reluctantly)\n     What's so funny?\n\n                 RITA\n           (still laughing)\n     You call me up all junior and    senior year.\n     Night after night after night,    right? And\n     every time I'm wondering 'when    is this guy\n     going to stop talking and ask    me out?'\n     Well, now I know the answer.     August\n     twelfth, nineteen seventy-six.     It only\n     took you ten, eleven years to    work up to it.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     If I had asked you out?   Would you\n     have gone?\n\n                   RITA\n     Oh, no.\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Why not?\n\nRITA starts laughing again.\n\n                 RITA\n     Because I thought you were a jerk!\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You see! I was right! But that guy isn't\n     me anymore. I look at my picture in the\n     yearbook and I don't even recognize myself.\n     I'm not the same guy, Rita.\n\nA bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves\na brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and\nthe MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.\n\n                   MAN\n     Rita!\n\n                 RITA\n           (to PUPKIN)\n     Excuse me a minute, honey.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm not honey! I'm Rupert.\n\nRITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a\nbeer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.\nFinally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.\n\n                    PUPKIN\n     Miss!     Miss!\n\nThe MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns\nto PUPKIN and serves him another beer.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.\n     Why don't we go to this nice restaurant\n     I know, talk over and times, get to\n     know each other all over again.\n\n                   RITA\n     And then?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd\n     go out again, talk some more, get to\n     know each other even better.\n\n                   RITA\n     How much?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     How much what?\n\n                 RITA\n     How much do we have to get to know\n     each other?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I don't understand.\n\n                 RITA\n           (emphatically)\n     How much do we have to get to know each\n     other before we start talking about\n     that job?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm not talking about any job.\n\n                 RITA\n     Then what's this big offer you were\n     talking about?\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     You'll see.    Right now I'm asking you\n     for a date.    How about it?\n\n                 RITA\n     I'm sorry, Rupert.     But I'm busy.\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Busy?\n\n                  RITA\n     Yeah.   Busy.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     But this is the biggest night of my life.\n\n                 RITA\n     I've already got a date.\n\nThe MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.\n\n                   MAN\n     Rita!\n\nRITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another\nbeer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with\nhim. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He\nraises his glass.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Miss!   Miss!\n\nRITA returns to him.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            Is that your date?\n\n                        RITA\n            None of your business.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            What do you want to go out with him for?\n\n                        RITA\n            He's a good friend of mine.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            Tell him you're busy.\n\n                        RITA\n            What's so important about tonight?\n\n                          PUPKIN\n            Everything!    You don't understand.\n\n                        RITA\n            No. I don't. It's been really nice\n            seeing you, Rupert. Thanks for dropping\n            in. But I've got some work to do.\n\n     RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar\n     where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN\n     sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.\n\n11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT\n\n     He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three\n     urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the\n     nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the\n     wall before them but the obvious tension between them\n     renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.\n     PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately\n     turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.\n     The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to\n     staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at\n     the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at\n     PUPKIN's penis.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT\n\n     PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by\n     the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.\n     A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN\n     and the MAN.\n\n                          PUPKIN\n            Miss!\n\n     RITA walks over reluctantly.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Listen to me for a second.\n\n                 RITA\n     I have work to do, Rupert.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Just listen. I'm at the start     of\n     something really big. I don't     want\n     to talk about it here but it's    going\n     to happen soon and it's going    to be\n     great -- for both of us.\n\n                    RITA\n     No kidding?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     So see that guy some other night.\n\n                    MAN\n     Rita!\n\nRITA turns to go.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     But I haven't finished!\n\nRITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN\nsits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,\nhe raises his glass.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Miss!   Miss!\n\nThe MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She\nopens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides\nit down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the\nmiddle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between\nPUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just\nas the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The\nbottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and\nslides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD\nMAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed\nthe THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle\ncollides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA\nglares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an\napology and RITA cleans up the mess.\n\n                 RITA\n           (to the THIRD MAN)\n     I'll get you another one.\n\nAs RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN\nwalks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and\nputs a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN\nglances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.\n\n                    MAN\n\n              (to PUPKIN)\n     Look,    friend. I'm trying to have a\n     nice    civilized conversation with the\n     young    lady. Be a good little lad,\n     huh,    and give us a break.\n\nPUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a\ngesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.\nWith an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to\nhis seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises\nhis glass.\n\n                    PUPKIN\n     Miss!     Miss!\n\nThe MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of\nbeer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the\nbottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty\nbottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of\nthe counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.\n\nPUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare\nat PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for\nanother beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few\nmoments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but\nthey keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to\ninterrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN\ncontinues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have\nsettled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a\nstone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies\nmotionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment\nwhile the handful of other patrons glance at him and return\nto their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear\nof the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she\ndoes, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert\nand prods him cruelly with his foot.\n\n                 MAN\n     C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can\n     kick your ass outta here.\n\nThe MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.\nAs he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free\nchair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN\nsmartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN\nstraightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with\ninterest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just\nlike the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN\nstood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from\nthe kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black\nCOOK.\n\n                 RITA\n           (to NICHOLS)\n     He was making trouble one minute\n     and the next he was on the floor.\n\nRITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she\n\n     thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around\n     smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and\n     the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.\n\n                        COOK\n            Okay, buddy, here we go.\n\n     NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out\n     of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a\n     mixture of curiosity and amusement.\n\n                        RITA\n            Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n13   INT:   CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT\n\n     We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,\n     shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.\n     WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the\n     kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It\n     is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,\n     with booths lining either side and a row of little tables\n     in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone\n     booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the\n     cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down\n     before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of\n     spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER\n     her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one\n     another.\n\n                        RITA\n            Another one, Chan.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n                  (to WAITER)\n            Chopsticks, please.\n\n     The WAITER nods and leaves.\n\n                        RITA\n            So all this time you've been thinking\n            about me, huh?\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            That's right, Rita.\n\n                        RITA\n            What kinds of things were you thinking?\n\n     PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.\n\n                        RITA\n            Oh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame\n            on you, Rupert.\n\n                       PUPKIN\n\n     Rita, I assure you there was ...\n\n                 RITA\n     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Come on, Rita. People will hear.\n\n                 RITA\n           (in a whisper)\n     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person. Oh,\n     come on, Rupert. Relax. Have a little fun.\n\nWAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer\nfor PUPKIN.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     This is a very important evening to me,\n     Rita.\n\n                 RITA\n     Did you know your nose wiggled when\n     you talked?\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     It does?\n\n                 RITA\n     Yeah. Just the tip. Like a rabbit.\n     (pause) Hey, are we gonna eat or\n     what? I'm starving.\n\nPUPKIN serves RITA.\n\n                 RITA\n     It always looks like they put worms\n     in this stuff.\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Just taste.\n\nRITA tastes.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, I guess it won't kill me.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     This is supposed to be the finest\n     Cantonese cuisine in the city.\n\n                 RITA\n     Yeah? Then what happened to the\n     tablecloths?\n\nPUPKIN drops his eyes.\n\n                 RITA\n     Oh, don't worry about it.   This is\n\n     fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm\n     having a good time. So you've been\n     devoted to me, huh?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I used to see you at the Garden\n     every year.\n\n                 RITA\n     Oh, the Follies. That was the right\n     name for 'em. How did you know which\n     one was me? We all looked like chickens.\n     What I mean is, we all looked like the\n     same chicken. I thought it was gonna be\n     Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I\n     wind up looking like Henny Penny.\n\nRITA chuckles to herself.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You just didn't get the breaks.\n\n                 RITA\n     Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't\n     have the money for the right coach.\n     But what difference does it make?\n\nShe starts laughing to herself.\n\n                 RITA\n     I remember once we were down in\n     Atlanta and the ice machine broke\n     down. We did three hours of slush.\n     Everyone was falling on their faces\n     and hopping up with their arms open\n     for a bow like the whole thing was\n     planned. And the people ate it up.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I liked the show.\n\n                 RITA\n     Yeah? The Follies? You really must\n     have been carrying the torch. What\n     did you think when I got married?\n     You knew I got married?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I knew it wouldn't last.\n\n                 RITA\n     You think I should have married you,\n     instead, huh?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Peter Drysdale!     Really, Rita!\n\n                 RITA\n\n     If he'd only been hit by a train.\n     He was worth a helluva lot more dead\n     than alive, I can tell you that.\n\nRITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,\ntalking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking\nyoung MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of\nbeer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA\nsmiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG\nMAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes\nover and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the\nscene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the\nYOUNG MAN.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Are you seeing anyone?\n\nRITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her\nlooking at the YOUNG MAN.\n\n                 RITA\n     What do you mean?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I want to know about the competition,\n     that's all.\n\n                 RITA\n     Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date\n     with Joe Namath -- you know Joe. And\n     Thursday --- let's see --\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm serious, Rita.\n\n                 RITA\n           (imitating him)\n     I'm serious, Rita. (In her own voice)\n     Sure I see people. I'm not a nun, Rupert.\n     I see a lot of people.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Anyone special?\n\n                 RITA\n           (chuckling)\n     You mean am I \"going steady\"?   Rupert,\n     I'm thirty-one years old!\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     What about that guy tonight?\n\n                 RITA\n     Him?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Why him?\n\n                 RITA\n     What am I supposed to do, huh? Sit\n     home watching TV? He's just some guy.\n     He's got his own aluminum siding\n     business. He comes into the city\n     sometimes, that's all.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You don't go out with him for his\n     money?!?\n\n                 RITA\n     Oh, horrors! Look, Rupert, what do\n     you think they pay me in that dump?\n     Ninety-five bucks. And you don't get\n     the world's greatest tippers in there\n     either. Somebody has to take care of\n     me.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     That's what I want to talk to you\n     about, Rita.\n\nThe WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Who's your favorite movie star?\n\n                 RITA\n     You are, Rupert.     Especially your nose.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Just tell me.\n\n                 RITA\n     Is this some kind of game? Are you\n     going to tell me something about my\n     character?\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     You'll see.    Give me his name.\n\n                 RITA\n     I can't think of anybody.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You've got to have one, Rita. Everybody\n     does.\n\n                 RITA\n     Okay. Okay. Let's see.       (pause)\n     Marilyn Monroe.\n\nPUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his\ninside jacket pocket.\n\n                   RITA\n     Oh, Rupert!    Are we going to exchange\n\n     phone numbers!?\n\nPUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,\nkeeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,\nhe turns the book to RITA.\n\n                 RITA\n     That's her name.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Her name! She signed this herself,\n     especially for me.\n\nRITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the\nother names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN\nis saying.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     She wasn't a great actress but she had\n     a real gift for comedy. She died\n     tragically, you know, alone, like so\n     many of the world's most beautiful\n     women. I'm going to see that doesn't\n     happen to you, Rita.\n\n                 RITA\n     Who's this one?\n\nPUPKIN checks the book.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Burt Reynolds.\n\n                 RITA\n     Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes.\n     Who's this?\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Mel Brooks.\n\n                   RITA\n     And this?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Carol Burnett.\n\n                   RITA\n     No kidding.    How about this?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Glenda Jackson.\n\n                 RITA\n     Never heard of her.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (pointing to other names)\n     And that's Woody Allen and there's\n\n     Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that\n     one's Lauren Bacall.\n\n                 RITA\n     You don't really know any of these\n     people?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Take a look at this.\n\nPUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to\nRITA.\n\n                 RITA\n           (squinting)\n     I can't make it out.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Try.\n\n                 RITA\n     This is really weird handwriting!\n\nExasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his\nindex finger.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Rooooper ....\n\n                 RITA\n           (guessing)\n     Redford!\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     That's Robert Redford.\n\n                  RITA\n     It is?\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     No!    It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin\n\nPUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA\njust stares at it and back at PUPKIN.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Don't lose it. It's going to be worth\n     something in a couple of weeks.\n\nRITA start laughing.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     That's what I've been trying to tell\n     you. Things are really breaking for\n     me. I'm ticketed for stardom.\n\nRITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Only a couple of hours ago, I was\n     talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry\n     Langford. Stop it, Rita!\n\nRITA pulls herself together for a moment.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     We were talking about my doing my act\n     on his show.\n\n                 RITA\n           (suppressing a smile)\n     Your act?\n\n                    PUPKIN\n     Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out\n     of    your head right now. You're looking\n     at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin,\n     the    new King of Comedy.\n\nRITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.\n\n                 RITA\n           (getting a grip on herself)\n     I'm sorry.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Why not me, Rita? A guy can always\n     get what he wants if he's willing to\n     pay the price. All it takes is a\n     little talent and sacrifice and the\n     right break. If you've got a friend\n     in the right place, that's all it\n     takes. And that's exactly what I\n     have going for me right now. After\n     all, crazier things have happened.\n\nRITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.\nAs PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the\nYOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN\nraises his eyebrows as if to ask, \"Are you interested in\nme?\" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You just don't realize what a shot on\n     the Langford Show can mean. That's\n     coast to coast, national TV, a bigger\n     audience than the greatest comedians\n     used to play to in a lifetime. A shot\n     like that means a free ticket on the\n     comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,\n     Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or\n     Carol Burnett. And you've always got\n     those other talk shows to fall back on\n     -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads\n     straight in one direction, Rita --\n     Hollywood! That's when we really start\n\n     living. How does this sound to you --\n     a beach house in Malibu, right on the\n     ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,\n     believe me. And we'd keep a suite at\n     the Sherry. That's the only place to\n     stay when you're big. We could get\n     something on a top floor and look down\n     on all our old friends in Clifton and\n     just laugh. How does that sound to you?\n\n                 RITA\n     It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I\n     really hope you get what you want.\n     But it's getting late and I'm a working\n     girl. You know what I mean?\n\nThe telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.\nA WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     You going to spend the rest of your\n     life in that place? Is that what you\n     really want, talking about nothing with\n     nothings? I thought you wanted something\n     a little better than that and that's what\n     I'm offering. Every King needs a Queen,\n     Rita. I want you to be mine. What do\n     you say?\n\n                 RITA\n     You really want to help me out? You\n     see this. (She points to her lower\n     back molar) A hundred seventy-five\n     bucks. If you could spare fifty, say,\n     until next Monday, that would keep\n     three people really happy -- me, my\n     landlord and my dentist.\n\nDuring RITA's speech, the WAITER has been working his way\nfrom the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.\n\n                 WAITER\n     Telephone for you, Miss.\n\n                 RITA\n           (looking puzzled)\n     Me?

RITA, hearing the noise, turns\n     around and finds herself staring at the YOUNG MAN.

It has nothing to\n            do with you. I had a nice dinner,\n            really.

THE STREET - NIGHT\n\n     CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN as he streaks out the door and jumps\n     into the adjacent doorway, immediately peering down the\n     street. He spies the YOUNG MAN and RITA walking about\n     three quarters of a block down and follows them, keeping\n     out of sight. They turn occasionally to see if he's\n     around, then stop turning. They go around the corner and\n     disappear into a large apartment building. PUPKIN rushes\n\n     after them,   positioning himself across from    the building.\n     He searches   the windows for some clue as to    where they\n     have gone.    Finally a set of lights go on on    the fourth\n     floor and a   MAN's shadow is seen closing two    sets of\n     blinds.\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n17   INT:   THE APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER - NIGHT\n\n     PUPKIN enters the building and finds himself in a small\n     entranceway. The door to the lobby is locked. Next to\n     the door, on the wall, are listed the tenants, their\n     apartment numbers and a button next to each name. There is\n     an intercom speaker. There are eight apartments listed on\n     the fourth floor, running from 4A to 4H. PUPKIN looks them\n     over, takes a deep breath and pushes 4A.\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n18   INT:   YOUNG MAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n     It is an extremely well-furnished studio apartment with all\n     the requirements of a contemporary bachelor pad -- an\n     imitation bearskin rug, nice bookshelves including an\n     elaborate stereo system, recessed lighting, including a\n     soft spotlight on the Queen-sized bed with its pseudo-satin\n     cover. The YOUNG MAN and RITA stand in the middle of the\n     room. RITA looks about uneasily.

CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN who walks on for a block or\n      so, then opens the envelope. It contains a set of\n      apartment keys, a scrap of hand-knitted woolen cloth and a\n      note in lipstick that reads: \"I've made you a sweater,\n      honey. Come try it on. I miss you. Love, M. 74 East\n      83rd Street, Apartment 2B!\" He takes out the money\nMARSHA\n      gave him.

WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished\nby the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made\ncollages of show business figures decorate the drab green\nwalls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly\nto a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a\nsmall cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He\npicks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into\nit.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Testing.   Testing.   Testing.\n\nIn the following montage, we hear in the background the\nreplay of his \"testing, testing testing\" and various\nother noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of\nlaughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,\na sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the\nsame time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look\nat the collages which include all the obvious show business\nfigures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin\nand Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages\nalso include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia\nChilds, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford\nIrving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special\nKennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,\nJackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a\ntrio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.\nThere is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford\nin the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,\nCarson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable\nlibrary of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,\ntreasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores\nof tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,\ni.e., \"LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72.\" \"MISC.\nMONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69.\"\n\n                              CUT TO:\n\nPUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.\nFinally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     First, Miss Long. Thanks very much\n     for your help at the office and for\n     passing this along to Jerry. I\n     appreciate it more than you know.\n\nPUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few\nbeats. He then starts the large recorder.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Now, Jerry. Before I begin, I just\n     want to thank you for listening to\n     this material and for the opportunity\n     that you've given me. You know, lots\n     of people think that guys like you,\n     you know, people who have made it,\n     lose their feeling for struggling\n\n     young talent such as myself. But\n     now I know from experience that those\n     people are just cynics, embittered\n     by their own failure. I know, Jerry,\n     that you're as human as the rest of us,\n     if not more so. (pause) Oh well, I\n     guess there's no point going on about\n     it. You know how I feel. So let's get\n     on with the show.   The best of Rupert\n     Pupkin! I've sketched out this little\n     introduction in order to save you a\n     little time. So close your eyes and\n     imagine it's exactly six o'clock.\n     You're standing in the wings and we\n     hear Rick Ross and the Orchestra strike\n     up your theme song.\n\nPUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the\ntheme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the\nvoice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.\n\n                 BERT CANTER'S VOICE\n     And now, direct from New York, it's\n     the Jerry Langford Show! Tonight,\n     with Jerry's special guest ...\n\nPUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his\nown voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder\nkeeps rolling.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     ... the comedy find of the year making\n     his television debut, Rupert Pupkin, the\n     King of Comedy!\n\nPUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes\ndown the \"play\" button. We hear a burst of thundering\napplause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and\nthen shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Now you come on, Jerry, and do your\n     monologue. Then, when the time comes,\n     this is how I see you introducing me.\n     You'll say something like this.\n     \"Ladies and Gentlemen we're going to\n     do something a little bit different\n     tonight. It isn't often that you can\n     call someone a sure thing in the\n     entertainment business. After all,\n     the verdict is always in your hands.\n     But I think after you've met my next\n     guest, that you'll agree with me that\n     he's destined for greatness. So,\n     now, will you please give your warmest\n     welcome to the newest King of Comedy,\n     Rupert Pupkin!!!\"\n\n     PUPKIN pushes the cassette and we hear another enormous\n     burst of applause. PUPKIN lets it run, listening intently.\n     He stands up and faces a wall of his room, still holding\n     the microphone. WE SEE that the wall is covered by a huge\n     blow-up of an audience laughing and applauding.\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n45   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT\n\n     WE SEE a real audience laughing and applauding.\n\n                                    CUT TO:\n\n     PUPKIN strides triumphantly onto the stage, nodding to\n     acknowledge the applause.

After a few\n     moments    the applause dies down, except for a pair of hands\n     in the    center of the orchestra.

A DOORMAN is standing by the\n     door.\n\n                          DOORMAN\n            Cab, Jerry?\n\n                        LANGFORD\n            That's alright, thanks.\n\n     WE FOLLOW LANGFORD as he walks. Some people don't notice.\n     Others stare but leave him alone, a few commenting to their\n     companions and pointing at him. A CAB DRIVER pulls\n     alongside.\n\n                        DRIVER\n            Hey, Jerry. My brother can sing\n            and juggle at the same time. How\n            about puttin' him on your show?\n\n     LANGFORD keeps walking.\n\n                        DRIVER\n            How about it, Jerry?\n\n                        LANGFORD\n            Sorry, I'm off duty.\n\n                                      CUT TO:\n\n51   EXT.

(She giggles)\n            I undress in front of you every night\n            and Larry here doesn't mind at all.\n\n                        LARRY\n            I can't get anything started with her\n            until you're off the air.

After a few beats, we\n\n                                      CUT TO:\n\n53   EXT:   BROADWAY - DAY\n\n     WE SEE MARSHA trailing LANGFORD. LANGFORD notices her and\n     starts walking quickly. MARSHA walks quickly. LANGFORD\n     starts jogging. MARSHA starts jogging. Finally, LANGFORD\n     breaks into a sprint. MARSHA runs after him. LANGFORD\n     disappears into his office building. MARSHA arrives\n     several seconds later.\n\n                           MARSHA\n            Jerry!     God damnit!\n\n     Just as MARSHA turns around, PUPKIN, unaware of her, walks\n     cheerfully into the building.\n\n                                      CUT TO:\n\n54   INT:   RECEPTION AREA OF JERRY LANGFORD SHOW OFFICES - DAY\n\n     PUPKIN enters.

Miss Long\n     will take care of you.\n\n                   PUPKIN\n     Alright.\n\nPUPKIN paces for a few beats. He smiles at the\nRECEPTIONIST. A beat later, CATHY LONG comes out,\ncarrying the tape in its box.\n\n                   CATHY LONG\n     Mr. Pupkin?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     How are you today?\n\n                 CATHY LONG\n     Fine, Mr. Pupkin. Thank you for\n     your tape. We listened to it with\n     great interest. And, frankly, Mr. Pupkin,\n     we saw a lot of good things in what\n     you're doing.

Good. I can take care of\nthat right way. Thanks. Just tell\nme the ones you think should go.\nThat would be a big help. (to the\nRECEPTIONIST) This is great. (to\nCATHY LONG) Which ones?\n\n            CATHY LONG\nWell, it's not just that, Mr. Pupkin.\nYou see, Jerry likes to panel his\nguests, you know, chat with them\nafterwards.\n\n             PUPKIN\nSure.   Sure.\n\n            CATHY LONG\nAnd frankly, we just don't feel you've\ngot very much to talk about right now.\n\n            PUPKIN\nBut I've got my whole life to talk\nabout!\n\n            CATHY LONG\nWhich is interesting to you, I'm sure\nand to your wife ... and to a few\nfriends. But we feel that you should\nkeep developing your act. Test it in\nsome live situations. There are a\nnumber of clubs in the city you can\n\n     try. And after a reasonable period,\n     get in touch with us again and we'll\n     be glad to send someone down to check\n     out your progress.\n\nPUPKIN stares at her for a few moments as the tension grows.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     May I ask you a question, Miss Long?\n\n                  CATHY LONG\n     Of course.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Are you speaking for Jerry?\n\n                 CATHY LONG\n     Let's put it this way, Mr. Pupkin.\n     Mr. Langford has complete faith in\n     our judgment.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I'm sorry to have to say this, Miss\n     Long, and I certainly don't want you\n     to take it personally, but I have to\n     tell you that I don't ... I don't\n     have faith in your judgment.\n\n                 CATHY LONG\n     Well, I'm sorry you feel that way,\n     Mr. Pupkin. But I'm afraid there's\n     nothing that can be done about that.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     No ... No ... I'm afraid I'll have\n     to disagree with you again.\n\n                 CATHY LONG\n           (with strained politeness)\n     That's your privilege, Mr. Pupkin.\n     Now, if you'll excuse me, please, I\n     have some things to do. I'm sorry\n     the news isn't better.\n\nCATHY LONG turns to go.\n\n                  PUPKIN\n     Miss Long?\n\nCATHY LONG turns back.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     When are you expecting Jerry in?\n\n                 CATHY LONG\n     He won't be in until very late this\n     afternoon.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     That's fine. Thank you.\n\nCATHY LONG stares at PUPKIN for a moment, glances at the\nRECEPTIONIST and then goes. PUPKIN takes a seat in the\nreception area. He smiles once more at the RECEPTIONIST.\nThe RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY\nLONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.\nPUPKIN continues sitting there.\n\n                 RECEPTIONIST\n     Is there anyone else you would\n     like to see?\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     That's alright. I'm happy just\n     waiting.\n\nA few beats pass in silence.\n\n                 RECEPTIONIST\n     Well, would you mind waiting outside,\n     please, Mr. Pupkin? This is a reception\n     area, not a waiting room.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I understand.\n\nPUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several\nOFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at\nPUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed\nMAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He\ngoes over to PUPKIN, who stands.\n\n                 OFFICIAL\n     Mr. Pupkin? I'm Raymond Wirtz, in\n     charge of security for the Langford\n     organization.\n\nWIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the\nfollowing dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down\nthe corridor and into the elevator.\n\n                 WIRTZ\n     Now I think you understand that we\n     have certain rules here that are\n     essential to the smooth functioning\n     of our operation.\n\n                    PUPKIN\n     Sure.     Sure.\n\n                 WIRTZ\n     And that without these rules, we really\n     wouldn't be able to function at our\n     best. You follow my point?\n\nPUPKIN nods.\n\n                        WIRTZ\n            Now one of these rules is that only\n            authorized personnel and those having\n            official business with our organization\n            are permitted on our premises. And\n            that's why I'm asking you, Mr. Pupkin,\n            to cooperate with us.\n\n     They have reached the elevator and WIRTZ has pushed the\n     button.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            You want me to leave the building.\n\n                        WIRTZ\n            That's right. It's nothing personal,\n            Mr. Pupkin. Just doing my job.\n\n     The elevator arrives. WIRTZ signals with his head that\n     PUPKIN should enter. PUPKIN gets in.\n\n                        WIRTZ\n            Have a pleasant day.\n\n                                     CUT TO:\n\n55   EXT:   STREET OUTSIDE THE LANGFORD BUILDING - DAY\n\n     PUPKIN comes out and takes up a position outside the door,\n     preparing to wait for LANGFORD.

The whole place is like a gigantic\n     maze. OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by him, taking no notice of\n     him. He continues wandering around desperately, completely\n     lost.

We circle around to the\n     back where LANGFORD, a handful of his FRIENDS (which can be\n     familiar television celebrities) and PUPKIN and RITA are\n     just finishing a lavish lunch on the patio. A pair of\n     SERVANTS are clearing the table and serving the coffee and\n     desert as the scene unfolds. As we arrive, we hear a loud\n     burst of laughter. PUPKIN is regaling the COMPANY with\n\nstories.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Oh, you have no idea how bad it's\n     gotten in New York. Now the muggers\n     are so efficient that, each time\n     they jump you, they take your name\n     and address and put you on a mailing\n     list. (the COMPANY chuckles) And\n     once you're on the list, you're in\n     real trouble, like this friend of\n     mine who was mugged thirty-two times\n     on his way home from work. (a little\n     laughter from the COMPANY)\n\nA SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in\nfront of PUPKIN and RITA.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (to SERVANT)\n     Thanks.\n\nThe SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he\nglances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her\ntart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD\nwho smiles back.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     So what my friend does is get himself\n     a dog, one of those huge German\n     Shepherds. One night, he's walking\n     the dog in Central Park when he hears\n     this voice behind him. (in a German\n     accent) Okay, Harry, drop your\n     vallet and keep your hantz over your\n     head or I bite your little fanny off.\n\nThe COMPANY breaks up.\n\n                 ONE GUEST\n           (to LANGFORD)\n     Looks like you've found yourself a\n     winner, Jerry.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n           (looking at PUPKIN)\n     He's the one who found himself\n     a winner.\n\nRITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY\nsmiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to\neating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something\nhard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The\nCOMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at\nCartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.\nLANGFORD lifts his wine glass.\n\n                 LANGFORD\n\n            To Rita and Rupert -- a short engagement\n            and a long, happy marriage.\n\n     The COMPANY drinks with murmurs of \"Hear! Hear!\"   RITA\n     and PUPKIN beam. RITA looks lovingly at PUPKIN.\n\n                        A SECOND GUEST\n                  (the PUPKIN)\n            Have you set a date?\n\n                        PUPKIN\n                  (looking pointedly at LANGFORD)\n            Oh, yes.\n\n                        A THIRD GUEST\n            I hope we're all invited.\n\n                        PUPKIN\n            Everyone's invited.\n\n                                   CUT TO:\n\n64   INT:   THE LANGFORD TELEVISION STUDIO\n\n     The theater is packed. World Series bunting hangs from the\n     balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and\n     the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down\n     one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN\n     hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches\n     PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers\n     wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-\n     haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his\n     side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and\n     stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the\n     AUDIENCE grows quiet.\n\n                        OFFICIAL\n            We are met here in these extraordinary\n            circumstances to join this man and this\n            woman in holy wedlock. But, before we\n            begin, let me voice a personal word\n            of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,\n            Rita, for choosing me to perform this\n            prestigious ceremony. Because we are\n            on prime time, I am going to discard\n            my customary remarks in favor of a\n            few personal reflections.   When I was\n            principal at Clifton High and these\n            two were students, I had very little\n            faith that Rupert here would amount\n            to very much. But like his teachers\n            and his fellow students, I underestimated\n            this fine young man.   Some say that\n            this misjudgment is directly tied to my\n            recent dismissal as head of the Clifton\n            School System. But let me take this\n            opportunity to set the record straight.\n            Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were\n\n            most certainly destined for a great\n            career and a lifetime of happiness,\n            I voluntarily stepped down. I would\n            only here add my own wishes to those\n            of millions of viewers for their\n            continued health, wealth and\n            boundless success.\n\n     The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.\n\n                        OFFICIAL\n            We'll be back to marry them in a minute,\n            right after this word.\n\n                                     FADE TO:\n\n65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAY\n\n     PUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.

My name is\n             Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,\n             New Jersey, which was not, at that\n             time, a federal offense. (laughter)\n             Is there anyone here from Clifton?\n             (silence) Good. We can all relax.\n             Now, I'd like to begin by saying that\n             my parents were too poor to afford me\n             a childhood but the fact is nobody is\n             allowed to be really poor in Clifton.\n             Once you fall below eleven thousand\n             you're exiled to Passaic. My parents\n             did, in fact, put down the first two\n             payments on my childhood. Then they\n             tried to return me to the hospital\n             as defective.   But, like everyone else\n             I grew up in large part thanks to my\n             mother. If she was only here today\n             I'd say, \"Hey, mom. What are you\n             doing here? You've been dead for\n             nine years?\" (laughter) You should\n             have seen my mother. She was wonderful\n             -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,\n             alcoholic. (laughter) We used to\n             drink milk together after school.\n             Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.\n             (laughter) Once she was picked up for\n             speeding. They clocked her doing fifty\n             -- in our garage. (laughter) When\n             they tested her they found that her\n             alcohol was two per cent blood. They\n             took away her license and she died\n             shortly afterwards. We used to joke\n             together Mom and me, until the tears\n             would stream down her face and she'd\n\n             throw up. (laughter) And who would\n             clean it up? Not Dad. He was too\n             busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on\n             his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,\n             I thought throwing up was a sign of\n             maturity. While the other kids were\n             off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I\n             was hiding behind the house with my\n             fingers down my throat. (laughter)\n             I never got anywhere until one day,\n             my father caught me. Just as he was\n             giving me a final kick in the stomach,\n             for luck, I managed to heave all\n             over his new shoes. \"That's it,\"\n             I thought. \"I've made it. I'm\n             finally a man!\" (laughter) As it\n             turned out, that was the only time my\n             father ever paid any real attention\n             to me. He was usually too busy out\n             in the park playing ball with my\n             sister, Rose. And, today thanks to\n             those many hours of practice, my\n             sister Rose has grown into a fine man.\n             (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially\n             interested in athletics. The only\n             exercise I ever got was when the\n             other kids picked on me. They used\n             to beat me up once a week, usually\n             Tuesday. After a while, the school\n             worked it into the curriculum. And,\n             if you knocked me out, you got extra\n             credit. (laughter) Except there was\n             this one kid who was afraid of me. I\n             kept telling him, \"Hit me! Hit me!\n             What's the matter with you? Don't you\n             want graduate?\" As for me, I was\n             the only kid in the history of the\n             school to graduate in traction. The\n             school nurse tucked my diploma into\n             my sling. But my only real interest,\n             right from the beginning, was show\n             business. Even as a young man, I\n             began at the very top, collecting\n             autographs.

Is it over now?\n\n      HALF-STEWED WOMAN             FIRST FRIEND\nHe's another one.       He's funnier than Larry.\n                        Larry just makes a lot\n      HALF-STEWED MAN of faces.\n(getting a little angry)\nI told you to shut up about         MOUSY MAN\nmy brother. (to PUPKIN)       Well, if nobody\nShe doesn't know nuthin'.     minds ...\n\nPUPKIN takes all this praise and excitement with a shy\nsmile of satisfaction, glancing at RITA from time to time\nfor her reaction. She merely stares at PUPKIN with a sad\nexpression on her face.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Come on, Rita. Don't spoil the party.\n     (to the CUSTOMERS) Drinks all around\n     on me.\n\n                 HALF-STEWED MAN\n           (in a loud voice, to HALF-\n           STEWED WOMAN)\n     What about the hundred and fifty?\n     We never saw a penny outta your\n     brother.\n\n                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN\n     That's because my brother is a family\n     man, not like Phil.\n\nThe argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN\ncontinues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have\nresumed their intense conversation.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (to the two FRIENDS)\n     What'll you have?\n\n                  FIRST FRIEND\n     I'm okay.   Thanks, pal.\n\n                 SECOND FRIEND\n     Me, too.\n\nThe MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the\nTV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene\n\nof violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston\nStrangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE\nto offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument\nover the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns\nto the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     I don't suppose you're allowed anything.\n     (to RITA) I guess nobody's in a\n     celebrating mood. How about you?\n     You want something?\n\n                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN\n     It's getting time, Pupkin.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     In a second.\n\n                 RITA\n           (in a sad, serious voice\n           to PUPKIN)\n     That was true, wasn't it? ... about\n     the kidnapping.\n\nPUPKIN nods and shrugs.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n     Now you can say you knew me.   That's\n     something, anyway.\n\n                 FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN\n     Come on, Pupkin.\n\n                 PUPKIN\n           (to RITA, in a quiet,\n           tender voice)\n     I guess I've got go. Take care of\n     yourself, will you. And when you're\n     bored -- you know, when you're brushing\n     your teeth or something, give me a\n     thought, okay?\n\n                 RITA\n     Okay.\n\nThe PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two\nFRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private\nconversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past\nthe HALF-STEWED COUPLE.\n\n                 HALF-STEWED WOMAN\n     It's okay to talk about my sister,\n     but we can't say nuthin' about Phil,\n     is that it?\n\n                 HALF-STEWED MAN\n           (to PUPKIN)\n     She's just had one too many.\n\n      The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN onto the street.\n\n148   EXT:   THE BAR - NIGHT\n\n      As they walk the few steps to the car, the FIRST\n      PLAINCLOTHESMAN turns to PUPKIN.\n\n                         FIRST    PLAINCLOTHESMAN\n             I just don't get    it, Pupkin. You're\n             gonna spend eight    years in the can --\n             \"minimum\" -- and    for what?\n\n                         SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN\n             Yeah, Pupkin. You threw it all away.\n\n                         PUPKIN\n                   (vaguely)\n             We'll see.\n\n      WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN, smiling.\n\n                                       FADE TO:\n\n149   INT:   THE JERRY LANGFORD SHOW STUDIO - NIGHT\n\n      The STAGE MANAGER is counting down. At zero, he points to\n      RICK ROSS who launches the orchestra into the Langford Show\n      theme song. BERT CANTER, standing stage right, speaks into\n      the mike.\n\n                         CANTER\n             And now!

By the end of the MONTAGE,\n      LANGFORD is once again mummified and PUPKIN, having\n      finished, bows and smiles. WE CLOSE on a FREEZE-FRAME\n      CLOSE UP of PUPKIN in ecstasy.\n\n                                       FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\nDecember 15, 1976 draft\nScreenplay by Paul D.
