There is a\n    very small crowd already positioned at the stage door --\n    a few young girls, a few curious passers-by who have\n    stopped to see who will emerge. Three professional\n    autograph hunters are clustered together:\n\n    MAE, a lady in her sixties, wears a red velvet dress, a\n    lace hat and much too much rouge.\n\n    SIDNEY is in his mid-twenties, tall, badly-complexioned,\n    slicked hair but otherwise neatly dressed. He carries\n    a brown lunch bag.\n\n    CELESTE is an enormously fat woman in her mid-thirties.\n    She wears a large cape to conceal her obesity.\n\n    A middle-aged MAN, dressed in a corduroy suit,    emerges\n    from the backstage door which is guarded by a    large,\n    white-haired POLICEMAN. The non-professionals     in the\n    crowd just peer at the MAN but MAE immediately    steps in\n    front of him with her autograph book raised.\n\n<b>                       MAE\n</b>                 (to the MAN)\n           Are you somebody?\n\n<b>                       MAN\n</b>           No, honey, I'm just a working stiff.\n\n    The MAN keep walking and MAE returns to her cohorts\n    just as PUPKIN arrives.\n\n<b>                         MAE\n</b>           Hi, Rupert.\n\n<b>                       CELESTE\n</b>                 (coolly)\n           Hello, Rupert.\n\n<b>                       SIDNEY\n</b>           Who did you get?\n<b>\n</b><b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>           (distractedly)\n     Nobody.\n\nPUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or\ntwo away from the other professionals.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>           (to SIDNEY)\n     I got Mr. Raf Vallone outside 21.\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>           (to SIDNEY about PUPKIN)\n     He'd never tell you anyway, Sidney.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     Then I got him again at the\n     Pierre at four o'clock.\n\n<b>                 SIDNEY\n</b>     Be a dear, Mae. I don't happen\n     to have Mr. Vallone.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     You know what I want for him.\n\n<b>                 SIDNEY\n</b>     But I have only six Barbra's left.\n     You know how difficult she is to\n     work with.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     I don't have her even once.\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>           (to MAE)\n     Maybe Rupert would help you.\n\nPUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.\n\n<b>                 SIDNEY\n</b>     Would you do that, Rupert? You don't\n     feel about Barbra the way I do.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     I'll give you Mr. Burt Reynolds too.\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>           (needling RUPERT)\n     Look, Sidney, Rupert doesn't do\n     that sort of thing.\n\n<b>                 SIDNEY\n</b>     How about it, Rupert?   I'll give\n     you whoever you want.\n\nSIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper\nbag and reading them off.\n<b>\n</b><b>                    SIDNEY\n</b>     Rodney    Dangerfield ... Richard\n     Harris    ... Liza Minelli ... and\n     she's    not so easy to work with\n     either    ... Louise Lasser!\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>     You're wasting your time.\n\nPUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other\nthree. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Look, Sidney. I'm just not\n     interested. This isn't my\n     whole life, you know.\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>     What's that supposed to mean --\n     that it's <u>my</u> whole life, or\n     Sidney's or Mae's?\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     It <u>is</u> so my whole life.\n\n<b>                 CELESTE\n</b>     Shut up, Mae. What about your\n     mother? Isn't she part of\n     your life?\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     It's her whole life too.\n\nThe show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.\nThe crowd around the backstage door swells.\n\n<b>                 POLICEMAN\n</b>           (to the crowd)\n     If you want Jerry's autograph, give\n     me your piece of paper and I'll\n     send it backstage.\n\nA number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.\nPUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college\nage. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>           (to the GIRL)\n     What are you going to do with\n     Jerry's autograph?\n\n<b>                 YOUNG GIRL\n</b>     I don't know. Maybe I'll sell it.\n\n<b>                 BOYFRIEND\n</b>     I'll tell you what she's going to\n     do with it. She's going to pin\n<b>\n</b>     it on her bulletin board and\n     have an orgasm.\n\nThe YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.\n\n<b>                             CUT TO:\n</b>\nLANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage\ndoor. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the\ndoor of the car in conversation.\n\n<b>                 CHAUFFEUR\n</b>           (wearily)\n     No, Mae.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     I don't mean now.\n\n<b>                 CHAUFFEUR\n</b>     No, Mae.\n\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     I'll get right out.\n\nThe CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.\n\n<b>                             CUT TO:\n</b>\nA plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy\nhat stands on the street side of the limousine,\ncarefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.\n\n<b>                             CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>                 MAE\n</b>     But I've never been in one.\n\nWe hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage\ndoor. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.\n\n<b>                             CUT TO:\n</b>\nThe POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly\nLANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men\nin their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.\nThere is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.\nLANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes\nhis way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at\nthe rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters\nthe car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the\nblack raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the\nback seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have\nalready turned and headed back toward the theater, hear\nthe commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall\ncome to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of\nthe limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side\nof the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE\nmoves into the limo from the street side. She fights\n<b>\n</b>like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her\nout. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,\na bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.\nWhen finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles\npleasantly.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>           (to LANGFORD who\n           barely listens)\n     How the hell did that girl get in\n     there? Jesus, they certainly\n     don't give you very good protection,\n     do they?\n\nLANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Look at you here. Who the hell\n     is watching you? Any one of\n     these freaks could just walk\n     right up to you and do whatever\n     he wants.\n\nA couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.\n\n<b>                 FIRST GIRL\n</b>     Oh, Jerry. How can we get to\n     talk to you?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Just a minute. This is crazy.\n\nPUPKIN straightens up for action.\n\n<b>                PUPKIN\n</b>          (yelling at the crowd)\n     Okay! Stand back!\n\nPUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,\npushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.\nLANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Didn't you hear me?!?    Come on,\n     people, have a heart.\n\nThe PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the\nfar door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive\nat the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the\ncrowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.\n\n<b>                   PUPKIN\n</b>     Stand back!    (To LANGFORD)   Go ahead,\n     Jerry.\n\nLANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is\nholding the door, smiling pleasantly.\n<b>\n</b><b>                        LANGFORD\n</b>           Thanks.   Thanks very much.\n\n    PUPKIN stares at LANGFORD for a moment and then slides\n    into the limo next to him, closing the door behind him.\n\n<b>2   INT:   LIMO - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           I hate to bother you like this, Jerry,\n           but could I speak to you for a minute.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           I'd like to but ...\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           I know you're a busy man. I promise not\n           to take very long, really. But I need\n           your advice.\n\n    PUPKIN looks down at his hand which has been badly\n    scratched.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           You don't have a handkerchief, do you?\n           Jesus, these people will kill you for a\n           cufflink.\n\n    LANGFORD hands him a monogrammed handkerchief, then checks\n    his watch.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Thanks. If you have to be somewhere, I\n           don't mind talking as we drive. You can\n           drop me off anywhere.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           Sorry, but I've got a strict rule never to ...\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           I put myself on the line for you, Jerry.\n\n    Reluctantly, LANGFORD signals with his head to his\n    CHAUFFEUR to start moving. As the car moves through New\n    York traffic, PUPKIN and LANGFORD talk.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Thanks, Jerry. I'm grateful for this chance\n           to talk to you ... I hope I'm not boring you.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           I'll let you know.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Really? Fine. I'm      Rupert Pupkin, Jerry.\n           I know that the name    itself doesn't mean\n           very much to you but    it means an awful lot\n           to me, believe me.     Maybe you've seen me\n<b>\n</b>     outside your show and wondered who I am.\n     Well, right now, I'm in communications but,\n     by nature, I'm a stand-up comedian. I know\n     what you're thinking -- 'oh no. Not another\n     one.' And I wouldn't take up even one minute\n     of your time if I wasn't absolutely convinced\n     of my talent. I'm really good, Jerry,\n     believe me, I'm dynamite. Now you're probably\n     wondering if I'm so good why haven't you\n     caught my act somewhere, right?\n\n<b>                  LANGFORD\n</b>     Well ...\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Well, up to now, I've been biding my time,\n     developing my act slowly and carefully so\n     that when my big break finally comes, I'm\n     ready -- like you were that night Paar got\n     sick and you sat in for him. I was there\n     that night, in the theater. That was the\n     most important night of my life, until\n     tonight, of course.\n\nPUPKIN fishes a cigarette case out of his jacket pocket,\nflips it open and offers one to LANGFORD.\n\n<b>                  LANGFORD\n</b>     No thanks.   I don't smoke.\n\nPUPKIN returns the pack to his pocket.\n\n<b>                PUPKIN\n</b>     Me neither. I just carry them as a\n     courtesy. How about a cough drop?\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>           (smiling indulgently)\n     No thanks. I don't cough.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I try not to but sometimes, you know\n     ... Am I making any sense?\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>           (smiling)\n     Go on.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Well, that night you did Paar, I walked\n     out of the theater like I was in a dream.\n     All of a sudden, I knew what I wanted.\n     I started catching your guest appearances\n     on Sullivan and taping them and, when you\n     got your own show, it got to be a kind of\n     regular thing. I studied how you built\n     to your one-liners, nice and relaxed like\n     you were chatting, and how you delivered\n<b>\n</b>     the jokes without leaning too much on\n     them, without saying \"here's the punchline,\n     folks.\" And I watched the way you played\n     off dead audiences, how you let those long\n     silences build until people couldn't\n     stand it and then the way you got them\n     off the hook with that slow smile. You\n     were my college of comedy, Jerry, like\n     a kind of teacher, a friend. I know it\n     sounds crazy, but when you watch someone\n     every night ... But that's all in the\n     past. What I'm trying to say is this.\n     I'm ready now. I've finished the course.\n     And I'm thinking as we sit here talking\n     \"Is this it? Is this that one big break?\"\n     Is it, Jerry?\n\nThere is a long pause.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Jerry?\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>     Look ... er ... what was the name?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I'm Rupert, Jerry.\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>     Look, Rupert. I know what you're saying.\n     But things don't work that way. You can't\n     just walk onto a network show without any\n     experience. You've got to start at the\n     bottom ...\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     But that's where I am!\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>     You've got to work your way up, learn your\n     trade in front of live audiences, start\n     playing the little clubs.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     But that can take years, Jerry! Look at\n     me. I'm already 31 years old! People my\n     age are way ahead of me. I've got some\n     catching up to do and I need your help.\n     What do you say, Jerry? All I'm asking\n     you to do is listen to my act. That's all.\n     Is that asking too much?\n\n<b>                 LANGFORD\n</b>     I get calls from agents every day.\n     All they want ...\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I tried getting an agent.   I did, Jerry.\n<b>\n</b>           But you know how it is. You can't get an\n           agent unless you're working and you can't\n           get work unless you've got an agent ...\n           or unless you know somebody. And the\n           only person I know is you, Jerry.\n\n    There is a long pause.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           Look, why don't you call my office.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Could I?!? Oh, I knew you'd say that,\n           Jerry. You don't know how many times I've\n           had this conversation in my head. And this\n           is the way it always turns out. That's why\n           I had to sort of invite myself into the car\n           tonight. I know it's kind of presumptuous\n           and I really appreciate the time you've\n           given me. But breaks like this don't just\n           happen. You have to make your own breaks.\n\n    The limousine starts slowing down as it pulls up before\n    U.N. Plaza. It stops. LANGFORD gets out. PUPKIN follows.\n\n<b>3   EXT:   U.N. PLAZA APARTMENTS - NIGHT\n</b>\n    LANGFORD turn to PUPKIN,    looking to get rid of him as\n    cleanly and gracefully as    possible. LANGFORD extends\n    his hand. PUPKIN goes to     shake it but his hand is wrapped\n    in the handkerchief. He     extends his left hand. LANGFORD\n    shakes it awkwardly.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           Nice meeting you, Rupert.   I hope it all\n           works out for you.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Thanks, Jerry. I don't know how to repay\n           you. I'm a little short on cash this\n           evening, but, if you don't mind some good,\n           hearty food, I'd be honored to take you\n           to dinner.\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           Thanks, but some people are waiting for me.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Oh, I understand. Well, then, maybe I could\n           repay you with a joke.\n\n    LANGFORD is starting to walk into the building.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Wait a minute. How's this? The      first night\n           you do your show from the coast,    you open\n           this way. \"Good evening, ladies    and\n           gentlemen, it's great to be back    here in\n<b>\n</b>           Southern California where you can wake up\n           in the morning and listen to the birds\n           coughing ... \"\n\n<b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>                 (nodding but unsmiling)\n           Not bad.

He     is a small, slightly-bald man with\ngreying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an\nopen-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad.

What you need on the\n     show is some unknown quantity, some brilliant\n     talent making his television debut. Imagine\n     the suspense. Who is this young guy? How\n     will he do with the eyes of all America on\n     him? Something like that has got to help.\n<b>\n</b><b>                       LANGFORD\n</b>           And that's where you come in.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b>           Why not?

RITA returns\nto PUPKIN and serves him another beer.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I'm in the mood to celebrate tonight.\n     Why don't we go to this nice restaurant\n     I know, talk over and times, get to\n     know each other all over again.\n\n<b>                   RITA\n</b>     And then?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Well, tomorrow night I thought we'd\n     go out again, talk some more, get to\n     know each other even better.\n\n<b>                   RITA\n</b>     How much?\n<b>\n</b><b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     How much what?\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     How much do we have to get to know\n     each other?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I don't understand.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>           (emphatically)\n     How much do we have to get to know each\n     other before we start talking about\n     that job?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I'm not talking about any job.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Then what's this big offer you were\n     talking about?\n\n<b>                   PUPKIN\n</b>     You'll see.

She pours him another\nbeer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with\nhim. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He\nraises his glass.\n\n<b>                  PUPKIN\n</b>     Miss!

But I've got some work to do.\n\n     RITA leaves PUPKIN and returns to the far end of the bar\n     where she once again resumes talking with the MAN. PUPKIN\n     sits for a moment, gets up slowly and heads for the john.\n\n<b>11   INT:   THE JOHN - NIGHT\n</b>\n     He enters the john and goes to the farthest of the three\n     urinals. A moment later, the MAN enters. He goes to the\n     nearest of the three urinals. The two men stare at the\n     wall before them but the obvious tension between them\n     renders them both incapable of relieving themselves.\n     PUPKIN glances over at the MAN's face, then immediately\n     turns back to the wall as the MAN turns to look at him.\n     The MAN glances quickly at PUPKIN and then returns to\n     staring at the wall. PUPKIN sneaks a furtive glance at\n     the MAN's penis. The MAN sneaks a furtive glance at\n     PUPKIN's penis.\n\n<b>                                     CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>12   INT:   THE BAR - NIGHT\n</b>\n     PUPKIN emerges from the john, followed a moment later by\n     the MAN. They resume their seats at each end of the bar.\n     A third MAN has come in and is seated midway between PUPKIN\n     and the MAN.\n\n<b>                          PUPKIN\n</b>            Miss!\n\n     RITA walks over reluctantly.\n<b>\n</b><b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Listen to me for a second.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     I have work to do, Rupert.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Just listen.

I don't     want\n     to talk about it here but it's    going\n     to happen soon and it's going    to be\n     great -- for both of us.\n\n<b>                    RITA\n</b>     No kidding?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     So see that guy some other night.\n\n<b>                    MAN\n</b>     Rita!\n\nRITA turns to go.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     But I haven't finished!\n\nRITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN\nsits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,\nhe raises his glass.\n\n<b>                  PUPKIN\n</b>     Miss!   Miss!\n\nThe MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She\nopens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides\nit down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the\nmiddle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between\nPUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just\nas the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The\nbottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and\nslides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD\nMAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed\nthe THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle\ncollides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA\nglares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an\napology and RITA cleans up the mess.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>           (to the THIRD MAN)\n     I'll get you another one.\n\nAs RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN\nwalks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and\nputs a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN\nglances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.\n\n<b>                    MAN\n</b><b>\n</b>              (to PUPKIN)\n     Look,    friend. I'm trying to have a\n     nice    civilized conversation with the\n     young    lady. Be a good little lad,\n     huh,    and give us a break.\n\nPUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a\ngesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.\nWith an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to\nhis seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises\nhis glass.\n\n<b>                    PUPKIN\n</b>     Miss!     Miss!\n\nThe MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of\nbeer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the\nbottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty\nbottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of\nthe counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.\n\nPUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare\nat PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for\nanother beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few\nmoments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but\nthey keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to\ninterrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN\ncontinues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have\nsettled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a\nstone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies\nmotionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment\nwhile the handful of other patrons glance at him and return\nto their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear\nof the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she\ndoes, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert\nand prods him cruelly with his foot.\n\n<b>                 MAN\n</b>     C'mon, schmuck, wake up so I can\n     kick your ass outta here.\n\nThe MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.\nAs he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free\nchair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN\nsmartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN\nstraightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with\ninterest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just\nlike the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN\nstood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from\nthe kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black\n<b>COOK.\n</b>\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>           (to NICHOLS)\n     He was making trouble one minute\n     and the next he was on the floor.\n\nRITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she\n<b>\n</b>     thinks is the MAN's arm. Instead, PUPKIN turns around\n     smiling, leaving her too startled to speak. NICHOLS and\n     the COOK lift the MAN to his feet.\n\n<b>                        COOK\n</b>            Okay, buddy, here we go.\n\n     NICHOLS and the COOK lead the MAN, who is still groggy, out\n     of the bar as RITA continues to stare at PUPKIN with a\n     mixture of curiosity and amusement.\n\n<b>                        RITA\n</b>            Okay, Tarzan. Where do we eat tonight?\n\n<b>                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>13   INT:   CHINESE RESTAURANT ON UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT\n</b>\n     We are in the kitchen watching two dishes being chopped,\n     shredded and boiled in deep fat. The activity is frantic.\n     WE FOLLOW the two dishes as a WAITER carries them from the\n     kitchen to a booth where PUPKIN and RITA are talking. It\n     is a painfully plain restaurant, shaped in a rectangle,\n     with booths lining either side and a row of little tables\n     in between. At the back is the kitchen and two phone\n     booths, facing each other. An old Chinese WOMAN mans the\n     cash register by the door. The WAITER sets the dishes down\n     before RITA and PUPKIN and clears an enormous plate of\n     spare rib bones from RITA's place. RITA hands the WAITER\n     her empty cocktail glass. RITA and PUPKIN are facing one\n     another.\n\n<b>                        RITA\n</b>            Another one, Chan.\n\n<b>                        PUPKIN\n</b>                  (to WAITER)\n            Chopsticks, please.\n\n     The WAITER nods and leaves.\n\n<b>                        RITA\n</b>            So all this time you've been thinking\n            about me, huh?\n\n<b>                        PUPKIN\n</b>            That's right, Rita.\n\n<b>                        RITA\n</b>            What kinds of things were you thinking?\n\n     PUPKIN drops his eyes shyly.      RITA starts laughing.\n\n<b>                        RITA\n</b>            Oh, ho! Those kinds of things!    Shame\n            on you, Rupert.\n\n<b>                       PUPKIN\n</b><b>\n</b>     Rita, I assure you there was ...\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person!\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Come on, Rita.

Have a little fun.\n\nWAITER arrives with RITA's drink and chopsticks and a beer\nfor PUPKIN.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     This is a very important evening to me,\n     Rita.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Did you know your nose wiggled when\n     you talked?\n\n<b>                   PUPKIN\n</b>     It does?\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Yeah.

I'm starving.\n\nPUPKIN serves RITA.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     It always looks like they put worms\n     in this stuff.\n\n<b>                   PUPKIN\n</b>     Just taste.\n\nRITA tastes.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Well, I guess it won't kill me.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     This is supposed to be the finest\n     Cantonese cuisine in the city.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Yeah? Then what happened to the\n     tablecloths?\n\nPUPKIN drops his eyes.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Oh, don't worry about it.   This is\n<b>\n</b>     fine. (She takes a long drink) I'm\n     having a good time. So you've been\n     devoted to me, huh?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I used to see you at the Garden\n     every year.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Oh, the Follies. That was the right\n     name for 'em. How did you know which\n     one was me? We all looked like chickens.\n     What I mean is, we all looked like the\n     <u>same</u> chicken. I thought it was gonna be\n     Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I\n     wind up looking like Henny Penny.\n\nRITA chuckles to herself.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     You just didn't get the breaks.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Breaks, bullshit! My parents didn't\n     have the money for the right coach.\n     But what difference does it make?\n\nShe starts laughing to herself.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     I remember once we were down in\n     Atlanta and the ice machine broke\n     down. We did three hours of slush.\n     Everyone was falling on their faces\n     and hopping up with their arms open\n     for a bow like the whole thing was\n     planned. And the people ate it up.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I liked the show.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Yeah? The Follies? You really must\n     have been carrying the torch. What\n     did you think when I got married?\n     You knew I got married?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I knew it wouldn't last.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     You think I should have married you,\n     instead, huh?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Peter <u>Drysdale</u>!     Really, Rita!\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b><b>\n</b>     If he'd only been hit by a train.\n     He was worth a helluva lot more dead\n     than alive, I can tell you that.\n\nRITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,\ntalking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking\nyoung MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of\nbeer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA\nsmiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG\nMAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes\nover and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the\nscene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the\n<b>YOUNG MAN.\n</b>\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Are you seeing anyone?\n\nRITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her\nlooking at the YOUNG MAN.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     What do you mean?\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     I want to know about the competition,\n     that's all.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     Well, tomorrow night, I've got a date\n     with Joe Namath -- you know Joe.

Are we going to exchange\n<b>\n</b>     phone numbers!?\n\nPUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,\nkeeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,\nhe turns the book to RITA.\n\n<b>                 RITA\n</b>     That's her name.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     Her name! She signed this herself,\n     especially for me.\n\nRITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the\nother names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN\nis saying.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     She wasn't a great actress but she had\n     a real gift for comedy.

A shot\n     like that means a free ticket on the\n     comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week,\n     Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or\n     Carol Burnett. And you've always got\n     those other talk shows to fall back on\n     -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads\n     straight in one direction, Rita --\n     Hollywood! That's when we really start\n<b>\n</b>     <u>living</u>. How does this sound to you --\n     a beach house in Malibu, right on the\n     ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan,\n     believe me.

At the\nsame time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look\nat the collages which include all the obvious show business\nfigures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin\nand Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages\nalso include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia\nChilds, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford\nIrving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special\nKennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,\nJackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a\ntrio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.\nThere is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford\nin the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,\nCarson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable\nlibrary of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,\ntreasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores\nof tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,\ni.e., \"LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72.\" \"MISC.\nMONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69.\"\n\n<b>                              CUT TO:\n</b>\nPUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.\nFinally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.\n\n<b>                 PUPKIN\n</b>     First, Miss Long.

World Series bunting hangs from the\n     balcony and the front of the stage. We hear RICK ROSS and\n     the ORCHESTRA strike up Mendelssohn's Wedding March.   Down\n     one aisle walks RITA, accompanied by the MAN whom PUPKIN\n     hit over the head at the bar. Down the other aisle marches\n     PUPKIN, accompanied by LANGFORD. The AUDIENCE cheers\n     wildly. The two COUPLES walk to the stage where a white-\n     haired OFFICIAL awaits them. BERT CANTER stands at his\n     side. PUPKIN and RITA disengage from their ESCORTS and\n     stand before the OFFICIAL. The music stops and the\n     AUDIENCE grows quiet.\n\n<b>                        OFFICIAL\n</b>            We are met here in these extraordinary\n            circumstances to join this man and this\n            woman in holy wedlock. But, before we\n            begin, let me voice a personal word\n            of thanks to you, Rupert and to you,\n            Rita, for choosing me to perform this\n            prestigious ceremony. Because we are\n            on prime time, I am going to discard\n            my customary remarks in favor of a\n            few personal reflections.   When I was\n            principal at Clifton High and these\n            two were students, I had very little\n            faith that Rupert here would amount\n            to very much. But like his teachers\n            and his fellow students, I underestimated\n            this fine young man.   Some say that\n            this misjudgment is directly tied to my\n            recent dismissal as head of the Clifton\n            School System. But let me take this\n            opportunity to set the record straight.\n            Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were\n<b>\n</b>            most certainly destined for a great\n            career and a lifetime of happiness,\n            I voluntarily stepped down. I would\n            only here add my own wishes to those\n            of millions of viewers for their\n            continued health, wealth and\n            boundless success.\n\n     The OFFICIAL looks quickly past RITA and PUPKIN.\n\n<b>                        OFFICIAL\n</b>            We'll be back to marry them in a minute,\n            right after this word.\n\n<b>                                     FADE TO:\n</b>\n<b>65   INT:   THE TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\n     PUPKIN and RITA are seated as they were.

My name is\n             Rupert Pupkin. I was born in Clifton,\n             New Jersey, which was not, at that\n             time, a federal offense. (laughter)\n             Is there anyone here from Clifton?\n             (silence) Good. We can all relax.\n             Now, I'd like to begin by saying that\n             my parents were too poor to afford me\n             a childhood but the fact is nobody is\n             allowed to be really poor in Clifton.\n             Once you fall below eleven thousand\n             you're exiled to Passaic. My parents\n             did, in fact, put down the first two\n             payments on my childhood. Then they\n             tried to return me to the hospital\n             as defective.   But, like everyone else\n             I grew up in large part thanks to my\n             mother. If she was only here today\n             I'd say, \"Hey, mom. What are you\n             doing here? You've been dead for\n             nine years?\" (laughter) You should\n             have seen my mother. She was wonderful\n             -- blonde, beautiful, intelligent,\n             alcoholic. (laughter) We used to\n             drink milk together after school.\n             Mine was homogenized. Hers was loaded.\n             (laughter) Once she was picked up for\n             speeding. They clocked her doing fifty\n             -- in our garage. (laughter) When\n             they tested her they found that her\n             alcohol was two per cent blood. They\n             took away her license and she died\n             shortly afterwards. We used to joke\n             together Mom and me, until the tears\n             would stream down her face and she'd\n<b>\n</b>             throw up. (laughter) And who would\n             clean it up? Not Dad. He was too\n             busy down at O'Grady's throwing up on\n             his own. In fact, until I was sixteen,\n             I thought throwing up was a sign of\n             maturity. While the other kids were\n             off in the woods sneaking cigarettes, I\n             was hiding behind the house with my\n             fingers down my throat. (laughter)\n             I never got anywhere until one day,\n             my father caught me. Just as he was\n             giving me a final kick in the stomach,\n             for luck, I managed to heave all\n             over his new shoes. \"That's it,\"\n             I thought. \"I've made it. I'm\n             finally a man!\" (laughter) As it\n             turned out, that was the only time my\n             father ever paid any real attention\n             to me. He was usually too busy out\n             in the park playing ball with my\n             sister, Rose. And, today thanks to\n             those many hours of practice, my\n             sister Rose has grown into a fine man.\n             (laughter) Me, I wasn't especially\n             interested in athletics. The only\n             exercise I ever got was when the\n             other kids picked on me. They used\n             to beat me up once a week, usually\n             Tuesday. After a while, the school\n             worked it into the curriculum. And,\n             if you knocked me out, you got extra\n             credit. (laughter) Except there was\n             this one kid who was afraid of me. I\n             kept telling him, \"Hit me! Hit me!\n             What's the matter with you? Don't you\n             want graduate?\" As for me, I was\n             the only kid in the history of the\n             school to graduate in traction. The\n             school nurse tucked my diploma into\n             my sling. But my only real interest,\n             right from the beginning, was show\n             business. Even as a young man, I\n             began at the very top, collecting\n             autographs.

A\n      working class COUPLE in their late fifties are half-stewed,\n      the man telling the woman that her friend, Maud, isn't\n      really her friend because she wants $150 for a used\n      refrigerator. A few seats down, two MEN in their mid-\n      forties, in wind-breakers are locked in an intense but\n      inaudible conversation. And, close to the television set\n      which hangs over the far end of the bar sits a MOUSY MAN\n      with glasses, who looks like an accountant. He is sipping\n      a beer, his eyes fixed on the set where the CBS late movie\n      is just showing its logo.

Perched atop the bar,\n      standing next to the image of himself,     PUPKIN looks down at\n      RITA, a smile of pride and triumph on     his face.\n\n<b>                                      CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>145   MONTAGE -- NIGHT\n</b>\n      PUPKIN walking onto television screens in various homes\n      across America -- in a chic New York living room, in a\n      suburban bedroom, in the parlor of an Indiana farmhouse,\n      in a kitchen where a COUPLE is in the middle of a raging\n      domestic quarrel, in an otherwise dark bedroom where a\n      COUPLE is in the throes of lovemaking, in a bar, a station\n      house, in a television store window display.\n\n<b>                                      CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>146   INT:   MARSHA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT\n</b><b>\n</b>      MARSHA has just removed her dress and stands in      her bra and\n      panties as LANGFORD unwraps the last tape from      about his\n      ankles.

The\n      HALF-STEWED MAN leans across his WOMAN to yell at PUPKIN\n      as the two FRIENDS in windbreakers congratulate PUPKIN at\n      the same time.

He sits enthralled by a scene\n<b>\n</b>of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston\nStrangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE\nto offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument\nover the relative merits of their brothers.
