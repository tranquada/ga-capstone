Previously worthless\n          cattle running wild throughout\n          Texas were gathered into herds \n          And driven north to the railheads \n          In Kansas.  Fortunes were made as \n          Cowtowns sprang up on the \n          Prairies, wide-open centers of\n          Commerce and vice, their streets\n          Choked with heavily-armed young\n          Men fresh from the cattle drives.\n          In those days the correct term\n          For a cowhand was 'drover'.\n          'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was\n          originally an insult implying\n          deviant sexuality and was rarely\n          used.  But these invading drovers\n          were a wild breed for soon\n          shootings and wholesale drunken\n          riots became so frequent that\n          ordinary citizens literally could\n          not walk down the street.  In fact\n          at their height the cowtowns had\n          higher murder rates than modern\n          New York or Los Angeles and there\n          Was no law but that of the gun.\"\n\nA dashing FIGURE in a Prince Albert coat appears, long locks \ntumbling down his shoulders, twin Navy Colts thrust into a red \nsash at his waist, a tin star on his chest.

Wyatt turns back to his horse testily.  \nSuddenly:\n\n<b>                     O.S. VOICE\n</b>          Boy, I'd know that sour face\n          Anywhere.\n\nWyatt turns.  His brothers stand behind him, smiling.  Though \nVIRGIL is a little older and heavier.  MORGAN a little younger \nand slimmer, they're otherwise identical to Wyatt, right down \nto their style of dress.  Wyatt breaks into a grin, hugging \nthem both, his cool replaced with an almost boyish enthusiasm.\n\n<b>                     MORGAN\n</b>          Well how do we look?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Hey!

God\n          Almighty\n\nWyatt smiles, shaking his head. Morgan's starts to speak, but:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Don't talk, just...yeah.\n\nThey stand silently, studying themselves, together as a \nfamily.  Wyatt still shaking his head happily, drinking it in.  \nFinally:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right, now let's go make our fortune.\n<b>          DELETED\n</b>\n<b>EXT - WAGON - MAGIC HOUR\n</b>\nA large woman, Wyatt's black horses tied to the rear, crosses \nthe majestic, forbidding Arizona desert with its red volcanic \nrocks and the giant saguaro cactus dotting the landscape so \nmysteriously, like huge, spiny hieroglyphics....\n\n<b>EXT - CAMP BY RIVER - NIGHT\n</b>\nA camp by the river under a clear night sky dripping with \nstars.  After dinner.  The women, Virgil, and Morgan sit by \nthe fire.  Morgan petting his dog, a sweet little foxhound.  \nLouisa sits behind him, twirling his silky blonde hair, \nturning to Mattie:\n\n<b>                     LOUISA\n</b>          Don't you love their hair?  They\n          All have the same hair.\n\nJust then Wyatt appears on his stallion, galloping across the \nmoonlit plain toward them, sitting his horse like a centaur.  \nIt's clear he's a magnificent horseman.  Virgil smiles:\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          Look at him go, will ya?  I tell \n          You, that's the real Wyatt, born\n          In the saddle.\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          Oh, he can go all right.\n\n<b>                     ALLIE\n</b>          Can he then?\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          Rather ride than eat.\n\nThe women cackle lasciviously.  Virgil groans at Allie:\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          Try to be a lady, will you?\n\nWyatt rides up and dismounts, unsaddling the horse.\n\n<b>                     MORGAN\n</b>          Give him some good exercise?  Sure\n          Some stud.  Some string in fact.\n          What're you gonna do, race 'em?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Hope so.  Clean up with this boy.\n\nLouisa turns to Mattie, fishing in her bag:\n\n<b>                     LOUISA\n</b>          Mattie hon', did you say you\n          Needed some laudanum?  I have a \n          Bottle right here.  Just be \n          Careful.  It's full of hop.\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          You're a lifesaver!  Don't worry,\n          I just get headaches sometimes.\n\nAs Wyatt leads the horse away the women get up, Allie and \nLouisa going to the river with dishes, Mattie crossing to the \nwagon.  Virgil and Morgan watch her appreciatively:\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          Mighty fine.  Wonder where he\n          Found her.  Same place we found\n          Ours probably\n\nAt the other end of camp Mattie climbs into the wagon and lies \ndown.  Wyatt appears and starts to stroke her head.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Come up to the fire, honey.\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          I think I'll just lie down awhile\n\nA coyote starts HOWLING from the far darkness.  Mattie \nshudders:\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          Long as I live I'll never\n          Get used to that sound.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          They're just lonely is all.  Hell,\n          I howl myself sometimes.\n\n<b>                     MATTIE\n</b>          You get lonely?\n\nShe seems genuinely surprised.  Wyatt looks genuinely \nconfused.  Over at the fire, Morgan hugs and mashes Louisa \nplayfully.\n\n<b>                     MORGAN\n</b>          Come up, Lou.  Come up here, girl.\n\n<b>                     LOUISA\n</b>          Stop...\n\nShe fights loose.  Wyatt walks up, sits, shaking his gold \nwatch.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Look at that.  Busted.  Brand new \n          Money Ward, too.  33 years old \n          And I don't even have a decent\n          Watch.

At a corner table, the pot is \nso rich 2 players have folded leaving ED BAILEY, a big, \nsullen, tough-looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant DOC \nHOLLIDAY.  Full of southern refinement and languid, almost \nfeline grace.  Doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he \nmakes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely \nclearing his throat.  Bailey leans forward, seething with \nimpatience:\n\n<b>                     BAILEY\n</b>          I said that's 500 to you,\n          Holliday.

Sly boots, must be a peach\n          of a hand.\n\nKATE HORONY, Doc's voluptuous Hungarian consort enters, \nrefilling his engraved silver stirrup cup.  She has a faint \naccent:\n\n<b>                     KATE\n</b>          Here, Doc.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Bless you, darling\n               (puts arm around her)\n          Darling!

You know, Ed, if\n          I thought you weren't my friend I\n          Don't think I could bear it.\n\nNow a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well \nsteals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated .38 \nColt Lightning and .45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          There, now we can be friends\n          Again.  But remember, Ed,\n          Friendship is trust-so please\n          Don't hurt me.\n\nDoc bats his eyelashes.  Bailey jumps up, boiling.  A long, \nsweaty moment, then Bailey LUNGES.  Doc spring up, grabbing \nhim by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit.  \nBailey screams and doubles over.  Doc gives him two more \nblows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're \nhaving.  But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE \nthat there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand.  The bartender reaches for \nthe shotgun under the bar.  Kate pulls a Derringer from her \nmuff and puts it to his ear.\n\n<b>                     KATE\n</b>          Touch that gun, I burn you down!\n\nHe backs off.  Kate covers the room.

Good.\n\nEyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into \nBailey's face.  Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position.  \nKate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking \naround the room.  Then both back up to the door.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Well, good evening then.\n\nThey exit.  The others look down at the groaning Bailey lying \nin a pool of his own blood.  A GAMBLER shakes his head:\n\n<b>                     1ST GAMBLER\n</b>          Judas...\n\n<b>EXT - STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT\n</b>\nDoc and Kate stride quickly down the board sidewalk to the \nhotel.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I calculate that's the end of \n          This town.

As the Earps drive up we \nSEE a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the \nstreet while her husband tries to comfort her.  3 small \nchildren stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as \nCowboys FRANK STILLWELL, cocky, arrogant, and PETE SPENCE, \nlean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the \ncottage into the street while snarling things like, \"shut \nup...deadbeats...move it!\"  The Earps stop, staring at this \nscene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight.  Virgil \nrestrains her, Stillwell looks up:\n\n<b>                     STILLWELL\n</b>          What're you lookin' at?\n\nVirgil looks at Wyatt who shakes his head.  They drive on \nas....\n\n\n<b>EXT - ALLEN STRESS, TOMBSTONE - DAY\n</b>\nUnlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, \nTombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a \nwild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half-\nfinished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and \nshanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of \nthe desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond.  We HEAR \nthe vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy-\ngurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as \nthe Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with \nsaloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, \nChinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases.  They pull up in \nfront of the Grand Hotel and step down.  JOHNNY BEHAN, \nhandsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold \nsheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands:\n\n<b>                     BEHAN\n</b>          Newcomers, eh?

More GUNFIRE as a man holding a bloody hand to his \nthroat reels out the door of the nearby Crystal Palace, his \ngun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches \nface first onto the sidewalk, dead.  Immediately 2 more men \nappear: a staggering DRUNK with a bullet hole in his shoulder; \nand TURKEY CREEK JACK JOHNSON, a leathery plainsman with his \ngun at the ready.

Up above, the Earps sit in a box, the women \nthrilled:\n\n<b>                     ALLIE\n</b>          This is so much fun!

And the big boys: Curly\n          Bill Brocius, he's the Old Man's\n          Rimrod; the one looks like an\n          Actor, that's Johnny Ringo.  Best\n          Gun alive they say.

The house lights dim.  The audience hushes.  A \nspotlight hits easel at the end of the stage: \"Professor \nGillman and His Ballet of Gravity.\"  Out in the audience, \nBarnes groans:\n\n<b>                     BARNES\n</b>          Professor Gilllman?  Oh hell, I\n          Seen him in Bisbee.  He catches stuff.\n\nThe curtain goes up.  PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in \nwhite tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts \ntossing Indian clubs in the air.  The audience starts groaning \nbut the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes.  Having \nseen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts:\n\n<b>                     STILLWELL\n</b>          Hey profesor!  Catch this!\n\nStillwell raises his pistol and FIRES.  An Indian club \nexplodes in the Professor's hand.  Screams and scattered \nlaughter in the audience.  The Professor is frozen in utter \nshock, staring at the bullet graze on his hand and saying out \nloud:\n\n<b>                     GILLMAN\n</b>          They shot me!

In the audience, Curly \nBill's mouth drops:\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Prettiest man I ever saw\n\nFabian throws open his cloak, revealing his lithe form in \ndoublet and tights.

Henry, the young\n          King of England, addresses his men\n          Thusly: \"My cousin Westmorland?\n          No, my fair cousin-\"\n\nAnother GUNSHOT and a bullet SPANGS into the column next to \nFabian with a shower of plaster.  Without missing a beat, \nFabian casually flicks a chunk off his shoulder and continues:\n\n<b>                     FABIAN\n</b>          \"If we are marked to die, we are\n          enow/ To do our country loss; and\n          if to live./ The fewer me, the\n          greater the share of honour...\"\n\nIn the audience Barnes holsters his smoke pistol reflectively.\n\n<b>                     BARNES\n</b>          He's got nerve, I'll say that.\n          What do you think, Billy?\n\nStarry-eyed, Breakenridge answers without thinking:\n\n<b>                     BREAKENRIDGE\n</b>          Oh, he wonderful!\n\n<b>                     GROUNDS\n</b>          Uh-oh, looks like somebody's in love.\n\nRaw laughter from the others.

Another card: \"Faust - or the Devil's \nBargain\" and the orchestra whirls into \"Danse Macabre\" by \nSaint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained \nbackdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley-\nesque designs and images of death and damnation.  A light \ncomes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting \nalone with his books.  Then a hooded Satan dances across the \nstage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches \nand black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and \nyouth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina.  The old \nman succumbs, signing Satan's contract.  The audience watches \nin rapt attention, especially the Cowboys:\n\n<b>                     STILLWELL\n</b>          He's gonna some up short on that one.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Know what I'd do?

What would you do?\n\n<b>                     RINGO\n</b>          I already did it.\n\nSatan makes a flourish.  A flash-pad EXPLOSION transforms the \nold scholar into a young student.  The ballerina flits by.  \nThe student offers her gold.  They dance, swirling about the \nstage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, \nmirroring their every move like a puppet master.  Finally, \nhaving gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving \nthe young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back \ninto the old scholar sitting with his books.  Satan appears \nover him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt \nas the curtain falls with a final crashing chord.  Thunderous \ncheering and applause.  The curtain rises again and the \nperformers come out for bows, all except Satan.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Very instructive\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          But who was the Devil?\n\nSuddenly Satan bounds out, removing the hood.

Ringo does a \ndazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel-plated pistol \nflashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back \ninto his holster with a flourish.  Cheers and hoots.  Doc \nrolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his \nsilver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of Ringo's \nroutine using a cup instead of a gun.  The room bursts into \nlaughter.  Doc shrugs.  Ringo lets a strange little hint of a \nsmile cross his face then exits with the others.  White \nexhales, turns to Wyatt:\n\n<b>                     WHITE\n</b>          See what I mean about it getting\n          Spooky?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Curly Bill, huh?

Outside the others mount up \nbut Curly Bill stands drugged-up in the middle of the street, \narms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the \nmoonlight.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Boy, I feel great!

Back inside the Oriental it's late, few patrons \nremain.  A few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as GUNSHOTS \necho from outside.  White goes to the window, looks outside:\n\n<b>                     WHITE\n</b>          Curly Bill.

Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Why don't you just leave it alone?\n\n<b>                     WHITE\n</b>          No, I gotta do something.

Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting.  \nWhite steps out into the street.  We feel a sense of inverted \nterror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is \ntrembling.  He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly \nBill:\n\n<b>                     WHITE\n</b>          Hey, Curly?  Come on now, boy...\n\nCurly Bill spins around.  White's gun stares him in the face.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Well, howdy, Fred!\n\nBack in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Maybe I ought to go out there.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          You will or you won't.  Don't look\n          To me.  I'm going to sleep.\n\nDoc lays his head down on the keys, passes out.  Wyatt frowns \nfor a moment.  Finally he stands, turning to Morgan:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Go wake up Virgil.\n               (turns to Joyce)\n          Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?\n\nJoyce hands him a Colt from under the bar.  Outside White \ncovers Curly Bill, trembling harder now.  An adrenaline rush \nin a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so \nvulnerable.  Even his voice has a quavering edge to it:\n\n<b>                     WHITE\n</b>          Hand that over.  Come on now.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Why sure, dad.  I'm only in fun.\n          Here she is.\n\nWith a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt-\nfirst.  White reaches for it, visibly relieved.  But quick as \na snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and FIRES POINT \nBLANK into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast \nso close it sets his clothes on fire.   Curly Bill turns just \nas Wyatt flashes into frame and SLAMS him over the head with \nhis pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap.  Wyatt \nglances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest \nheaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like \nsounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest.  Clum \nruns up:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Put his clothes out.\n\nClum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt \nstarts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself \nsurrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys.\n\n<b>                     IKE\n</b>          Turn loose of him.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          He just killed a man.\n\n<b>                     BILLY\n</b>          He said to turn loose of him.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Well I'm not so go home.\n\n<b>                     IKE\n</b>          Swear to God, Mister, step aside\n          Or we'll tear you apart.\n\nThe Cowboys tense up, ready for action.  Wyatt holds his \nground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          You.  Come here a second.\n\nIke steps up, full of brass.  Without warning Wyatt jabs the \nmuzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head \nback.  Wyatt cocks the pistol.  The other Cowboys hush.  Ike \nfreezes.  Wyatt's eyes bore into him.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          You die first, get it?  The others \n          Might get me in a rush but before\n          That I'm gonna make your head\n          Into a canoe.  Understand?\n\nIke stands stock still.  Billy steps forward, undaunted:\n\n<b>                     BILLY\n</b>          He's bluffin'!  Let's rush him!\n\nThis is it.  The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, \nbut:\n\n<b>                     O.S. VOICE\n</b>          And you, you simpleton, you're next.\n\nAgain a hush.  Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with \nhis .38 trained on Billy.  Billy sneers:\n\n<b>                     BILLY\n</b>          Hell, he can't hit nothin'.  He's \n          So drunk he's probably seein'\n          Double.\n\nDoc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on Billy:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I have two guns.  One for each of you.\n\nBilly pauses, chastened.  Suddenly there's another commotion \nas Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from \nbehind with shotguns.\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          All right, look out!  Break it up.\n          Go home, all of you, go home now...\n\nThis breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down \ndramatically as the Cowboys disperse.  Wyatt lowers his \npistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy \nCurly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Come on, you...\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Crack me back of the head like\n          Some stinkin' bull.

As the Earps and Doc step out on the sidewalk we can \nsee the semi-conscious Curly Bill through the front door of \nthe jail laying in one of the cells, holding a bloody kerchief \nto his head.  Wyatt closes the door, locks it, gives Clum the \nkeys.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          There.  He'll keep till morning\n\nThe street is quiet as they start back toward the Oriental.  \nVirgil and Morgan following at a discreet distance, smirking:\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          Keep your eye on that brass ring.\n          Don't let anything side-track you.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          I know, I need a keeper.\n\nMeanwhile across the street at the hotel Josephine turns to \nBehan.\n\n<b>                     BEHAN\n</b>          Well I guess you can see, never a \n          Dull moment.

Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, \neyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and \nnothing like their legend.  It's only Doc, bringing up the \nrear, who couldn't care less.

Now at the end of the \nsidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed \nand their relief evaporates.  Wyatt mutters under his breath:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Oh, great.  Disarmed my ass...\n\nThe Earps slow their step, gathering themselves.  This is it, \nno turning back now.  The Cowboys spread out.  As the Earps \nget closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric \nwith tension.  But as they step into the street and fan out \nfor their final approach, they suddenly do look like their \nlegend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a \nline, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen \nforever in our minds.  Finally they stop.  The 2 groups are \nfacing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart.  Doc raises the \nshotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face.  \nVirgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane:\n\n<b>                     VIRGIL\n</b>          We've come to arrest you.  Throw\n          Up your arms!\n\nA weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to \ndo.  Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to \ntheir guns.

I don't want that!\n\nSuddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt \nand dash into Fly's gallery.  Everyone else stands frozen, \nbreath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's \nwide-open eyes.  Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems \nto go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful \nrealization hits him:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Oh, my God...\n\nBilly and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, \neverything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and \nFIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot.  Morgan FIRES, \nblowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house.  Tom \ndarts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt \nshrieking like a woman:\n\n<b>                     IKE\n</b>          No, no, please!

Tom \nFIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is \nblocked by the horse.  Billly bounces back up, howling, and \nFIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf.  He drops to one \nknee.  Tom FIRES again.  Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, \nthe BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split \nsecond.  Doc FIRES again.  Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, \nthe full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot \nSLAMMING him into the Harwood house.  Tom drops his gun and \nteeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, \nalready dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head \ncut off.  Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in \nhis shoulder.\n\n\n<b>                     MORGAN\n</b>          I'm hit.\n\nDoc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, \nhitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the \nfight, FIRING wildly.  Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK.  The whole \nscene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling \ninto the street, each man jockeying for position.  Inside the \ngallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in.  \nHe snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window.  \nIke's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear.  He spins around, calling \nto Doc:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Behind us!\n\nIn a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, \nreplacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then \nwith one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine \ngun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the \ngallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken \nglass.\n\n<b>                     BEHAN\n</b>          Come on!\n\nBehan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and \nClaiborne right behind, all frantically running for their \nlives.  Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly \nindestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt,  Wyatt RETURNS FIRE.  Eyes \nwild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank \nstaggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the \nsmoke:\n\n<b>                     FRANK\n</b>          I got you now, you son of a bitch!\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          You're a daisy if you do!\n\nDoc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest.  \nFrank FIRES.  The bullet grazes Doc's holster.  Frank trudges \ncloser, about to fire again but Doc DRILLS him through the \nheart while in the next millisecond Morgan FIRES from his \nprone position on the ground, the big .45 BLAST carrying away \nthe top of Frank's head.  As the last shot echoes through the \nhills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while \nout in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam \nand pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, \nleaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front \nof him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and \nwailing piteously as the smoke clears:\n\n<b>                     BILLY\n</b>          More cartridges!  Somebody load my gun...\n\nHe keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step \ntimidly into the street.  Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun \nfrom his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted \nonly some 20 seconds.  Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan \nstrides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt:\n\n<b>                     BEHAN\n</b>          All right.  You're all under\n          Arrest.\n\nWyatt looks at him in utter disbelief.  Finally:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          I don't think I'll let you arrest\n          Us today, Behan.  Maybe tomorrow.\n\nMore bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing.  The \nEarp women run up from the west end of Fremont.  Josephine \nfights her way through the crowd from the east.  She and Wyatt \ncatch sight of each other.  She grins, tears in her eyes.  He \nnods, smiling.  Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes.  And so \ndoes MATTIE who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run \nto their men, hugging them.  Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's \nbody, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his \nbreath:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          You call that shooting?\n\n<b>                     FLY\n</b>               (comes up to Wyatt)\n          The McLaurys are both dead.

Morgan lies \nacross the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking \nand shuddering involuntarily.  Wyatt rushes to him.  The dog \nwhines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters.  Wyatt is \ntrembling.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No, no!  Get the doctor!  Jesus Christ!\n\n<b>INTO - ORIENTAL - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe curious crowd outside, watching through the windows.  \nMorgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt \npulled up.  The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. \nGoodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making \nMorgan writhe in perfect agony.  The doctor turns to Wyatt:\n\n<b>                     DR. GOODFELLOW\n</b>          Hold him.\n\nWyatt takes Morgan in his arms.  The doctor probes.  Morgan \njerks violently.  Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM.  \nLouisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter \nhysterics.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Oh, no, get her out of her!  Jesus!\n\nAnd now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the \ndog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and \nMorgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip.  The doctor \nsnarls, about at the end of his rope.\n\n<b>                     DR. GOODFELLOW\n</b>          I said hold him, God damn it!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Somebody shut that dog up!\n\nMorgan takes Wyatt's arm, his voice like a child's.\n\n<b>                     MORGAN\n</b>          You were right, Wyatt.  They got\n          Me good.

I can't see a damn thing.\n\nTears well up in Wyatt's eyes.  He touches his brother's face.  \nMorgan's eyelids start fluttering.  Wyatt squeezes his hand.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Morgan?  Morgan!\n\nThe dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the \nnext moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and \ncoyote for miles joins in the mourning.  Wyatt backs away from \nhis dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at \nthe blood on his hands.  Standing in the crowd across the \nstreet, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him.  Behan grabs \nher.  She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, \nstarts running toward Wyatt.  Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in \nhorror, shaking his head:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No, no, get away, get away from me...\n\n<b>                     JOSEPHINE\n</b>          Wyatt...\n\nShe keeps coming.  Wyatt panics.  Finally, in desperation:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Whore!  Filthy whore!  Get away\n          From me!\n\nShe pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying.  \nFuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt.  Doc pulls her \nback:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Can't you see why he did it?\n\nThe howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone.  \nSuddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, \nstaring at his bloody hands....\n\n<b>EXT - ALLEN STREET - DAY\n</b>\nThe wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, \nhitched and ready.  Virgil is up front with the women, arm in \na sling, pale.  Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby.  Finished \nloading, Wyatt looks around.  People line the street, watching \nin silence.  Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the \nwindow of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze.  \nThe very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as \nif the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active.  \nBystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and \nimpervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink \ncoat, her little white dog scampering after her.  Passing \nBehan, he gives her nasty look and spits.  She doesn't even \nbreak stride.  Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with \nthe other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring \nlook.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Naw, she's nobody.  Wyatt junked her.\n\nPassing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him.  Doc sighs:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          And so she walked out of our \n          Lives forever.\n\nWithout a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the \nreins, driving off.  He pulls up in front of the Cowboys.  \nThey make a show of pretending to hide their guns.  Wyatt \nlooks straight ahead:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          I want you to know it's over.\n          We're leaving and we're not\n          Coming back.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Well...

The Cowboys \nsnicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight \nahead, and drives on.  A few beats then Curly Bill turns to \nIke:\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Take Frank and finish it.\n\n<b>EXT - TRAIN STATION, TUCSON - NIGHT\n</b>\nA train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds \nwhile 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar.  Up ahead, \nMattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts \nVirgil into a passenger car.  As we HEAR the conductor's voice \nshouting, \" 'Board!\", Ike and Stillwell emerge from the \nshadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns.  They \nexchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, \nsquinting through the steam:\n\n<b>                     STILLWELL\n</b>          That's Virgil with the women.  But \n          Where the hell's Wyatt?\n\n<b>                     O.S. VOICE\n</b>          Right behind you, Stillwell.\n\nThey spin around.  Wyatt stands behind them, looking down the \nbarrels of Virgil's big 10 gauge.  Stillwell raises his \nshotgun, Wyatt FIRES.  Stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled \nheap, his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags.

She smiles, \nwiping flour from her hands.  Wyatt smiles thoughtfully, moved \nby this unexpected encounter....\n\n<b>EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - MORNING\n</b>\nNext morning.  Doc gallops into camp with McMasters, Texas \nJack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, exchanging \ngreetings with Wyatt who leads him over to the center of the \ncamp, then:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Know why you're here?\n\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          Way ahead of you, Wyatt.

Vermillion nods to Johnson who crouches down with \na pair of dice.  He makes one pass, two passes... Finally:\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Crapped out.  Okay, we're in.\n\n<b>EXP - WAGON TRAIN CAMP/DESERT - DAY\n</b>\nThe thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle \nin a scabbard and a double-barreled shotgun across the saddle \nfork.  Lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as Wyatt's \nmen, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          The minute we start we'll be\n          Going against local and county\n          Law.  If we fail the U.S.\n          Government won't be able to lift\n          A finger to help us.  Nevertheless\n          I want you to understand we carry\n          The full force and authority of\n          The law of this land.\n\nThey exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the \nmagnitude of what they're about to attempt.  Wyatt faces them:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Raise your right hands.  Do you\n          Solemnly swear to uphold the laws\n          And constitution of the United\n          States of America and to protect\n          her citizens to the best of your\n          Ability, even at the cost of your\n          Own life?\n\nAll chorus, \"I do\", except for Doc who rolls his eyes.  \nFinally:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Oh...

My\n          Hypocrisy only goes so far.\n\nWyatt shrugs.  They mount up, about to begin, but suddenly:\n\n<b>                     LUCINDA\n</b>          Wait!\n\nLucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and \ngold silk scarf around his neck.\n\n<b>                     LUCINDA\n</b>          Your colors.\n\nWyatt nods his surprised thanks as the wagonmaster steps up:\n\n<b>                     WAGONMASTER\n</b>          Good luck, boys.  And give 'em hell!\n\nThey shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men.  They take off \nat a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall \nand the desert beyond.  Unable to contain himself any longer, \nLucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, \nspurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast:\n\n<b>                     LUCINDA'S SON\n</b>          Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man,\n          Whistling death and bloody\n          Murder!

Best 'em all\n          And break 'em up and bang their\n          Heads together in a bunch and\n          Give no quarter though they be\n          Ten times ten thousand!\n\nWyatt turns in the saddle, sweeping off his hat with a \ncavalier's flourish as he and his men take the deadfall in a \nsingle bound and pass into the desert.  An immigrant FATHER \ngrabs his infant son, lifting him up.\n\n<b>                     ILLINOIS MOTHER\n</b>          What're you doing?\n\n<b>                     ILLINOIS FATHER\n</b>          Someday he'll be able to say he\n          Was there when Wyatt Earp rode \n          Out to bring the law.\n\nMusic up, avenging and bright, as Wyatt and his men ride \nthrough the desert, 5 abreast on their giant chargers, glossy \nblack coats shimmering in the sunlight, hoofbeats pounding in \nunison.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right, let's wring 'em out!\n\nThey break into a dead run, streaking across the frame.  As \nthey crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and \nfor a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, \nflying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth.  \nJohnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of \nbeing alive:\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Like flyin', son.  Just like flyin'.\n\n<b>EXT - RUSTLERS PARK - LATE DAY\n</b>\nThe sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge \noverlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several \nCowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on \nbedrolls, laughing and drinking.  On the other side, at the \nfoot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over \na fire, cooking.  Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far \nend of the ridge start bleating.  Spence turns to Pony Deal \nwho shrugs:\n\n<b>                     PONY DEAL\n</b>          Maybe they smell a wolf.\n\n<b>SPENCE\n</b>               (turns to other Cowboy)\n          Go up there and take a look.\n\nThe Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far \nside of the ridge.  Spence and the others continue cooking.  \nMoments later a CRASHING SOUND comes echoing over the ridge \nlike thunder.  The Cowboys look up, startled.  Pony Deal \npoints:\n\n<b>                     PONY DEAL\n</b>          Look!\n\nThe pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge.  The Cowboys \nexchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far \nend of the ridge.  Then the five black horsemen ride out of \nthe sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of \nthe ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the \nspeed of a flame.  They are within a few yards of the fire \nwhen Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and:\n\n<b>                     BARNES\n</b>          Look out!\n\nSpence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before \nWyatt and his horsemen SLAM into them with terrifying impact, \nthe bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves.  The \nCowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, \nstumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as \nthe possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols \nBLAZING in air, horses rearing and snorting.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          United States Marshals!  Reach!\n\nEveryone freezes.  A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back \nbehind the others, trying not to be spotted.  Meanwhile Doc \nleans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's \nforehead.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Say something witty.\n\nThey herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, \"Get \nover there!\",  \"Move it!\", etc.  But Barnes brazens up to \nWyatt:\n\n<b>                     BARNES\n</b>          Hey, you can't come-\n\nA loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          One more word and I'll blind you.\n          Get over there!\n\n<b>                     PONY DEAL \n</b>               (to McMasters)\n          Hey brother, what're you doin'-\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          I ain't your brother, I ain't\n          None of your damn brothers.  Move!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right, run 'em off.\n\nDoc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their \nherd with pistol shots.  Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt:\n\n<b>                     SWILLING\n</b>          Bastard!  Stinkin' bastard!  Like\n          To eat you blood raw!\n\nA queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right, breed.  Dig in.\n\nAnd then Wyatt DRILLS him in the jaw with a straight right \nhand.  Swilling drops like a stone.  Wyatt hauls him up by the \nhair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, \nand pile-drives a left hook to his gut.  Swilling topples back \ninto a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes \nout.  Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and \nmakes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          It appears he missed an excellent \n          Chance to keep his mouth shut.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>               (faces Cowboys)\n          Felt his liver go on that last\n          One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll\n          Be dead in a couple hours.\n\nAt the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off \nbareback.  McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its \nscabbard:\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          Florentino!  He's getting away!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Drop his horse.\n\nMcMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 \nWinchester and FIRES.  100 yards away, the bullet hits \nFlorentino's horse in the shoulder with a \"thunk\".  It drops, \ntumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into \nthe ground.  He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts \nrunning.  Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, \nclosing the distance in seconds.  Florentino gasps and runs \nfaster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top \nof him.  He turns and FIRES on the run.  A branch next to \nWyatt's head EXPLODES.  Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his \nBuntline, impervious, unstoppable.  Florentino turns for \nanother shot just as the black PILES into him, sending him \nflying and tumbling him down an embankment.  He scrambles to \nhis feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with \ndeliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in \nfront of him.  Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, \nshaking his head:\n\n<b>                     FLORENTINO\n</b>          I don't kill your brother!  I \n          Don't even know him.  I was only\n          Lookout.  It was money, they give\n          Me twelve dollars!  It was money!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          A human life.  Twelve dollars.\n\nWyatt nods, still coming, cold-blooded murder in his eye.  \nFlorentino screams, raising his gun:\n\n<b>                     FLORENTINO\n</b>          No!\n\nWyatt FIRES, blasting Florentino to the ground.  He advances, \nFIRING over and over, emptying his gun into him....\n\n<b>EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - LATE DAY\n</b>\nThe Cowboys watch as Wyatt gallops up, dragging Florentino's \nbullet-riddled body behind him.  He reins up, un-dallying the \nrope.  The corpse flops at their feet.  They jump back, \nhorrified.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Look at him.  That's how you'll\n          All end up if you don't get it\n          Through your head: it's over,\n          The Cowboys're finished.  Forever.\n          So tell the others and get out of\n          The Territory 'cause next time I\n          Leave no one alive.  Understand?\n          No one.  You been warned.\n               (to his men)\n          All right, burn it!  Everything!\n\nAs his men prepare to fire the camp, several Cowboys move to \npick up Floretino's body, but:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Leave that trash where it lays.\n\n<b>EXT - RUSTLER'S PARK - DUSK\n</b>\nWyatt and his men ride through the blazing camp, the flames \nlighting up his eyes like a demon's....\n\n<b>EXT - DESERT CAMP - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe possemen crouch by their fire.  Doc sits shivering \nmiserably by himself as Vermillion turns to Johnson.\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          You know, we might just pull this off.\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me\n          It gets harder from here in.\n               (pauses)\n          Should've held out for more money.\n\nMeanwhile Wyatt and McMasters confer over a map.  Wyatt points \nto a specific point on the map, very interested:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          I know that cut.  You mean there's\n          A waterhole near there?\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          But this time they'll be ready.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          We'll see about that.\n\n<b>EXT - DESERT/MOUNTAIN CUT - DAY\n</b>\nNow we see what so interested Wyatt-it's the same mountain cut \nwhere he and Josephine met.  Pony Deal and a party of 10 \nCowboys ride through the desert 300 yards from the cut, \npushing a herd.\n\n<b>                     PONY DEAL\n</b>          Keep your eyes open for Earp's \n          Bunch.  Swear to God, ain't gonna\n          Get the drop on us this time.\n\n<b>                     1ST COWBOY\n</b>          Riders up ahead!  ...four, five.\n          It's them all right!\n\nThey look.  Wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth \nof the cut.  They tense, the 1st Cowboy squinting against the \nsun.  At the cut, Wyatt and his men poise themselves, Doc \nnodding:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          They saw us.  Here they come.\n\nThe Cowboys charge forward, outnumbering them better than 2 to \n1 and only 100 yards away.  The possemen choke up on their \nreins, alerting their horses for action as:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Wait... wait... steady...\n\n75 yards and the first shots RING out, richochetting off the \nwalls of the cut.  The others blanch but Wyatt stays cool, \nwaiting, 50 yards... 40 yards... till we can see their eyes \nand:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Now!\n\nThey whirl around and disappear into the cut.  The Cowboys \nkeep coming.  Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading \nup the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine.  They \nclamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, \nas moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through \ninto the desert on the other side.  Wyatt's group careens up \nand around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, \nfollowing the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the \ntrail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the \nCowboys.  They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, \ndrawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert \nbefore them, unaware.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Lay on!\n\nThey CHARGE forward.  Seeing the empty desert ahead, the \nCowboys pull up, looking around in confusion.  Suddenly a \nVOLLEY of GUNFIRE hits them from behind, knocking several from \nthe saddle.  They spin around just as Wyatt's group SLAMS into \nthem HEAD-ON, guns BLAZING, Cowboys tumbling from the saddle \nleft and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards.\n\n<b>                     PONY DEAL\n</b>          Run!\n\nThe remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert.  Wyatt \nshouts:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Come on!\n\nWyatt's group CHARGES, the thoroughbreds closing the distance \nin seconds.  Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like \nan animal as he PLUNGES into them, swinging his quirt like a \nsaber and LASHING a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble \nto the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll.  \nMcMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and \nJERKING him from the saddle, SNAPPING his neck.  Doc overtakes \na 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and FIRES point-blank, \nblackening his face with soot and BLOWING out the back of his \nhead as he falls.  Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his \nshoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and FIRES.  The \nCowboy's head DISAPPEARS in a cloud of pink vapor, the body \ndropping like a stone....\n\nWyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run.  Pony Deal turns \nin the saddle and FIRES at him.  We feel a surge of breathless \nexhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a \nCommanche and ducks his body down against the side of his \nhorse, hiding in its lee.  Pony Deal turns for another shot \nonly to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him.  But \nin the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck \nand FIRES, blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of \nhis horse.  Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters \nrides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, \nthe 1st Cowboy.  Only a few yards in front of them, he whips \nhis horse frantically, trying to get away.  McMasters is about \nto fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot.  The Cowboy \nmakes it over a rise and disappears.\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          What'd you do that for?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          So he can tell the story.\n\n<b>EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT\n</b>\nCurly Bill studies a map drawn in the dirt, listening with \nRingo, Ike, etc. while the 1st Cowboy describes the battle:\n\n<b>                     1ST COWBOY\n</b>          Didn't make any sense.  One minute\n          We're chasin' 'em, next they're\n          Right on top of us.

Pretty damn cute.\n          But nobody's cute as me.\n               (points to dirt map)\n          Next up's Black Draw.  But that\n          Smart Wyatt'll say no, that's \n          Where they'll expect us to hit,\n          We'll hit the one after.  Iron\n          Springs.  That's where they show \n          Next.  Only I'm gonna be there\n          First.  And throw a little party.\n\nCurly Bill grins, his coarse face radiant in the firelight...\n\n<b>EXT - WYATT'S CAMP - NIGHT\n</b>\nDoc sits by the fire, shaking and shivering and sweating.  \nVermillion comes up and tries to cover him with a blanket, \nbut:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Don't touch me!\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          Sorry...\n\nHe pulls back.

Yeah, let's\n          Try there, Iron Springs.\n\n<b>EXT - IRON SPRINGS - DAWN\n</b>\nA camp near a waterhole with 2 Cowboys crouched by a fire, \nsipping coffee.  Wyatt's men ride up to the rocks overlooking \nit and dismount, unseen.\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          There they are.  No herd though.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          We'll go around that way, come up on foot.\n\nThey pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the \nrocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected.  \nBut suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and:\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          Ambush!  Get down!\n\nAnd suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side EXPLODES IN \nGUNFIRE.  Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, \nhugging the rocks.  A bullet RICHOCHETS into a rock at \nJohnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him \nwince:\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Christ!\n\nHunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more \nCowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Hey, Wyatt!  How the hell are you?\n\nWyatt and his men react to his voice.  The fire continues.  \nSuddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them.  Doc \npoints:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Look!\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Got some boys workin' around\n          Those rocks behind you.

How do you like that?\n\nSeeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent \nWyatt:\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          He's right.  They get set up in\n          Them rocks it's the end for us.\n\nAnd now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual \nnaked fear.  But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his \nlife.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          'Course you could give yourselves\n          up and we could have a party!\n          Then what larks!\n\nCrouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles.  A confident ripple \nof laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got \nthem.  On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly.\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!\n\nMcMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging \nhelplessly:\n\n<b>                     MCMASTERS\n</b>          Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.\n\nThey really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt \nfor a solution.  He remains silent.  Then suddenly, in this \nsupreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to \ncome over him and he says simply:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No.\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          What?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No.\n\nAnd now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as \nWyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in \nhorror, rises to his feet.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Wyatt!\n\nBullets WHIZ around him.  Doc jumps up to grab him but a \nRICOCHET drives him back down.  Wyatt advances quickly across \nthe clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, \nrepeating:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No...\n\nWyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but \nhe just keeps coming.  Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a \nweird, manic elation coming over him.  He hoots and howls:\n\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get\n          Some, boy!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No...\n\nCurly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, \n12 gauge shotgun in one hand, .45 in the other, BLASTING away.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you \n          Bastard...\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No...\n\nCurly Bill FIRES again.  Wyatt's hat flies off.  He FIRES \nagain, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel.  Now Curly Bill \ntakes dead aim with his .45 and-CLICK-it's empty.  He tosses \nit aside.  Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of \nWyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances.  \nEyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his \nshotgun.\n\n<b>                     CURLY BILL\n</b>          Die!  Son of a bitch!  Die!\n\nHe FIRES.  Wyatt's coattails EVAPORATE into swirling shreds as \nhe takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing \nthrough clenched teeth:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No!\n\nAnd with that, Wyatt lets go with BOTH BARRELS.  Curly Bill's \nmid-section VAPORIZES, the huge double-charge of buckshot \nRIPPING HIM COMPLETELY IN HALF.  The other Cowboys flinch as \nthey're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore.  Barnes \nscreams:\n\n<b>                     BARNES\n</b>          Jesus Christ!\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No!\n\nEyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and \nFIRES.  Barnes doubles over.  Wyatt FIRES again.  Barnes \ndrops.  The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are \nliving in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, STILL \nFIRING.  Another goes down.  Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in \nhand, and:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Come on!\n\nNow they all rise and OPEN FIRE, advancing 4 abreast, a WALL \nOF GUNFIRE driving the remaining Cowboys off, running for \ntheir horses.  Wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the \nothers run up.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          No...\n\nBeside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him \ndown and examining him, running his hands all over his body.  \nThe others FIRE at the Cowboys retreating on horseback.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Wyatt, my God!

Meanwhile Wyatt starts to tremble....\n\n<b>EXT - CAMP - NIGHT\n</b>\nThey're camped by a running stream.  Wyatt stares into the \nfire.  Doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I\n          Literally don't care if I live or\n          Die.  But even I can't fight human\n          Instinct.  Somebody suddenly\n          Starts shooting at me, I duck.\n          But you... what on earth were\n          You thinking about?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          I don't know.

Swear\n          To God, Doc, I just don't know.\n\nAt the other end of camp, Vermillion and Johnson sit together.  \nAfter a beat:\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          Hey Creek, you ever see anything\n          Like that before?\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Never even heard of anything like it.\n\nVermillion nods.  Both look shaken to the very core of their \nbeings.  Finally:\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          I just thought of somethin' I \n          Never thought about before.\n               (pauses, looks at him)\n          I don't want to go to hell.\n\n<b>EXT - CAMP - MORNING\n</b>\nWyatt sits by the fire, sipping coffee.  Vermillion and \nJohnson approach.  Johnson drops a wad of money on Wyatt's \nbedroll.  Wyatt looks up in surprise:\n\n<b>                     VERMILLION\n</b>          Talked it over.  We decided we\n          Don't need the money.  Took out 13\n          Dollars each, though.  Federal\n          Posseman's fee.  That all right?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Sure...\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          One thing.  We come through this\n          Alive, can we keep the badges?\n\nWyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward \nthe stream by himself.

Walking on water.\n\n<b>EXT - COWBOY CAMP - NIGHT\n</b>\nRingo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a \ndeeply shadowed mask.  2 Iron Springs survivors stand before \nhim:\n\n<b>                     1ST COWBOY\n</b>          We hit him half a dozen times but\n          He just kept comin', walked right\n          Up to Curly Bill with that 10\n          Gauge and blew him up!\n\n<b>                     RINGO\n</b>          Curly Bill?

Then he turned \n          Around with that big Colt and \n          Killed Johnny Barnes, shot up a\n          Couple more 'fore we got out of \n          there.

The 2 survivors drop with bullets through \ntheir brains.  The others jump, transfixed by the insane \nbrutality of what he's just done.  Ringo draws himself up, in \nfull possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, \nmatchless:\n\n<b>                     RINGO\n</b>          Everybody get this through their\n          Heads.

Hooker shakes his head:\n\n<b>                     HOOKER\n</b>          I'm no doctor but he looks pretty bad.\n\nHis face creased with worry, Wyatt sits down next to Doc.  \nMcMasters motions to the others.

Shouting and \ncommotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with \nthe driver, then Behan turns to Ringo:\n\n<b>                     BEHAN\n</b>          Robbery.  2 men stuck 'em up and\n          Killed a passenger.

Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in \nJosephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the \ntroupe.  Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the \ndying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life.

And\n          Gentler and braver.  I don't\n          Understand any of this, I only\n          Know it's ugly.  You're all ugly\n          And he was beautiful, he tried to\n          Put something fine into your ugly\n          World and you killed him for it.\n          Anyway the ones who did it are \n          headed north.

Came her to water\n          Their horses before pushin' on.\n\nSeeing each other, Wyatt and Josephine freeze.

Funny thing\n          But I can't really remember how\n          She looked.  I can remember parts\n          Of her clear as crystal, her\n          Mouth, her walk, how she shut her\n          Eyes when she laughed, little\n          Bits and pieces, but not the\n          Whole package.  Can't put it\n          Together for some reason.\n\n<b>                     JOHNSON\n</b>          Good God, you're really-\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Cards in spades.

Breakenridge recoils in fright, \nstumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally \nFIRES.  Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief \non his dying face.  Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on \nBreakenridge, raising his gun and snarling.  Breakenridge \nFIRES again.  Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and \nfalling to his knees.  He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs \ntimidly:\n\n<b>                     BREAKENRIDGE\n</b>          Sorry.\n\nHunt falls over, dead.

Making his way \ndown the trail, Wyatt looks up at the sky.  A flock of wild \ngeese fly overhead in V-formation, oblivious to the human \ndrama below.  Wyatt stops, drinking it all in, as if trying to \ngrab all he can in the time left.  Suddenly he closes his \neyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first \ntime.  He clasps his hands:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Dear God, this is the last \n          Battle.

Wyatt \nstands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will \nhim into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time \nDoc looks back.  Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg \nover his horse and drops into the saddle.

Wyatt and his men keep \ncoming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, \nas before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and \nfor another burning moment they once again appear airborne, \ngrim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more \nmajestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, \nsuperb, and unutterably beautiful.  As they approach, only \nBreakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave.  Wyatt \npoints a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting \nanother rise and passing into legend....\n\n<b>INT - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\nThe CLOCK on the wall of this private DENVER hospital room \nticks gently but inexorably as Doc lies in bed with FATHER \nFEENEY, a Catholic priest, sitting at his side.  Painfully \nemaciated, his breathing shallow and labored, Doc is so weak \nit's all he can do to even move his eyes.  But he brightens as \nWyatt enters:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Well hell, Wyatt.  Wyatt, I want\n          You to meet Father Feeney.  Father\n          Feeney's just been initiating me\n          Into the mysteries of the great\n          And ancient Church of Rome.  You\n          See, it appears my hypocrisy\n          Knows no bounds.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          How you feelin', Doc?\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Rather an obvious question under\n          The circumstances, don't you\n          Agree?  A better one might be how\n          Do you feel?\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>               (sits down, sighs)\n          Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I imagine it would, yes.  So now\n          We can add self-pity to your list\n          Of frailties.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right, Doc...\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          You think I'm kidding.  You're the\n          Most fallible, wrong-headed, self-\n          Deluding, just generally\n          Benighted jackass I've ever\n          Known.  Yet, withal, even at your\n          Worst, you're the only human\n          Being in my entire life who ever\n          Gave me hope.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All I ever wanted was to live a \n          Normal life.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          When will you wake up?  You\n          Wouldn't know a normal life if it \n          Bit you in the ass.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          That's great coming from you.\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I played the cards I was dealt, \n          Wyatt.  Your problem is you're \n          Always trying to play someone\n          Else's.  Allow me to tell you the\n          Truth and thus set you free:\n          There is no happiness, Wyatt\n          There is no normal life.  There's\n          Only life, that's all.  Just life.\n          The rest is relative.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Then what do I do?\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          First you can grab that black-\n          Haired woman and make her your own.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          All right.  Then what?\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Run.  Take that girl and start\n          Running.  Run and don't look back.\n          All your life you been running\n          And looking back and just barely\n          Existing and calling it getting\n          By.  This time run and don't look\n          Back and call it living.  Live\n          Every second, live it right up to\n          The hilt.  Live, Wyatt...\n               (pauses, takes his hand)\n          Live for me.\n\nWyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in.  Just then, \nDoc looks up, as if something were pressing on him.  Then:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Wyatt, please, if you were ever\n          My friend, if you ever had even\n          The smallest feeling for me, \n          Leave.  Leave now.  Please.\n\nThey look at each other and something passes between them, \nsomething so personal and powerful it transcends emotion.  \nWyatt starts to speak, but:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Never mind, Wyatt.  I know.  Just go.\n\nDoc turns away.  Wyatt exits.  Doc looks over at Father \nFeeney:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          Now let's see, Father.  What was\n          That monkey show you were talking about?\n\n<b>                     FATHER FEENEY\n</b>          You mean Extreme Unction?\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          That's it.  Better start that ball rolling.\n\nFather Feeney nods, picking up his Missal.  As he starts to \nintone the Last Rites, Doc looks down at the end of the bed \nand sees his feet poking through the sheets.  They are bare.  \nDoc smiles:\n\n<b>                     DOC\n</b>          I'll be damned...\n               (looks at Feeney)\n          This is funny.\n\n<b>INT - DENVER THEATER STAGE - NIGHT\n</b>\nA lively road company production of \"H.M.S.

Screams and stunned reaction.  \nWyatt rushes in and goes to Josephine who sits in stunned \nsilence.  He falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe.\n\n<b>                     JOSEPHINE\n</b>          Wyatt!

My family's rich.\n\n<b>INT/EXT - TRAIN - DAY\n</b>\nBrilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles \nthrough a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its \nwhistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over \nthe sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the \ncrystal-clear sky above.  Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand \nthrough the parlor car, both hardly able to contain \nthemselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, \nlike children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to \nignore the group of REPORTERS dogging their footsteps, \nswarming around them, calling out to Wyatt:\n\n\n\n<b>                     1ST REPORTER\n</b>          Mr Earp!  One minute, please!  You\n          And your four men have just\n          Accomplished in one week what it\n          Took the Texas Rangers four years\n          To do.  Please, do you have any comment?\n\nWyatt and Josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of \nporters into the next car.  Only the 1st Reporter gives chase.  \nMoving into the passenger car furthest forward, Wyatt leads \nher through the door to the platform over the coupling between \ncars.  Chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest, the \ntrain is immersed in shadows.  Wyatt points ahead to the \napproaching crest:\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          There.  It'll come up over that ridge.\n\nInside meanwhile, the 1st Reporter comes through the car and \nspots them up.  A business-type PASSENGER tugs on his sleeve:\n\n<b>PASSENGER\n</b>What's the commotion?  Who are they?\n\n<b>                     1ST REPORTER\n</b>          Don't you know?  That's Wyatt\n          Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and\n          His lady fair.\n\nOutside, still bathed in shadows, Wyatt and Josephine hang \nonto the railing and lean out, watching in as the train nears \nthe top.\n\n<b>                     WYATT\n</b>          Get ready, here it comes!  Here it comes!\n\nThen, as if on cue, they crest the mountain and are suddenly \nbathed in golden sunlight, their heads leaning from the train, \nWyatt's blonde hair and Josephine's black tresses flowing in \nthe breeze, their faces luminous, looking straight ahead \ntoward their future.  Hold on this image as the sun gets \nbrighter and brighter, finally making the frame white-out as \nwe....\n\n<b>                                           FADE OUT:\n</b>\nEPILOG/DESERT : an OLD MAN and WOMAN walk arm-in-arm through \nthe Mojave, tiny figures in a vast landscape, Sierras looming \nin the distance.\n\n<b>                     V.O.
