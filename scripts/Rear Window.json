JEFFERIES' APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT\n</b>\n               Although we do not see the foreground window frame, we see \n               the whole background of a Greenwich Village street.\n\n               We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small \n               apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town \n               street, sharply etched by the morning sun.\n\n               Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked \n               roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood \n               and wrought iron in the construction.\n\n               The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do \n               not.\n\n               The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it \n               poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for \n               people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful \n               planning.\n\n               The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat.\n\n               It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted \n               blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a \n               sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within \n               earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned \n               to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring \n               each other, except on direct invitation.\n\n               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a \n               man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any \n               features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down \n               which a stream of sweat is running.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, \n               and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just \n               outside the window. It registers 84.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a \n               room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside \n               this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, \n               shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror \n               which he has set up on a shelf.\n\n               To the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top of \n               the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the \n               radio stops, and the announcer is heard.\n\n<b>                                     ANNOUNCER\n</b>                         The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. \n                         The temperature, outside, 84 -- \n                         Friends -- is your life worth one \n                         dollar?\n\n               The man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the \n               radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of \n               commercial voices until he again finds some music.\n\n               Contented, he returns to his shaving.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes \n               over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. \n               It goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor \n               bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm clock \n               hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A man \n               rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch the \n               alarm off.\n\n               We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his sitting \n               position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. To \n               our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- \n               rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in opposite \n               directions. They sit limply looking at each other with \n               bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed \n               very little sleep in the heat of the night.\n\n               THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another low \n               building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. Just \n               inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fan \n               sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it \n               is an automatic toaster.\n\n               Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman, \n               apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stomach, \n               navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below \n               her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep \n               shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders \n               and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She \n               takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends \n               over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker.\n\n               She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table \n               to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are \n               never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The \n               fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to \n               reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill \n               the exciting promise of her lack of clothes.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen between \n               two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, but a \n               Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersection \n               spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep \n               the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run behind \n               the truck, playing in the water.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the \n               side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from \n               one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage \n               which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the \n               cage are two lovebirds -- arguing.\n\n               THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through the \n               open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see more \n               of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to show a \n               head and shoulders of him.\n\n               He is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty five, \n               his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other \n               circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and \n               the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of \n               moral strength and basic honesty.\n\n               He is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a \n               plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of his \n               toes. Along the white cast someone has written \"Here lie the \n               broken bones of L. B. Jefferies.\"\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shattered \n               and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-action \n               news photographers.\n\n               On the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glossy \n               photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, \n               taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. \n               A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, \n               spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come off \n               the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly \n               into the camera lens.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall.\n\n               It is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having \n               caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy \n               artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle \n               outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a \n               solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. That \n               the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising \n               when the short distance between the camera and the explosion \n               is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner of \n               the picture reads -- \"L. B. Jefferies.\"\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line at \n               an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and police \n               are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot.\n\n               Clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist \n               with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their \n               feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic \n               observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and \n               real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight \n               surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same \n               signature, \"L. B. Jefferies,\" is in the corner.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a \n               beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at \n               Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violence. \n               The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some \n               spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through \n               binoculars.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cameras, \n               photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer on \n               which is resting a negative of a woman's head.\n\n               From this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and \n               although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see \n               the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we \n               have just passed.\n\n               THE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines -- \n               perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publication.\n\n<b>                                                           LAP DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE UP\n</b>\n               The screen is filled with the top of a desk. In addition to \n               the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent \n               feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger-\n               sized mat prints. Some of them have slips pasted over with \n               descriptions. The center of the desk is occupied by a large \n               layout of photographs on one magazine page. Behind this we \n               hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen \n               beyond the desk.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS UP and we are now face to face with IVAR \n               GUNNISON and JACK BRYCE. Gunnison is sitting on a window-\n               ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the New \n               York streets. Bryce leans against a wall at right angles to \n               him.\n\n               Gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. Bryce has a \n               cigarette in his mouth. He scratches a match, and is about \n               to light it, when he notices that Gunnison, still reading \n               the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and \n               produced a cigarette. Quickly, Bryce moves over to light \n               Gunnison's cigarette. Then he settles back to light his own. \n               Gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him.\n\n<b>                                     GUNNISON\n</b>                              (Looks up)\n                         Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would \n                         go sky-high.\n\n<b>                                     BRYCE\n</b>                         From the looks of Davidson's cable, \n                         it might even go higher than that. \n                         And we haven't even got a camera \n                         over there.\n\n<b>                                     GUNNISON\n</b>                              (Stands)\n                         This could go off in a month -- or \n                         an hour.\n\n<b>                                     BRYCE\n</b>                         I'll pull somebody out of Japan.\n\n<b>                                     GUNNISON\n</b>                              (Heads for his phone)\n                         Bryce, the only man for this job is \n                         sitting right here in town.\n                              (Picks up phone)\n                         Get me L.

Two pretty girls have appeared on the \n               distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot \n               hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their \n               backs to the CAMERA, they take off the robes, slipping them \n               down over their shoulders slowly. Then, seductively, they \n               turn -- revealing the full beauty of their tanned and bathing-\n               suited bodies.

With her feet still \n               moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving \n               back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, \n               occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. \n               She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the \n               room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter \n               nearby.\n\n               With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and \n               gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread.\n\n               She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her \n               interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter \n               and chicken leg.\n\n<b>               INT.

The short, \n               balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then \n               transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. \n               He continues this process, fighting the interference of the \n               ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful \n               and ear-catching.\n\n               It is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes \n               such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window \n               to look down toward the dancer's apartment.\n\n               He stands by a table at the window which is littered with \n               records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of \n               breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc.\n\n               He takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, \n               and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup.

He squirms, tries to move \n               the leg a little. It gives no relief. He scratches the outside \n               of the cast, but the itch gets worse. He reaches for a long, \n               Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, \n               and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. \n               He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his \n               face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces \n               it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the \n               scene outside the window.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He is easy to identify through \n               the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries \n               a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of \n               trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps \n               three feet square.\n\n               They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. \n               He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately \n               and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, \n               replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. \n               He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then \n               he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. \n               Finally, he waters them.\n\n<b>               INT.

She carries a copy of \n               the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She \n               settles into a folding, canvas deck chair.\n\n               Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of \n               emaciation. No sooner has she settled into her chair, than \n               she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his \n               garden. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over.

At \n               the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the \n               bedroom mirror. She gives a half turn and picks up a pair of \n               horn-rimmed glasses, which she puts on, and leans nearer to \n               her mirror. She picks up a lipstick and proceeds to paint \n               her lips carefully.\n\n               Having completed her make-up, she takes off her glasses and \n               surveys her face in the mirror. She stands up, swings the \n               skirt of her dress around, admires herself in the mirror. \n               She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively. \n               She lifts her chin, gives one last look, and turns toward \n               her living room. As if she's preparing to meet someone.\n\n<b>               INT.

She goes to \n               the door, opens it, and in pantomime admits an imaginary \n               caller. She pretends to kiss him lightly, take his hat, and \n               place the hat on a chair. Then she shows him to a seat at \n               the table, disappears into an unseen kitchen and returns \n               with a bottle and two glasses. She sits down, pours two \n               drinks. She lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man \n               opposite her.\n\n<b>               INT.

All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by \n               more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the \n               surroundings.\n\n               Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off \n               her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans \n               toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' \n               oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and \n               with an added personal touch for each guest. She is behaving \n               with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first \n               saw her in the morning. Her every movement is followed \n               admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black \n               tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- \n               a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and \n               last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be \n               from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. The latter \n               two are engaged in an animated conversation. The young man \n               in the grey suit is showing the other young man some newspaper \n               cuttings he's taken from his pocket.\n\n               Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is \n               empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill \n               it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual \n               glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she \n               makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, \n               and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the \n               time. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if \n               she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, \n               it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her \n               shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to \n               face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she \n               allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long \n               enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. \n               With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and \n               makes him rejoin the other two.\n\n<b>               INT.

She removes the screen in front of the \n               ice box, then opens the ice box.\n\n               She searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of \n               pumpkin pie. She closes the ice box. She starts to eat the \n               pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. Stopping \n               a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds \n               to take off her dress. Undoing the zippers, she slides it \n               over her head as she passes into the bathroom. The dress is \n               thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece \n               of pie. She is now in the bathroom. We see her slip down the \n               brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see \n               any lower. As she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few \n               pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush \n               rhythmically. She turns and moves down her bare back.\n\n<b>               INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP\n</b>\n               Jeff's eyes suddenly switch to the street.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He is in the act of laying out the mattress. \n               His wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl \n               type. Also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in \n               the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding \n               onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the \n               floor of the courtyard. Having been a one-time siffleuse, \n               her call to the dog is clarion and melodic.\n\n<b>               EXT.

For the first time we \n               see something of her activities inside the apartment. She \n               wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. She \n               is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. It takes \n               the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole \n               has been carved.\n\n               THE CAMERA MOVES ON much farther to the left, and eventually \n               comes to rest on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade \n               still drawn.\n\n               It MOVES ON and at last passes though Jeff's window, and \n               comes to rest on the two bid heads of Jeff and Lisa.\n\n               Her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks:\n\n<b>                                     LISA\n</b>                         How far does a girl have to go -- \n                         before you notice her?\n\n               Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window.\n\n<b>                                     JEFF\n</b>                         If she's pretty enough, she doesn't \n                         have to go anywhere.

She is wearing a Kelly Green \n               suit, and is seated at her dressing table.

She has faded good looks, \n               has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on \n               hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She \n               reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a \n               long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if \n               she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she \n               puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips \n               slightly.\n\n               She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out \n               the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the \n               drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight \n               for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and \n               tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of \n               determination.\n\n               She turns out the lights behind her.\n\n<b>               INT.

He is in black tie, and from the looks of the \n               apartment he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is \n               setting out trays of canap\u00e9s, glasses, ice and liquor. She \n               pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She \n               listens a moment to the songwriter's melody.

He is a tall flowing-haired \n               young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine \n               capacity.\n\n               They stop, at one point, to listen to a word of comment from \n               a woman who is watching.

She seems \n               to be trying to figure out what to do, or where to go. She \n               nervously looks at a couple of men passers by. Getting no \n               reaction, she crosses the street, and seats herself at an \n               empty table in front of the cafe. She orders a drink.\n\n               She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters \n               the picture from the left side. He is much nearer the lens, \n               because he is on this side of the street. He is, therefore, \n               slightly out of focus. The lens suddenly sharpens. It is \n               Thorwald, carrying a light-weight cardboard box under his \n               arm. THE CAMERA PANS him over to the right until he is lost \n               behind the building.\n\n<b>               INT.

Then sharpening \n               his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself \n               back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald.\n\n<b>               EXT.

He enters \n               the apartment turns on the living room lights.\n\n               He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there.\n\n               A number of suits and top coats are lying on an orderly pile \n               on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts in \n               on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, \n               and instead of putting the laundry away,\n\n               he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers -- \n               pajamas, shirts, sox, etc. He piles these on the beds.\n\n<b>               INT.

We have previously \n               seen this handbag hanging from the bedpost when Mrs. Thorwald \n               was in bed.

He picks up the open alligator \n               handbag. He turns, facing the window, looking down at the \n               bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then \n               suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little \n               further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa \n               who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He \n               holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question \n               the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his \n               head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to \n               emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her \n               gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a \n               lame excuse for being found in his apartment.\n\n               He comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. \n               Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently \n               argues with him as to the way she came in.\n\n               He points to the window. She makes one more step toward the \n               door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the \n               wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into \n               the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the \n               head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across \n               the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands \n               something from Lisa.\n\n               Slowly her right hand comes up and opens.\n\n               He takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised \n               moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with \n               both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is \n               talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out \n               faintly: \"Jeff! Jeff!\"\n\n               Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes \n               that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the \n               room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The \n               faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but \n               not clearly.\n\n<b>               INT.

They stop at the door, listen a \n               moment, and then push the buzzer insistently. Inside the \n               apartment, lights go on, and Thorwald is in the center of \n               the room looking toward the door. Lisa staggers away from \n               him, trying to rearrange her clothes and her hair. She is as \n               surprised at the interruption as Thorwald.

He completes his turn \n               and is looking at the girl a little puzzled. He then swings \n               back toward the police.\n\n<b>               INT.

Thorwald, listening, comes \n               quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. He holds out \n               the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the \n               empty handbag.

Both in dress and manner she \n               seems quite happy and adjusted to life. The songwriter is \n               placing the first recording of his new song on a record player \n               for her to hear. It is a full symphonic arrangement which is \n               heard over. \n\n<b>               CONTINUE TO PAN\n</b>\n               Thorwald's apartment is empty, stripped of its furnishings. \n               Two painters are repainting the walls.\n\n               The siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, \n               training a new white dog to ride in their basket.\n\n               Miss Torso is practicing her ballet again. She wears a white \n               leotard. The sound of someone at the door interrupts her. \n               She goes to the door, opens it an inch or two cautiously. \n               When she sees who is outside, she throws open the door. An \n               innocuous, unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters \n               with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder. She kisses him \n               fondly after closing the door. He puts down the barracks \n               bag, tosses his hat into a chair and, with the attitude of a \n               man who belongs there, goes to the icebox to see what's to \n               eat.\n\n               The newlyweds are arguing.\n\n               The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair \n               facing away from the window.

The CAMERA LIFTS SLIGHTLY to show Lisa sitting on the \n               sofa nearby. She wears Levis and a plaid cotton shirt. She \n               is reading a book on travel. She looks up briefly at Jeff. \n               When she realizes he is asleep, she puts down the travel \n               book and reaches for the latest copy of Harper's Bazaar.
