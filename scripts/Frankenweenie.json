CLASS - DAY\r\n\r\nBack at school Victor is despondent. Unable to\r\nconcentrate, he doodles pictures of Sparky in his\r\nnotebook and barely listens to the lecture.\r\n\r\n                         MR. RZYKRUSKI\r\n           Just like lightning, the nervous\r\n           system is electricity.\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            January 2012\r\n                 Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   18\r\n\r\n                        MR.

You are standing in\r\n          the fire!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ryzkruski lifts up a plate with a cloth on. He\r\nreveals a dead frog.\r\n\r\n                          CHILDREN\r\n          Eww!\r\n\r\n                        MR. RZYKRUSKI\r\n          Even after death, the wiring\r\n          remains. Watch as the muscles\r\n          respond to the electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Ryzkruski places the frog onto his desk and begins to\r\nhook an electrode to its leg.\r\n\r\nThe wiring is attached to a small box that can generate\r\nan electric charge.\r\n\r\nMr Ryzkruski now attaches the electrode to the frog's leg\r\nand, with a flip of a switch, turns on the electricity -\r\n\r\nThe frog leg jumps up as if alive!\r\n\r\nAnd so does Victor.\r\n\r\nHe looks back and forth between Mr. Ryzkruski's\r\ndemonstration and his doodle of Sparky. An idea.\r\n\r\nVictor bursts out of the school doors and starts to run\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY\r\n\r\nVictor runs through the street on his way home.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nHe runs into the garage and grabs a whole lot of tools,\r\ngear and equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. VICTOR'S HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nVictor raids the kitchen for some household appliances.\r\nMom sits on the couch reading and only barely registers\r\nwhat he is up to.\r\n\r\n                        MOM\r\n          Hi Victor, how was school?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           January 2012\r\n                  Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2   19\r\n\r\n\r\n                           VICTOR\r\n          Ok.\r\n\r\nVictor heads upstairs with a box of the appliances he has\r\njust collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. PET CEMETERY - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA full moon.    HOOTING owls.\r\n\r\nOver the top of the fence, we see a shovel blade moving\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThe shovel digs into the soft earth.   Again.   And again.\r\n\r\nVictor is digging up Sparky's grave. It's tough work,\r\nespecially because he's trying to be quiet.\r\n\r\nA black cat perches on a nearby gravestone.     SCREECHES.\r\n\r\nSpooked, Victor waves him off.\r\n\r\nHe's uncovered the box. He opens it and gingerly loads\r\nthe wrapped bundle into shoulder.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nVictor's parents are sitting on the couch watching a\r\nmovie. Though the movie isn't really scary, Mom looks for\r\nany excuse to snuggle closer to her husband. He\r\nplayfully encourages it and puts his arm around her to\r\npull her closer.\r\n\r\nAs Victor sneaks behind them, carrying the wrapped\r\ncorpse, he inadvertently knocks into a lamp causing it to\r\nflicker.\r\n\r\nDad turns and sees what's back there but can't see Victor\r\nwho is hiding, frozen, just out of sight.\r\n\r\nDad turns back to the TV.\r\n\r\nRelieved, Victor tiptoes past them, heading for the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT\r\n\r\nEXTREMELY CLOSE ON the eye of a needle.   Thread pushes\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nVictor is making repairs to Sparky's corpse. We don't\r\nsee any of it directly, just shadows on the wall.\r\n\r\nHe rummages through a bucket of nuts and screws, picking\r\ntwo oversized bolts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                            January 2012\r\n                Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2     20\r\n\r\n\r\nHe places Sparky onto Mom's ironing board and pushes it\r\ndirectly under the skylight. The storm is just reaching a\r\nfever pitch.\r\n\r\nAs HOPEFUL MUSIC rises, Victor climbs a ladder out the\r\nwindow where we see that he has attached his metal swing\r\nset to the roof. Victor checks the wind direction and\r\nlets fly two balloons attached to the umbrella and\r\nfastens the ends to the swing set. This will serve as the\r\nconductor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. BURGEMEISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nBurgemeister is drawing his drapes shut when he sees the\r\nmovement on the Frankenstein roof. He can't make out\r\nVictor, but it's enough to make him suspicious.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. ATTIC LABORATORY - NIGHT\r\n\r\nVictor climbs down and checks his notes and his\r\nequipment.\r\n\r\nWe see a whole host of household items that Victor has re-\r\npurposed to become part of his elaborate apparatus.\r\n\r\n- A series of Mom's colanders and pans and appliances,\r\n\r\n- an old fish tank,\r\n\r\n- some bobbing Christmas reindeer\r\n\r\nall serve as unlikely components of his grand experiment.\r\n\r\nHe has also erected a series of pulleys so that he can\r\nhoist Sparky up through the sky light.\r\n\r\nVictor can hear the storm raging and knows that it is now\r\nor never. He pets Sparky's lifeless form one last time\r\nfor courage.\r\n\r\nHe turns to an old Schwinn bicycle mounted on a stand and\r\nstarts the wheels spinning. One by one the appliances\r\nstart to whir and come alive.\r\n\r\nVictor then begins to hoist Sparky up through the sky\r\nlight. The rain is beating down and the lightning is\r\ngetting more intense.\r\n\r\nThe metal table finally reaches his resting spot under\r\nthe swing set.\r\n\r\nNow all he can do is wait. He watches the storm intently,\r\nsilently urging Zeus' thunderbolts to strike.\r\n\r\nAnd then...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          January 2012\r\n                Final Shooting Script_2012_01_18_v2      21\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACK!\r\n\r\nA jagged finger of light touches the top of the balloons,\r\nracing down the cord and into the attic -\r\n\r\nZapping Sparky with a thousand volts.\r\n\r\nVictor removes his goggles, and springs right to action\r\ncranking down the metal table, eager to see if it worked.\r\n\r\nAll of the appliances power down and grind to a halt. The\r\nroom goes silent.\r\n\r\nHe swings the table over to the workbench.\r\n\r\nWearing a stethoscope, he listens for a heartbeat.\r\nHearing nothing, he keeps checking. But he eventually\r\nrealizes it has all been for naught.\r\n\r\nHe lays his head down on the workbench, letting out\r\nexhausted, sniffly tears.\r\n\r\n                        VICTOR\r\n          I'm sorry, boy.\r\n\r\nA beat.\r\n\r\nAs a single tear drips onto Sparky's lifeless form, we\r\nhear a final spark and then...\r\n\r\nHis TAIL starts to move and   -\r\n\r\nHis TONGUE licks Victor face.\r\n\r\nVictor sits up, bewildered.   It's Sparky, still half-\r\nwrapped in the blanket.\r\n\r\n                        VICTOR\r\n          You're alive! You're alive!\r\n          Sparky! You're Alive! I can't\r\n          believe it you're alive!\r\n\r\nSparky can't control how happy he is and knocks Victor to\r\nthe group. He enthusiastically licks his face and wags\r\nhis tail so excitedly that it flies clear across the\r\nroom. For a moment, he looks worried but Victor just\r\nlaughs.\r\n\r\n                        VICTOR\r\n          I can fix that.\r\n\r\nVictor and Sparky play on the attic floor excited to be\r\nback together.\r\n\r\n                        VICTOR\r\n          It worked.
