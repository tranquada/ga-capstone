Jack would fly\n\t\tinto North Carolina, we'd meet him there\n\t\tand drive it down to different\n\t\tdistribution points...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tI never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego\n\t\tDelgado was my only connection to\n\t\tcocaine from Colombia...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tDiego convinced me to keep most of my\n\t\tmoney in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a\n\t\tclose relationship with Manuel Noriega.\n\t\tIn exchange for allowing us to keep our\n\t\tmoney there, we paid him a percentage.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThere was an 85% chance that if you\n\t\tsnorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it\n\t\twas ours. Initially with my LA\n\t\tconnections, we invented the\n\t\tmarketplace.  In 1977, there was no\n\t\tother real competition.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tThe first year we made about 100 million\n\t\tdollars between us.  It was an expensive\n\t\toperation.  Eventually we built up to\n\t\tthree different pilots doing multiple\n\t\truns per week, connections on both\n\t\tcoasts, everything was running smooth.\n\t\tWe were like a corporation...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\the was very anti-government.  He talked\n\t\tabout revolution, forming his own\n\t\tcountry or island, he was looking for\n\t\tpower as well as money.  I was just\n\t\tlooking for money.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tHe disliked the United States, thought\n\t\tit was a police state.  He hoped that by\n\t\tflooding the country with cocaine, it\n\t\twould disrupt the political system and\n\t\ttear down the morality of the country.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tWell, yes, Derek Foreal was my\n\t\tconnection, I met him back in 1968 when\n\t\tI first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It\n\t\twas Foreal's marijuana connections that\n\t\tkicked off our cocaine market.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tYes, it was my idea to bring the kilos\n\t\tto Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got\n\t\tDerek Foreal's name from me, it was only\n\t\ta matter of months before he'd cut me\n\t\tout.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\tI'm not sure how my relationship with my\n\t\tdaughter and ex-wife have anything to do\n\t\twith this trial.

No more questions.\n\n\tSilence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos\n\tlaughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks\n\tby Diego.  They look at each other.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n</b>\t\tYou shouldn't have taken the 30 million,\n\t\tDiego, I was out.\n\n\tGeorge is lead away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCLERK\n</b>\t\tThe court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.\n\n\tJack Stevens is lead to the stand.
