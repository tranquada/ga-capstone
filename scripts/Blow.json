From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.\n\tHe is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves\n\tquickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And\n\tthen, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.\n\tGeorge and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is\n\thanded a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his\n\thands, as he moves back.\n\n\t\t\t\tLARGE COLOMBIAN MAN\n\t\tHe will see you now.\n\t\t    (to Diego)\n\t\tNot you.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\t\tThere must be some kind of mistake.\n\n\t\t\t\tLARGE COLOMBIAN MAN\n\t\tNo mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.\n\t\tJung alone.  You are to wait here.\n\n\tGeorge hesitates.\n\n\t\t\t\tDIEGO\n\t\tIt's alright, George.  You go.\n\n\t\t\t\tLARGE COLOMBIAN MAN\n\t\tThis way, please.\n\n\tThe large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where\n\tthe maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he\n\tis led away.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tSo, this is the man who takes fifty\n\t\tkilos and makes them disappear in one\n\t\tday?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tActually, it was three.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tThe man who gives us the airplanes.  The\n\t\tman from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.\n\t\tBoom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to\n\t\topen for us the gates of Hollywood,\n\t\tGeorge?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tIt would be my pleasure.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tGood.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.\n\t\tWelcome to my country.\n\n\tEscobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and\n\ttheir hands come together.  George can't help it.  He\n\treflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR (CONT'D)\n\t\tThe man in the garden.  He was full of\n\t\tcourage.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tUn sapo?\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tUn rata - no good.  But he could have\n\t\trun, fled the country.  Gone to the\n\t\tpolicia.  But then his wife, his\n\t\tchildren, his parents, his friends, many\n\t\tpeople would die.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tBut, never mind.  I am thinking we can\n\t\tdo much together.  This problem with\n\t\tDiego, the stolen car, the jail, is very\n\t\tsilly business.  To release him from the\n\t\tcarcel, it causes me much inconvenience.\n\t\tThe fifty kilos could have been a big\n\t\tproblem.  And I don't like problems.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tWith all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my\n\t\tpartner.  I do not do business without\n\t\thim.\n\n\tEscobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't\n\tflinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks\n\tacross Pablo's lips.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tI like you, George.  You are loyal.\n\t\tThat is good.  That is rare.  Maybe\n\t\tcrazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You\n\t\tare like me.  I look at you and I see\n\t\tmyself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tYes, it is.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tSo, you are wanting to sell the cocaine\n\t\tfor me in your country, George?\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tYes, sir.  As much as you can give me.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tAs much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very\n\t\tgood.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let\n\t\tus drive.  We have much to talk about.\n\n\tDiego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an\n\tarm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and\n\tmotions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo\n\twaves them away.\n\n\tEXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY\n\n\tEscobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.

What do you think, George?\n\n\tEscobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to\n\trespond in full.\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE\n\t\tWhat do I think?  I don't want my answer\n\t\tto be influenced by what I want, so I'm\n\t\tgoing to have to say I don't know.\n\n\t\t\t\tESCOBAR\n\t\tYes.  I do not know, either.

Jack would fly\n\t\tinto North Carolina, we'd meet him there\n\t\tand drive it down to different\n\t\tdistribution points...\n\n\t\t\t\tGEORGE (CONT'D)\n\t\tI never met Pablo Escobar.
