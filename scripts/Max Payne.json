The crib\n          tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.\n          \n          Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING\n          into the glass.

STREET (NYC) - NIGHT\n          \n          Abruptly, the snow is gone. Just a bitter wind left in its\n          place, whipping through desolate streets long after midnight.\n          Shuffling up the littered sidewalk, three rough-looking MEN\n          duck out of the wind by descending down to the subway...\n          \n          On the dark side of the street, a pair of BOOTS follows them.\n          \n          TITLE CARD:      ONE WEEK EARLIER\n          \n          INT. ROSCOE ST. STATION - DAY\n          \n          A filthy platform, empty except for the three Men huddled on\n          a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...\n          \n          The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the\n          walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold\n          wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls\n          back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...\n          \n          The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked\n          `MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.\n          \n          SUBWAY BATHROOM\n          \n          The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious\n          prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the\n          edge of the sink before washing his hands...\n          \n                                 MAN #1\n                       Hey, that's a really nice watch.\n          \n          No answer. One of the Men LOCKS the door.       At the sound of\n          the lock SNAPPING, he raises his head...\n          \n          Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the\n          river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.\n          In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer...\n          \n                                 MAN #1\n                           (drooling over the watch)\n                       Kinda reminds me of one I lost--\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       You didn't lose it.

The third man - not much more than a\n          KID, visibly frightened - backs towards the door.\n          \n                                                      \n          \n                                                                     4.\n                     \n          \n          \n                                 PAWNSHOP\n                       You a cop, or something?\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       Not tonight.\n          \n                                 PAWNSHOP\n                       Too bad.\n                           (to Doug)\n                       Go get my watch.\n          \n          Distractedly eyeballing Max, Doug brushes the watch off of\n          the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.\n          \n          In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,\n          the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...\n          \n          Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as\n          Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he\n          races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.\n          \n          In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to\n          pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...\n          \n          In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky\n          floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the\n          pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall.\n          \n                                 DOUG\n                         (craving, eyes closed)\n                       Watch over me, watch over me...\n          \n          The newly-perforated door flies open.

Max\n          reaches into his pocket and produces a tattered photograph...\n          It's the woman from Max's golden vision in the river.\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       Have you ever seen her before?\n          \n          Doug shakes his head violently, confusion and terror rising.\n          \n                                 MAX\n                       You got busted robbing a house in New\n                       Jersey with William Preston three--\n          \n                               DOUG\n                     Bill's dead.\n          \n                               MAX\n                     That's why I'm talking to you.\n                         (moving the photo closer)\n                     Did he ever say anything about this\n                     woman?

Max steps in, reaching up to touch Mona's shoulder...\n          I\n           t happens in a flash: Mona spins and takes hold of Max's\n          arm. Incredibly, he's just as fast, slipping free of the\n          grip that would surely have snapped his wrist...\n          \n          For a moment, Max and Mona stare each other down. Surprised,\n          reevaluating each other. Natasha continues to TALK, her\n          Russian anxious as Mona's bodyguards push through the crowd.\n          \n          Mona's eyes drop to Max's chest, where the tussle pulled his\n          coat open to reveal a low-pro holster and tarnished badge.\n          \n          With the flick of her wrist, Mona stops her guards' advance.\n          \n          The crowd begins to notice the altercation.

Silly grin, frozen eyes shining.\n          \n          Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the\n          box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light...\n          \n          The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely\n          smiling.

Max\n          chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box.\n          \n           he beam hits on a document box in the back row.   `OFFICE.'\n          \n          Max rushes over, nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry\n          to throw the lid off the document box.

Stone-faced.\n          \n          Thundering BOOTS echo out from the belly of the building.\n          Doors fly open - Guards racing out from the kitchen on the\n          first floor, two more from the office CRASHING out upstairs.\n          \n           ax OPENS UP, flames of automatic fire lighting his way.\n          \n          BACK ROOM\n          \n          Lupino and the Guards listen to the SHOOTING grow closer.\n          Suddenly, the metal door flies open, BANGING at the stop.\n          With lightning reflexes, THE GUARDS BLAST down the hallway.\n          \n           upino slowly stands, eyes glowing in the guard's muzzle\n          flash.

Before he sees\n          it coming, Lupino drives a hard punch into Max's skull.\n          \n          Max stumbles forward, ears ringing from the blow.

Teeth gnashing like an animal, Lupino reaches out\n          and tries to pull the machine gun out of Max's hands.\n          \n           upino buries the knife into Max's shoulder.

Arm numb from the\n          stab wound, Max's grip on the gun is slowly overpowered.\n          Helplessly watching it slip away, Max SCREAMS with rage...\n          E\n           XT.

Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the\n          walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead\n          GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves:\n          \n          \n          \n          Max.

No\n          chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of\n          machine gun fire.

A thin trail\n          of blood follows behind him in the snow...\n          \n          BB watches Max's approach, his swagger rapidly failing.\n          \n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                 BB\n                       Just get to it, already. That's all I\n                       ask. You've earned it, so just...\n          \n          With the pain in his stomach causing some difficulty, Max\n          pulls the pistol's slide back to check for a live round.\n          \n          BB watches Max's preparations, terror growing. Unable to\n          resist his panic, BB abruptly tries on a helpless smile.\n          \n                                 BB\n                       But I want you to listen to me, first.\n                       Just try to hear what--\n          \n          Max raises the pistol and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The slug hits\n          BB in the center of the forehead, snapping his neck back.\n          \n          The shell casing twirls down, landing in the snow without a\n          sound. BB's corpse lands a moment later with a clumsy THUD.\n          \n          Max lets the gun slip out of his hand and walks past the body\n          - BB's eyes frozen on the sky, red halo slowly expanding.\n          \n          Max reaches the edge, the river's black body revealed below.\n          His gait falters, blood filling each footprint in the snow...\n          \n          INT.

A stiff wind buffets against\n          his chest, forcing his unsteady legs to sway a little.\n          \n          Slowly, his eyes drift from the water below to the sky...\n          \n                                                                CUT TO:\n          \n          INT.
