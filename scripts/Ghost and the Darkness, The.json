Still moving forward.\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\nPATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a \nbranch, lands hard and\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\nTHE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now \nfour, now-\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\nPATTERSON, helpless on the ground.\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\nTHE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-\n\n-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge \nteeth into the branch-\n\n-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.\n\n<b>CUT TO\n</b>\nPATTERSON.
