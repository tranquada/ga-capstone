The figure gets \nlarger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or \nwhere we are.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tThis is the most famous true story\n\t\tof Africa. It happened a hundred\n\t\tyears ago, but even now, when\n\t\tchildren ask about it, you do not\n\t\ttell them at night.\n\t\t\t(The FIGURE continues \n\t\t\tto grow)\n\t\tIt began with the race to build a\n\t\trailroad across Africa.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut this is not about building a\n\t\trailroad- it is about Patterson.\n\nAnd now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT \nCOLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious, \nserious about his life, serious about his career. He has been \nsuccessful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his \ntalents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.\n\nAND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.\n\nMore specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant \nbuilding - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat, \neverything is clean and in order.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tPatterson was thirty. A brilliant\n\t\tengineer. A fine man, but do not\n\t\tbecome attached to him- there are\n\t\tmany fine men in this story but do\n\t\tnot become attached to any of them.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tSo many of them die.\n\nPatterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.\n\n\t\t\t\tMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tAnd remember this: only the\n\t\timpossible parts of what follows\n\t\treally happened...\n\t\t\t(Now the door opens\n\t\t\tand we-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nJust a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is \nROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his \noffice and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are \nmaps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\t\t(The great smile flashes)\n\t\tJohn Henry Patterson, come in. I'm\n\t\tRobert Beaumont.\n\t\t\t(They shake hands)\n\t\tFirm- I like that, tells me a lot\n\t\tabout you-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-now why don't you tell me about me?\n\t\tTo get you started, many people find\n\t\tme handsome, with a wonderful smile.\n\t\tI'm sure you agree.\n\t\t\t(Surprised, uncomfortable,\n\t\t\tPatterson nods)\n\t\tWinning personality, heaps of charm?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tMy wife is the game player in the\n\t\tfamily, sir.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tGames?\n\t\t\t(staring dead at Patterson)\n\t\tLook at me closely, Patterson: I am\n\t\ta monster.

Beaumont turns \nsharply and moves to a large map.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear \nline that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\t\t(pointing along the line)\n\t\tWe are building this railroad\n\t\tacross Africa for the glorious\n\t\tpurpose of saving Africa from the\n\t\tAfricans.

We are ahead,\n\t\tand we will stay ahead providing\n\t\tyou do what I hired you to do-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at \"Tsavo,\" 130 miles in.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\t-build the bridge over the Tsavo\n\t\triver. And be finished in four\n\t\tmonths time. Can you do that?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'm sure you've examined my record.\n\t\tSo you know I've never yet been\n\t\tlate on a bridge.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tYou've never built in Africa.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tBut I have in India- every country\n\t\tpresents problems.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tYou'll need your confidence, I\n\t\tpromise you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI've got a reason far beyond\n\t\tconfidence: my wife is having our\n\t\tfirstborn in five months and I\n\t\tpromised I'd be with her when the\n\t\tbaby comes.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tVery moving, Patterson; I'm touched\n\t\tyou confided in me.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut I don't really give a shit about\n\t\tyour upcoming litter. I've made you\n\t\twith this assignment-\n\t\t\t(the smile)\n\t\t-don't make me break you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(smiling right back)\n\t\tYou won't have the chance.\n\t\t\t(glancing at his watch)\n\t\tAny further words of encouragement?\n\t\t\t(silence)\n\t\tThen I've a train to catch.\n\nThey look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear \nthey do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER\n\nA train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise. \nPatterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the \nkind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not \nbegun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into \nhis arms.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tI tried to be late, John- it would\n\t\thave been easier if you'd gone.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(They are nutty about\n\t\t\teach other - he nods)\n\t\tWe're not much good at goodbyes, \n\t\tHelena.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\t\t(brightly)\n\t\tTell me about Beaumont- does he\n\t\tunderstand how brilliant you are,\n\t\thow lucky he is to have you?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tIt was embarrassing- the man showered\n\t\tme with compliments.\n\nThey start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a \nquieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tOh dear-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-you're geting that downtrodden look\n\t\tagain-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t-well, it's just...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t...other men don't abandon their wives\n\t\tat such a time-\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\t\t(not unkindly)\n\t\t-oh please- if I'd been against your\n\t\ttaking this, you would have abandoned\n\t\tme. You've been desperate to see Africa\n\t\tyour whole life.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhat if there are complications?-\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\t-not \"what if\"- there will be, there\n\t\talways are. Which only means that our\n\t\t\"son\" and I- note my confidence- will\n\t\thave an excuse to come visit.\n\nTHE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tGo, now.\n\t\t\t(He kisses her hand)\n\t\tSuch a gentleman.\n\t\t\t(Now he holds her)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI am desperate to see Africa- but I\n\t\thate the leaving.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA. She hates it, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tYou build bridges, John-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-you've got to go where the rivers are.\n\nThey hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into \neach other's arms a final time, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-\n\n-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.\n\nHOLD FOR A MOMENT.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nPatterson runs out of the steam and we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nA DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.\n\nThis is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine \nseat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad \ninspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece \nof wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.\n\nCUT TO\n\nNIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train, \ntrying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.\n\nSTARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him \nwell, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that \nshirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends \nnonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man, \nmorally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian \ntimes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(as Patterson helps\n\t\t\thim aboard)\n\t\tMany thanks.\n\t\t\t(squints)\n\t\tYou're Patterson, yes?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tNigel Starling- I'll be assisting you\n\t\tat Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must\n\t\thave told you that.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHe just gave me his \"monster\" speech.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tThat. I know Robert seems dreadful, \n\t\tbut when you truly get to know the man,\n\t\twell, he's much worse.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd I'm one of his defenders.\n\t\t\t(Patterson smiles)\n\t\tForget him for now- it's your first\n\t\tride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it\n\t\tbreathtaking.\n\t\t\t(And on that word-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked \nwith dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary \ndesert.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shouting toward Starling)\n\t\t\"Breathtaking\" doesn't begin to do it\n\t\tjustice.\n\t\t\t(As Starling starts to\n\t\t\tlaugh, his mouth opens\n\t\t\tand sand flies in, and\n\t\t\this coughing fit returns\n\t\t\tand)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust \ngets worse- a wind has kicked up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.\n\nPatterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping \nto push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers \nspread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs \nall the assistance it can get.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.\n\nPatterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded \noff. Patterson has a book open in his lap-\n\n-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that \naccurate.\n\nNow Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.\n\nStokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.\n\nHe stares out-\n\n-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And \nnow, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first \nview of the Africa of his imagination.\n\nBecause the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees \nand one more thing-\n\n-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.\n\nA flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing \nthere amazing leap there.\n\nPatterson is like a kid in a candy store.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again. \nStarling points-\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tAren't they amazing?\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd \nshape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly \nlong strides.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou know the most amazing thing\n\t\tabout them?- they only sleep five\n\t\tminutes a day.\n\t\t\t(Starling glances at him-\n\t\t\tclearly, he didn't know that)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tDon't much like them.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tThe females are bigger- only animal\n\t\there like that- have to be or they\n\t\twouldn't survive because the males\n\t\teat the young.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tAnything special about them?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tJust that they fart through their\n\t\tmouths.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tMust make kissing something of a\n\t\tgamble.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tI've lived in Africa a year and I\n\t\tdon't know what you know. How long\n\t\thave you been here?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(looks at his watch)\n\t\tAlmost three hours.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut I've been getting ready all my\n\t\tlife.\n\t\t\t(Now, from them-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children \nwho wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished \nlooking than their mothers.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(suddenly touched)\n\t\tEvery time I see something like that,\n\t\tI know we're right to be here- to\n\t\tbring Christianity into their lives,\n\t\tenrich their souls.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tBeaumont says it's to end slavery.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tWe all have our reasons. Mine is \n\t\tsimply to make them understand \n\t\thappiness, accept salvation, know the \n\t\tserenity that comes-\n\t\t\t(interrupts himself)\n\t\t-best I stop. One of the by-products \n\t\tof my belief is that I can become \n\t\tamazingly boring. But I know God smiles \n\t\ton me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(They really like each other)\n\t\tHave you got that in writing?\n\t\t\t(Starling, amazingly good\n\t\t\tnatured, laughs. And now-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA WHITE CLAW.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nHundreds of white claws.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL\n\nThey aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and \nthey're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.\n\nAnd there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in \nwith other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked \nred rocks-\n\n-now the train begins to slow.\n\nSmoke drifts across.\n\nA bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING (over)\n\t\tWelcome to Tsavo.\n\t\t\t(on the word)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTSAVO.\n\nWe have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a \nplace that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water \ntower is under construction-\n\n-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for \nwork.\n\nTHE TRAIN goes slower still.\n\nNo one stands idly around here.\n\nBut no one looks happy either.\n\nONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.\n\nAn ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light \nthe world.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(indicating Samuel,\n\t\t\twho is approaching)\n\t\tSamuel is camp liaison- absolutely\n\t\tindispensable- the only man here\n\t\teveryone trusts.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tDoes he speak English?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(not softly enough)\n\t\tAnd very poor French.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(introducing)\n\t\tSamuel- John Patterson.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(as they shake)\n\t\tThe bridgebuilder-\n\t\t\t(gesturing to the \n\t\t\tworking men)\n\t\t-we have been getting ready for \n\t\tyou.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tExcellent. Could I see the bridge\n\t\tsite?\n\t\t\t(Samuel nods)\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tI've got medical supplies to\n\t\tdeliver. Come along to the hospital\n\t\twhen you're done.\n\t\t\t(starting off)\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tI will bring him, Nigel.\n\nWe should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at \nthe very beginning of the picture.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.\n\nStanding on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely \npowerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.\n\nWORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead, \nsome SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhy do the workers look unhappy?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tBecause they are here.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBecause Tsavo is the worst place in\n\t\tthe world.\n\t\t\t(He points ahead)\n\t\tCome, John- to the bridge.\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.\n\nAnd here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot \nwhere the movie takes place was like.\n\nThere were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived \nin a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have \ncome from the same town back in their country might choose to live \nin one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another \ncluster.\n\nWhat we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are \ndozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began, \nthese areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)\n\nThe places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's \nliving area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where \nthe bridge is to be built, etc., etc.\n\nAs they move, Samuel points out various camps.\n\nA SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.\n\nANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.\n\nA GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.\n\nAnyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a \nwide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.\n\nOkay, back to the story.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(as they pass the INDIAN\n\t\t\ttent area where prayer is\n\t\t\tstarting)\n\t\tIt's all wonderfully under control,\n\t\tSamuel- you've done a splendid job.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThank you. The truth is this: you\n\t\thave to work at it constantly.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThe workers don't get on?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tGet on? They detest each other.\n\t\tObviously the Africans hate the\n\t\tIndians. But the Indians also hate\n\t\tthe other Indians. Some of them\n\t\tworship cows, while others eat them.\n\t\t\t(As they move on)\n\nCUT TO\n\nRAILROAD TRACK.\n\nPAN ALONG TO\n\nMORE RAILROAD TRACK.\n\nKEEP PANNING\n\nAnd suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The \ntrack has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where \nit just stops-\n\n-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words, \nis the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of \ntrack.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(to the far side)\n\t\tRailhead is across there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great \nclouds of dust.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThree thousand men laying track- when\n\t\tthe bridge is done, it all joins up.\n\nPatterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at \nthe space where the bridge is to be.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tDid it look like this in your mind?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tThis is more difficult-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(eyes bright)\n\t\t-but how wonderful that it's \n\t\tdifficult, it should be difficult- \n\t\twhat better job in all the world\n\t\tthan build a bridge?- make things\n\t\tconnect- bring worlds together- and\n\t\tget it right!\n\t\t\t(Now from Patterson-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOSPITAL TENT\n\nas Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-\n\n-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured \nor with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen, \neverything is working well, everything is under control. Starling \napproaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tFinish your tour?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(nods)\n\t\tAnd anxious to get started.\n\t\t\t(indicating the hospital)\n\t\tWhat is this, mostly malaria?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tYes- but their suffering is only\n\t\ttransitory- once they except God\n\t\tinto their hearts, He will vanquish\n\t\tall pain.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN'S VOICE (over)\n\t\tThat's just vomitous talk, Nigel- the\n\t\tpoor bastards will relapse if you keep\n\t\ton that way.\n\t\t\t(As they turn-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nDOCTOR DAVID HAWTHORNE. A tough, middle-aged cockney. And a heavy \ndrinker. A man who hasn't been tactful in twenty years.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\t\t(to Patterson)\n\t\tI'm David Hawthorne, this is my\n\t\thospital.

Around it, the wind \nmakes different shapes of the grass.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at \nthe spot where the pattern stopped.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to \nshiver, as if from cold.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BUILDING SEQUENCE\n\nAnd what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.\n\nHuge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and \ndriven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.\n\nAnd Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as \nthe structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in \nthe air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.\n\nAnd alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with \nglasses and very bright eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that \nis on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to \nhelp on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the \nclumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with \nit, does well.\n\nAnd Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but \nmostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the \nplacements of the three stone foundation pillars-\n\n-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in- \nand at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the \nstart of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-\n\n-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-\n\n-which is all he wears from now on.\n\nAnd the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going, \nworking with the power of three-\n\n-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and \nHawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-\n\n-it's hard, brutal work-\n\n-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge \nskeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work \non the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three \nfoundation pillars are taking shape-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to \ncomplete the embankments. As this goes on-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is \ngoing very quickly.\n\nPatterson stops working, looks across the river-\n\n-movement in the grassy area on the far side.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to \nSamuel who gestures back.

It's kind of become their password.\n\nHOLD. A big moment for them all!\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH'S TENT AREA\n\nHe sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate \nis beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA\n\nStarling is there, getting ready for bed.

KEEP ON HOLDING.\n\nAnd now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-\n\n-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by \nsome giant invisible wire-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSINGH. CLOSE UP.

They are not \n\t\t\tfriends. Now-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THORN BUSHES WE SAW ON OUR ARRIVAL TO TSAVO\n\nENDLESS NUMBERS OF THEM. There is a machete-like sound as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA BUNCH OF WORKMEN, led by Samuel, chopping down branches. They do \nit with care- these are claws-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-STARLING, in charge of another area, and he's not hanging back, \nhe's taking less care than the others, hacking away with his \nmachete, moving in between bushes and\n\nCUT TO\n\nONE OF THE BUSHES, SNAPPING BACK into Starling, and Starling \ntaking the blow with his arms- the claws cut his clothing-\n\n-his arms are starting to bleed-\n\n-he is unmindful, continues to wade into the bushes, chopping at \nthem, cutting them down. He is a good man doing a good thing and \nright now, he is possessed.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, leaving his tent area, lost in thought, going toward \nthe bridge. Up ahead is a grassy area.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GRASSY AREA\n\nFor a moment, nothing. Then there is the same kind of movement we \nsaw with Singh. Something is making the grass move-\n\n-only now there is no wind... HOLD.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Did he see it? We'll never know.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, in charge of a thorn fence that is halfway finished. His \nclothes are shredded. A WORKER has finished with a section and \nsatisfied, moves on-\n\n-but Starling is far from finished. He grabs the thorns with his \nbare hands and squeezes them together.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tNot good enough- look, it's got to\n\t\tbe tighter. Tighter.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA IN WHICH HE'S BEEN WORKING. FENCES ARE WELL ALONG TOWARD \nCOMPLETION. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON.\n\nPULL UP\n\nWe see more fences around more camp areas.\n\nKEEP PULLING UP\n\nThe entire place is filled with fences now, all the individual \nareas protected.\n\nThe skies are starting to darken- dusk is coming fast.\n\nFires start up. Dozens of them.\n\nStill darker.\n\nNow workers come racing home to their camps, anxious for safety \nbefore darkness takes over. They zig-zag this way, that way, \ndodging past each other sometimes they slam into each other, fall, \nget up, run on-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. Falling out of the sky.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAMP. The fires rise higher. No one moves... HOLD.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING in the main tent area. He is bathing his bloody hands. \nSamuel is with him. Both are exhausted.\n\nPatterson brings them each drinks. They nod thanks, drain them. \nThey stand there together, lit by the flames of their fire. You \nget the sense these three will be friends forever.\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\tWhat a good week.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou mean nobody died?\n\n\t\t\t\tSTARLING\n\t\t\t(shakes his head)\n\t\tWe all worked together.

It's really pretty.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON wading into the river- he stops as the sound of the \nchant comes distantly to him on the wind.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WORKMEN CHANTING LOUDER. It's turning into a stunner of a day- \nglorious blue sky broken up by pale clouds.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING. Pauses briefly, listening to the sound of the men.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEN WORKING AND SINGING. As before.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GRASSY FIELD. As before-\n\n-except it isn't. Because if you looked carefully, something \nflicked in a 180 degree arc. No telling what it was, it was gone \ntoo quickly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEN WORKING, SINGING ON.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON waist deep in the river, listening to the sound of the \nmen, of the birds. The sun is higher in the sky.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GRASSY FIELD-\n\n-and here it comes again, only the other way this time, flicking \nback in another 180 degree arc-\n\n-still hard to tell for sure what it was but maybe it was this: a \ntail. Now quickly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON wading out of the river as Samuel comes into view.

He smiles, folds the letter. Now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SINGING WORKMEN at Tsavo station- and they sense how good they \nsound, and they really concentrate on it, on making that sound \neven better-\n\n-there must be twenty of them, working and singing-\n\n-and screaming!\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, turning his head sharply and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, doing the same and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SCREAMING WORKMEN and they're running now, running and \nshrieking and that's all we see, the workmen-\n\n-some of them run left-\n\n-some run right-\n\n-and now a few of them are starting to cry.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FAT COOLIE running and running, glancing back, screaming louder, \nrunning on and on and\n\nCUT TO\n\n-a shadow in the grass- no telling what- but it's big and it's \nmoving and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FAT COOLIE and this next goes so fast it could be a dream- or, \nmore accurately, a nightmare-\n\nSHOCK CUT TO\n\nA GIGANTIC WHITE MANED LION as it leaps onto the Fat Coolie, \nbrings him to earth, bites his neck in two, kills him, just-like-\nthat.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, as they race away from the river and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, running from the fenced area- he holds a rifle in his \nhands.\n\nCUT TO\n\nANOTER PART OF THE CAMP AND A DIFFERENT BUNCH OF WORKMEN- they \nfreeze as the screams reach them and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, on the way to his tent area and\n\nCUT TO\n\nDIFFERENT WORKMEN listening in fear and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, racing to his tent, grabbing his rifle and cartridges \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, running toward the screaming and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, as he charges ahead, loading his rifle on the fly and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, carrying more ammunition, running behind Patterson, \nkeeping up and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTSAVO STATION and nothing is visible now- the men are gone and \nfrom this angle, it looks deserted and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION \narea, Samuel just behind them.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-\n\n-then they stop-\n\n-a sound is heard- from around the corner- the sound continues- \nPatterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the \ncrunching of bones.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, checking his rifle.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition, \nmoves close to Patterson. Now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the \ncorner and as he does-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his \nfeet-\n\n-then the lion stares toward the shed as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right \nwith him.

Dazed too. He points. Patterson registers, turns and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTARLING, LYING DEAD, his throat ripped open. HOLD briefly on the \nyoung man, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE STATION AREA\n\nA train from Mombassa is slowly pulling in. And things are fairly \nchaotic- there is the usual activity of what is ordinarily one of \nthe busier parts in camp-\n\n-but now, something new has been added: Abdullah is there with \nseveral dozen coolies who work under his command. THey are waiting \nfor the train.\n\nPatterson and Samuel are there too- and at the moment, Abdullah \nand Patterson are in the middle of a screamer- first one of them \nwalking away, then coming back, then the other doing the same.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(shouting over the noise\n\t\t\tof the approaching train)\n\t\t-oh, sing a different song, Abdullah-\n\t\t\t(gesturing toward the men\n\t\t\twho stand by the train\n\t\t\ttracks)\n\t\t-there's nothing wrong with your men\n\t\tso stop telling me there is-\n\n\t\t\t\tABDULLAH\n\t\t\t(advancing on Patterson now)\n\t\t-you do not call me a liar- you know\n\t\tnothing of their health- consider\n\t\tyourself fortunate I persuaded so \n\t\tmany to stay- consider yourself \n\t\tfortunate I have decided to stay-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(losing it)\n\t\tYou think you matter?\n\t\t\t(gesturing toward the\n\t\t\ttrain which is close to\n\t\t\tstopping now)\n\t\t-Beaumont is on that train- he \n\t\tmatters-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, moving in on Abdullah now-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHe sees this chaos, he'll replace \n\t\tyou all.\n\n\t\t\t\tABDULLAH\n\t\tHe'll replace you, too- that's all \n\t\tyou really care about.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou think so?

I hate Africa.\n\nNow there is the sudden sound of men singing- Patterson looks \naround and we\n\nCUT TO\n\nABDULLAH and his workmen, moving away from the train- they are \nsinging the same song that the workmen sang just before The Ghost \nand The Darkness attacked- it's pretty- but it's also a little \nunnerving.\n\nCUT TO\n\nBEAUMONT. Listening a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tLovely sound- they seem happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tDon't they, though?\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tSo work must be going well?\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON.

There is a sadness in the \nChief's tone.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(translating)\n\t\tThe Ghost and the Darkness have\n\t\tcome... and we can do nothing...\n\t\tbut if you anger them... they will\n\t\tstay in Tsavo... and life will\n\t\tbecome more unberable, that I know...\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, watching as Redbeard replies.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tTwo lions are all that have come...\n\t\tthey're only lions, that I know.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd I will kill them both tomorrow.\n\t\t\t(HOLD BRIEFLY, then-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nSHADOWS AND FIRELIGHT. IT'S NIGHT NOW.\n\nWe're not sure for a moment where we are but we can hear metallic \nsounds.\n\nNow we hear voices.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD VOICE (over)\n\t\tI'll need you by me in the morning.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL VOICE (over)\n\t\tWhatever you wish.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHERE WE ARE- IT'S PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. Patterson, Redbeard, \nHawthorne, and Samuel sit around a fire.\n\nTHey are cleaning their guns, getting ready.\n\nA WORD ABOUT THEIR WEAPONS. Patterson's is a good rifle and he \ncleans it expertly.\n\nRedbeard's surprisingly, is the oldest. And the way his hands move \nas he assembles it, he might be bathing a child.\n\nHawthorne is the least skilled of the three. But his rifle is \nclearly the finest. Bigger than the others, with great killing \npower.\n\nThere is a tremendous tension- Patterson, Hawthorne, and Samuel \nshow it. Redbeard is as before.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\t\t(terribly tense)\n\t\tYou're certain about tomorrow?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard is)\n\t\tBut you don't seem excited.\n\t\t\t(Redbeard isn't)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou don't enjoy killing, do you?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard doesn't)\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tThen why do it?\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. He stares at the fire. Then-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tI have a gift.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAMPFIRE. Silence for a moment except for the sound of the \nweapons being reassembled. Redbeard's hands fly. His rifle is back \ntogether. He stands, nods, goes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, watching him.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\tStrange man.\n\t\t\t(to Samuel)\n\t\tHas he always been this way?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tMuch gentler now.\n\n\t\t\t\tHAWTHORNE\n\t\t\t(shakes his head on that)\n\t\tJohn?-\n\t\t\t(He holds out his\n\t\t\tbeautiful rifle)\n\t\tChange guns with me- mine's much\n\t\tmore powerful.

BEFORE DAWN.\n\nMisty- hard to see much.\n\nThen GHOSTS appear-\n\nKEEP HOLDING\n\n-they're not ghosts, they're MASAI WARRIORS emerging from the \nmists. They are powerful and painted and they carry noisemaking \nequipment- tin cans and tom toms and as more and more of them \nmaterialize-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA HUGE THICKET.\n\nRedbeard, Patterson, and Samuel wait as the Warriors approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(whispered)\n\t\tI spotted one of them-\n\t\t\t(gesturing toward\n\t\t\tthe thicket)\n\t\t-in there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET again- alive with thorn trees. Dark, filled with long \ndark shadows.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. A lot of tension.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tThe best way to ensure the kill\n\t\twhen you're using trackers is for\n\t\tone to shoot while the other uses\n\t\tthe trackers to force the lion\n\t\ttoward the shooter.

Starting to appear more strongly on the horizon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, running like hell.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, moving quickly, silently.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA THICK CLUSTER 0F THORN TREES.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, ducking his head, blasting through.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, starting to cover the entire width of the thicket.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, quickstepping over rocky terrain.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL staying close to Redbeard.

They look to Redbeard.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Not yet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, racing into the clearing, glances around- lots of \nanthills.\n\nCUT TO\n\nAN ANTHILL, eight feet high. It casts a long shadow.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Holding Hawthorne's marvelous rifle, he slips silently \ninto the shadow.\n\nHOLD ON PATTERSON- it's almost as if he weren't there.\n\nCUT SHARPLY TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Suddenly screaming and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, screaming too and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, suddenly moving forward, all of them \nshouting and screaming and pounding on their drums and it is loud.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON in the shadow. The noise is faint- but he can hear it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DOZEN DRUMMERS, moving forward, banging away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DOZEN MORE DRUMMERS, even louder.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, moving forward, his eyes flicking ahead-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Just the least bit louder now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WHOLE LINE OF WARRIORS, screaming and pounding and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL- the fear worse, dogging Redbeard's steps.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. His eyes flicking ahead.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. It's a lot louder now. He's totally still. And he's \nready.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DENSEST PART OF THE THICKET we've seen yet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, slashing their way through, drumming and shouting \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, at their head, eyes, as always, flicking.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD. Nothing. No movement. No lion.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD- starting to suddenly get louder and point-\n\n-because something is there-\n\nCUT BACK TO\n\nTHE THICKET AHEAD, and we didn't see it before, only Redbeard saw \nit before-\n\n-but now something begins to move and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and it's all going crazy now, and \nthey're starting to move faster and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON IN THE SHADOW.\n\nThe noise has kicked up and all the time it's coming closer and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WARRIORS and the movement up ahead is more \ndistinct and the Warriors are almost in a frenzy as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FLASH OF THE GHOST IN THE THICKET- eyes bright- it starts to \nmove away from the sound-\n\n-and toward where Patterson is waiting.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Faster, screaming louder and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL and the fear starting to leave and he screams louder too \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON- he fingers the weapon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, angrily retreating faster from the sound- and now \ninstead of going straight back it begins to veer left and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, immediately spotting the shift, gesturingto the Warriors \nto get left and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, shifting over as Redbeard directed, blocking The \nGhost's intended path and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, shifting, trying to go the other way this time and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD; he spots that too, gestures for the Warriors to shift \nthe other way and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WARRIORS, racing to thier new positions, blocking the animal's \npath again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, rattled, upset, and now it starts retreating back in \nthe original direction- toward Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND THE WHOLE LONG LINE OF MEN, and it's as if mass \nhysteria has gripped them, because their sound keeps building and \nsure, their throats must ache and yes, their arms must tire, but \nyou couldn't tell that from what they're doing-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Waiting by the anthill. Waiting. Then, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, backing into view, staring back at the sound, unaware \nof Patterson's existence behind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Noiselessly he steps away from the anthill into the \nsunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, backing toward Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, sighting along the glistening barrel.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, starting to turn.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, ready to fire.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST IN CLOSE UP, CAUGHT IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE RIFLE. And \nnow its lips go back as it sees Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, CLOSE UP, and this is it, this is the moment and as he \nsqueezes the trigger-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE GHOST, and a totally unexpected sound- a dull \nsnap- Hawthorne's rifle has misfired.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, unharmed and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON desperately workingthe rifle, trying to make it function \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. It stares at Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and the goddamn gun won't work and he's a dead man and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE GHOST-\n\n-and for a moment, they might be frozen in some horrible tableau-\n\n-THEN THE GHOST ROARS-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD as he hears it, breaking into a wild run-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tShoot for chrissakes!-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON standing his ground as now THE GHOST takes a step toward \nhim.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, firing, reloading on the move, and up ahead is the \nclearing and as he reaches it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. Its great head turns in the direction of Redbeard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD's position- anthills block him from getting a clear shot \nat the animal- he curses, races for a better position and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. One final stare at Patterson-\n\n-then it makes an effortless leap intothe thicket-\n\n-and it's safe and free and gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Rocked.\n\nThe low point of his life.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, catching up to Redbeard.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tDid you ever see a lion that size?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNot even close.\n\t\t\t(Now he moves to\n\t\t\tPatterson)\n\t\tWhat happened?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(a whisper)\n\t\t...misfire... it jammed...\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tHas it ever done that before?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t...don't know...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tIt's Hawthorne's.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Trying for control.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tYou exchanged weapons?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tYou went into battle with an\n\t\tuntried gun?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. For a moment it's impossible to tell what he's \ngoing to do. It seems that a Homeric burst of fury is about to \nhappen.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Drained, he epects it. It's very quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREEDBEARD, studying the younger man. And when he finally speaks, \nhis voice is surprisingly quiet.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tThey have an expression in\n\t\tprizefighting: \"everyone has a plan\n\t\tuntil they're hit.\"\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tYou've just been hit...\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t...the getting up is up to you...\n\t\t\t(And he turns, moves\n\t\t\toff and)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL.\n\nNearly finished. The fence is eight feet high and Hawthorne is \nsupervising men and material that are being transferred.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, checking security in the New Hospital which is close to \nthe center of camp. (The Old Hospital was situated on the \noutskirts, because they wanted to keep the workers away from the \nsick and the wounded.) Late afternoon, now.\n\nPatterson, Samuel and Hawthorne are moving with him. As are TWO \nEXPERIENCED ORDERLIES, both armed with powerful rifles. Patterson \nis silent here, the effects of the misfire still evident on his \nface.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(to the Orderlies)\n\t\tGentlemen, there's no sickness smell\n\t\tat all here, and little blood. When\n\t\twe leave, close the gate securely,\n\t\tdon't open it til morning and keep\n\t\tyour fires high. Any questions, ask\n\t\tthem now.\n\t\t\t(They understand- now\n\t\t\tto Samuel and Hawthorne)\n\t\tYou two will sleep beautifully in\n\t\tyour tents.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAnd stay there.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tAnd where will you sleep beautifully?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(smile)\n\t\tPatterson and I will be in the old\n\t\thospital- where the enticing smell\n\t\tof sickness still lingers-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-and by the time we're done, I\n\t\tpromise you, the odor of blood will\n\t\tbe irresistible.\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL. STARTING TO GET DARK.\n\nRedbeard and Patterson have buckets which they empty around the \ninside perimeter-\n\n-buckets of blood.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Darker. They empty still more full buckets \nof blood. Redbeard seems pleased.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL AND HAWTHORNE, hurrying toward their camp.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, leading Masai cattle into the grounds of \nthe Old Hospital.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ORDERLIES IN THE NEW HOSPITAL, firmly closing and locking the \ngate.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, just outside the fence of the Old \nHospital- they carry many large chunks of raw meat, drop them as \nthey move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. Dying... dying...\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They slip inside the deserted Old \nHospital, pull the gate securely shut.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE. They stand in the center of the Old Hospital, calling \nto each other.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. Full. Clean. The men are exhausted. Most are \nalready asleep. The Orderlies sit by a fire, alert for anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL. Patterson and Redbeard stand across from their \nfire, waiting. The cows are quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE by his fire near his tent with Samuel. Nervously, they \ndrink tea.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MOON. Higher. An hour has passed. Perhaps more.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Walking the fence perimeter.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. The cows are edgy. He calms the cows.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE THE OLD HOSPITAL. The large chunks of meat are visible in \nthe moonlight.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. The orderlies are calm.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, still walking the perimeter.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON sitting by the fire, staring at the night. Redbeard \nmoves to him, speaks in a whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tThink about something else.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHave you ever failed?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(sad smile)\n\t\tOnly in life...\n\t\t\t(He walks away.\n\t\t\tPatterson watches.)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. The Orderlies tend the sick. Quietly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NIGHT AND THE MOON. Lovely.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly \nquiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from \nRedbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the \nripping of flesh-\n\nCAMERA MOVES UP\n\nNow we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in \nshadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.\n\nRedbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for \nPatterson to switch positions with him.\n\nAs he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.\n\nSilence again.\n\nPatterson reaches the far side of the fence.\n\nNow the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are \noutside, directly across from Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going \non, it's sure as hell odd.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out \nviolently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just \nbefore The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-\n\n-now a different sound is heard: scratching-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-\n\n-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the \nground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their \nbuckets.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this \nis it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CATTLE, going nuts and then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GATE. All pressure gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tGoddammit!\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIt's all right. Stay ready.\n\t\t\t(indicates the blood)\n\t\tThey know it's there.\n\nPatterson takes a few steps away, stares at the moon.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD; he studies Patterson who so clearly craves redemption.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(going to him)\n\t\tMeant to ask you- the railroad car\n\t\ttrap. Your idea?\n\t\t\t(Patterson nods)\n\t\tExcellent notion- I used the same\n\t\tdevice myself once.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tBut of course yours worked.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIn point of fact it didn't- but I'm\n\t\tconvinced the idea is sound.\n\nHe goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and \nfor the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to \nlift.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL\n\nand an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the \nfire and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before \nhe can scream-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant \npaws slap out so fast we can't follow and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting \nto spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA PAW flashing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed \nface and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, leaping on them and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-\n\n-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry \nwe've heard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND \nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-\n\n-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it \nand he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel \ndoes his best to stop him-\n\n-but Hawthorne rips free and we\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMEDICINE, flying across the tent and\n\nCUT TO\n\nGLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those \nterrible bright blazing eyes and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this: \ndestroying the New Hospital and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMORE TENTS collapsing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring \naround-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-\n\n-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New \nHospital and the instant they are heard\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open \nand they're off as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.) \nThe tents are all down. The place is devastated.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPAN ALONG THE TENT\n\nDead. Blood. Pain.\n\nPAN TO THE SECOND TENT\n\nMore dead.\n\nMore dying.\n\nIt's a slaughterhouse.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his \nlast.\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at \neach other-\n\n-then they slow.\n\nBecause the New Hospital has come into view.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.\n\nAnd this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's \ngoing to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands \nthere. Just stands there. Unable to move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.\n\nHe stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere. \nHawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.\n\nAll that's left now is this: the sound of pain.\n\nHOLD.\n\nDust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.\n\nNow different sounds take over-\n\n-an incredible babble of human voices.\n\nAND A RAILROAD TRAIN.\n\nPatterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his \nface, is a few steps behind.\n\nWe are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled \ninto the station-\n\n-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are \nworkers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber \nup onto the roofs of the cars-\n\n-covering the cars-\n\n-everyone is leaving-\n\n-Patterson can only watch.\n\nAbdullah stands on one of the cars-\n\n-the train begins to pull out of the station.\n\nMore and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.\n\nNow the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.\n\nPatterson still watches, eyes vacant.\n\nAbdullah sees him, looks away.\n\nThe train gathers speed.\n\nRounds a corner...\n\n...gone...\n\nPatterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close \nbehind him, the worried look still there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OLD HOSPITAL.\n\nA FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches \nonly a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only \nAfricans remain.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson \nlooks at it a moment, walks on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson \nlooks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his \ntent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.\n\nIT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.\n\nPatterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he \nnever takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BRIDGE.\n\nIt stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a \nlot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon. \nDesolate.\n\nRedbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as \nhe did the night before.\n\nPatterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven, \nwrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.\n\nFor a moment, neither says a word. Then-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(out of the blue)\n\t\tIt would have been a beautiful \n\t\tbridge, John. I never noticed \n\t\tbefore, occupied with other \n\t\tbusiness, I\tsuppose...\n\t\t\t(He's rambling)\n\t\t...never really pay much attention\n\t\tto that kind of thing but I've had\n\t\tthe time today, nothing else on,\n\t\tand this... it's graceful and the\n\t\tplacement couldn't be prettier...\n\t\tand...\n\t\t\t(He goes silent now,\n\t\t\tstares off)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou just got hit.\n\t\t\t(Redbeard nods)\n\t\tThe getting up is up to you- but\n\t\tthey're only lions-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-and I'm going after them crack\n\t\tof dawn...\n\t\t\t(And on that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-\n\n-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet \ntall- gorgeous early morning light.\n\nAs we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the \ncliff.\n\nAs we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.\n\nCAMERA MOVES CLOSER.\n\nTHE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the \nrock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of \ncourse, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind. \nThey travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand, \nstare out.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if \nyou fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on \ntheir movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard \nstarts to speak. They don't stop moving.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tIn my town, when I was little,\n\t\tthere was a brute, a bully who\n\t\tterrorized the place.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBut he was not the problem. He\n\t\thad a brother who was worse than\n\t\the. But the brother was not the\n\t\tproblem.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tOne or the other of them was\n\t\tusually in jail. The problem came\n\t\twhen they were both free togther.\n\t\tThe two became different from\n\t\teither alone.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tAlone they were only brutes.\n\t\tTogether they became lethal,\n\t\ttogether they killed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhat happened to them?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI got big.\n\t\t\t(They move on)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's \nhard going. They help each other.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now. \nSlow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it: \nthere is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used \nit as a regular passage.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a \nword move through it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing: \na cave.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward \nit.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low \ntunnel you have to half-crawl through.\n\nWithout a word, they start inside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel. \nAhead there is light. They move on.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just \na copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.\n\nNow they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary- \ndark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's \ndank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. CLOSE UP. Thunderstruck-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tDear God-\n\t\t\t(And on those words-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FLOOR OF THE CAVE. More copper bracelets. And still more-\n\n-and now bones-\n\n-the floor of the place is littered with human bones-\n\n-eyeless skulls peer up at them from all around.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nThe rest of the cave. We are looking at a carpet of bones.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tTheir den?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard nods)\n\t\tHave you ever seen anything like\n\t\tthis?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNobody's seen anything like this.\n\t\tLions don't have caves like this-\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\t-they're doing it for pleasure.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSEVERAL TUNNELS, dark and ominous, leading from the cave-\n\n-and now there is a sound from one of the tunnels-\n\n-something is coming close and coming fast and\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON as Redbeard fires into the tunnel and the \nsound explodes-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TUNNEL-\n\n-shrieks-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD AND PATTERSON. What the hell is it?\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TUNNEL- and here they come, screeching and angry-\n\n-bats-\n\n-swarms of them- hundreds of them-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, diving to the ground, lying there amidst \nthe bangles and the bones and the skulls-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS. Circling above them. Screeching louder.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, lying very still, eyeless skulls all \naround, staring.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS. For a moment, it seems as if they might attack.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTRSON AND REDBEARD. Waiting, waiting. Then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BATS  back into the tunnel and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, scrambling to their feet.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tOne of my chief attributes is that\n\t\tI'm always calm.\n\nAnd then without warning, from behind them, a roar-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD spin around, start back toward the entrance \nof the cave-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE LOW ENTRANCE TUNNEL as they scramble half-crawling through it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE as they make it, stand straight, look around-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHICK BUSH beyond- another roar and sudden movement and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, entering the thick bush- but carefully, \nbecause they are vulnerable now and an attack could come from \nanywhere- there is the sound of water-\n\n-slashes of light hit their eyes, making it hard to see- and \nthey're totally vulnerable now but it doesn't stop them- the water \nsound gets stronger- and as they burst clear-\n\nCUT TO\n\nAN AMAZING PLACE- AN AREA OF FLAT ROCK SPLIT UP AHEAD BY A WIDE \nFAST-RUNNING WATERFALL.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They look around. Nothing is there. But \nthe spot is wide open, exposed.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(The words pour out)\n\t\tWhere could it have gone? How\n\t\tcould it get across the water?\n\t\t\t(looks at Redbeard)\n\t\tThey're only lions, yes?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(shakes his head; he\n\t\t\tdoesn't know)\n\t\tDon't they have to be?...\n\nThey look around a moment more. Nothing to see-\n\n-they turn, leave, re-enter the thick bush. And now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS- who knows where it is but it's there-\n\n-watching Patterson.\n\nHOLD BRIEFLY on The Darkness, then-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON'S TENT AREA. JUST BEFORE DAWN-\n\n-outside the fence a dreadful sound- the crunching of bones.\n\nPatterson, Redbeard, and Samuel emerge from tents, listen. \nPatterson is on one side of the area, Redbeard and Samuel on the \nother.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tBoth of them over there.\n\nHe is pointing to Patterson's area. Patterson goes to Redbeard.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tEver have to use a machan?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard hasn't)\n\t\tI did once. In India. We will \n\t\ttonight.\n\t\t\t(Now from that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA CLEARING. LATER IN THE DAY.\n\nPatterson leads the few remaining men in constructing an odd \nlooking structure: four slender poles lashed together, slanting \ninward with a plank tied on top, a dozen feet up in the air. \nRedbeard and Samuel approach.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tThey're used to people in trees,\n\t\tnot in a clearing.\n\t\t\t(indicating the plank)\n\t\tIt may be tight.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tNot for me- I'm too bulky and it's\n\t\tyour idea, you go up there.\n\t\t\t(to Samuel)\n\t\tTake the others to the water tower\n\t\tfor the night.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'll be bait alone?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tYes. And I'll be in some distant\n\t\ttree where I can provide no\n\t\tassistance whatsoever.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tCan you control your fear?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI'll have to.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tI can't control mine- I'd be lost\n\t\twithout the shame factor driving me.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWas that supposed to make me feel\n\t\tbetter?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard doesn't\n\t\t\treply. Now-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nA DONKEY BEING LED IN. LATER.\n\nTHE MEN start to tie it down, across the clearing from the machan.\n\nPatterson takes a long look at the machan. He tests the support \npoles- they're rickety.\n\nCUT TO\n\nDUSK. The sun quickly beginning its quick fall.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE WATER TOWER IN THE STATION AREA. Samuel is with the remaining \nmen who clamber up to the platform on top.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY IN THE CLEARING. Quiet.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nRedbeard, holding a wooden ladder that is propped against the \nplank. Patterson climbs his slow way up. It's dangerous.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE PLANK as Patterson makes it, clambers off the ladder, manages \nto sit.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE VIEW. Nothing is around the machan. He is totally vulnerable.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, taking the ladder down. Patterson tries to get \ncomfortable. He can't.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(glancing around)\n\t\tIt's certainly the best chance\n\t\tthey've had to kill you.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou think they'll come then?\n\t\t\t(Redbeard does)\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(not answering)\n\t\tGood luck.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tBecause I think they're after you.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. This registers. Finally, he nods. Redbeard starts to \nleave.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tHow many do you think they've \n\t\tkilled?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(reluctantly)\n\t\tThe most of any lions... a \n\t\thundred...?\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tProbably more.\n\t\t\t(Now Redbeard looks\n\t\t\tup at the younger man)\n\t\tJohnny...?\n\nThey study each other in the gathering darkness. They've been \nthrough a lot together, these two. They're not what they were when \nthey first met. An emotional moment clearly is at hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tDon't fuck up.\n\t\t\t(And he turns, never\n\t\t\tlooks back, just goes)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He is alone now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSHADOWS. Growing longer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. On top of the water tower. The remaining men are with him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. It peers around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. His fingers move slowly along his rifle barrel-\n\n-there is no noise- but you have the sense that, at any second, \nthe world could explode.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees. \nNothing unusual.\n\nMOVE IN CLOSER:\n\nRedbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. About to die.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He \nstops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin, \ngiving it color.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just \nset, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and \nin a blink it isn't. As it drops-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. It's madness that he's up here. And he knows \nit. And that shows.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. Quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of \nhim past the donkey.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at \nthe donkey.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.\n\nAnd now, just the beginning of a mist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD \nMORNING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends, \nlistening for something, anything-\n\n-but all there is is silence.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to \nscream.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing \nmist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, listening, listening-\n\n-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear \nit but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-\n\n-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a \ntwig.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-\n\nHOLD ON THE DONKEY.\n\nBecause now something happens that hasn't happened before: \nsuddenly there are no colors, only tones-\n\n-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's \nhappening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of \nthe lion-\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nTHE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.\n\nAnd from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW, \neverything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.\n\nWhen we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally \nclear- and sounds are thunderous.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer \nas The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be \nsome movement in the bushes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but \nthe mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.\n\nHOLD.\n\nNow there is something else visible, something behind the donkey: \nthe four legs of the platform.\n\nHOLD.\n\nNow we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.\n\nHOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-\n\n-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around \nthe platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He \nhalf turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is \nbehind him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to \nchange.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about \nthe donkey anymore, it's stalking him.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling, \nalways closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know \nhe's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do \nanything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the \nlion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite \nseen.)\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to \nlet the animal's position out of his sight.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come \napart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on \nturning.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him- \nthat's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree, \nalmost knocking him off the plank and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and \nhe's trying not to fall and\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and \nas he starts his leap-\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing \nhis rifle, firing again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins, \nlands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes \nand the night has him and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSUDDEN DAWN AND PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, running, stopping, staring \nat the ground-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GROUND. Blood.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving quickly forward again-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GROUND. More blood and...\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TWO OF THEM, starting to slow-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSTRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen, \nsome of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND REDBEARD. They separate, take different paths \nthrough the anthills.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. Alert. One step at a time.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. The same. One step at at time.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST. Crouched high up behind one of the biggest anthills, \nstaring down at them both.\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they \nmight be statues.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them \nand as he does-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, launched in mid-air and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-\n\n-and FREEZE.\n\nFreeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.\n\nHOLD. THen-\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-\n\n-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment \nwhen the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-\n\n-only now eight men appear, carrying The Ghost- eight is the \nactual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead \nanimal to the ground-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nBEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully, \nand there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA PHOTOGRAPHER; loads of bulky equipment. Patterson and Redbeard \nstand behind him, watching him. We're in a lovely spot by the \nriver. Patterson and Redbeard have definitely been drinking.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tI think another for posterity-\n\t\tthis is an important moment in\n\t\tmy life.\n\nHe strikes another pose- the Photographer goes to work.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tUnderstand, I had help-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t-not a time for modesty, Bob-\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t-undeniably your triumph.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tOh surely there's enough credit\n\t\tfor us all- let's not forget, you\n\t\tdid the actual shooting. Of course,\n\t\tI hired you, I was the general who\n\t\tput the team together. And generals\n\t\tare the ones who tend to be\n\t\tremembered.\n\n\t\t\t\tPHOTOGRAPHER\n\t\tPerhaps you might put your head in\n\t\tits mouth, sir- could be a corker.\n\n\t\t\t\tBEAUMONT\n\t\tClever idea, I like it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE MOUTH OF THE GHOST- it is huge-\n\n-Beaumont manages to get it open- puts his head between the \nenormous set of teeth- he's nervous, tries to hide it when we\n\nCUT TO\n\nREDBEARD suddenly giving a loud imitation of a lion roaring and\n\nCUT TO\n\nBEAUMONT, surprised and frightened-\n\n-he jerks his head away-\n\n-there is the sound of laughter, Patterson's and Redbeard's-\n\n-Beaumont tries for his smile, can't bring it off, looks around, \nhumiliated, and as the laughter builds-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TENT AREA. NIGHT.\n\nPatterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them, \ntheir first, no fear in the vicinity.\n\nIt should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of \nchampagne.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away \nfrom the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his \neyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure- \nhe is more at ease with the world.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tI never thought I'd say this, but\n\t\tI'm glad you came.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tUnderstood- you realize now you\n\t\tcould never have done it without\n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tActually, I could have done it\n\t\tmuch more easily without you, but\n\t\tfor whatever reason, I'm glad you\n\t\tcame.\n\t\t\t(They toast each other)\n\nSamuel, with his own bottle of champagne has wandered over, joins \nthem.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(drunk)\n\t\tWhere do you go next?\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tSome Russian princes want to hunt\n\t\tthe Himalayas. You?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tHelp finish the railroad.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI want to meet my son- he must be\n\t\twhat, two months old?\n\nThey look at the fire a moment. Then-\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\tThree years I've worked for the\n\t\trailroad. Now I don't know why. It\n\t\tseemed a good idea once.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tI feel the same about the bridge.\n\t\tThis country certainly didn't ask\n\t\tfor it, doesn't need it.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tToo soon to tell.\n\nThey look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\tMy life was shaped because someone\n\t\tinvented gunpowder. Our lives have\n\t\tcrossed because two lions went mad.\n\t\tBut what if in the future the three\n\t\tof us do something grand for\n\t\thumanity? Was that worth all the\n\t\tlives? Too soon to tell.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(drinks)\n\t\tSome mysteries should not have \n\t\tsolutions.\n\n\t\t\t\tREDBEARD\n\t\t\t(finishes his bottle,\n\t\t\trises, looks at Patterson)\n\t\tHold your son high.\n\t\t\t(And he turns, goes\n\t\t\tto his tent)\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\t\t(beat- quietly)\n\t\tHe has children?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(beat- quietly)\n\t\tOnce...\n\t\t\t(HOLD on the two\n\t\t\tin the firelight. Then-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE STATION MASTER AT TSAVO STATION, WORKING IN HIS OFFICE. THE \nNEXT DAY.\n\n\t\t\t\tFEMALE VOICE (over)\n\t\tI'd like to see John Patterson,\n\t\tplease.\n\t\t\t(As he looks up-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA standing there in Tsavo; she looks weary from travel, but \nstill lovely. She holds their son in her arms. The kid is \nadorable.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELENA\n\t\tCould you tell him that his wife-\n\t\t\t(catches herself, smiles)\n\t\t-that his family has come to see him.\n\t\t\t(On that-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news- \nPatterson takes off running and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back \nand forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all \nbut her heels.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station \narea.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the \nbuilding, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly \nand\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, excitedly waving back and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly screaming \"Get back- back-\"\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind- \nshe smiles again, waves again and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, \"GET BACK\" and\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the \nsame, she stops and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, starting to run and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get \nthere, he's never going to get there-\n\nCUT TO\n\nHELENA, and at last she knows something is terribly wrong and she \nturns-\n\n-but too late, too late as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, flying toward her now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, in agony.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as \nHelena cries out helplessly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, crying out helplessly and\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON IN HIS TENT,\n\ncontinuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had \nis over-\n\n-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.\n\nCUT TO\n\nOUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the \ndream. He looks around.\n\nRedbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nINSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-\n\n-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SUN. RISING.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash \nacross a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do, \nwidening the area of search and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, veering off and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the \ndamage to his clothes or his skin and\n\nCUT TO\n\nMORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow- \nPatterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-\n\n-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working \novertime and is only getting worse-\n\nPatterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-\n\n-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again, \nlouder-\n\n-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-\n\nCUT TO\n\nA FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.\n\nWith one patch in the middle that is blood red.\n\nSomething is moving in the blood red area.\n\nPatterson has his rifle ready-\n\n-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen \nsomething beyond imagination.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to \nwhere Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down \ninto the grass-\n\n-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and \nSamuel stare mute at one another-\n\n-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar \nof The Darkness. They don't even react.\n\nCUT TO\n\nFLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.\n\nWe should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this \nbefore.\n\nSTART PULLING BACK.\n\nSamuel stands there, trying to hold it together.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK.\n\nPatterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.\n\nKEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL\n\nREDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.\n\nJust Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.\n\nThe flames lick at the sky...\n\nHOLD...\n\nCUT TO\n\nA LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING \nDARK NOW.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, both armed, climbing the crane tower in use \nat the bridge, not far from the baboon.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tYou're positive lions hate baboons?\n\t\t\t(Samuel is)\n\t\tPebbles?\n\t\t\t(Samuel holds up a bag)\n\t\tLet's get it over with.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL as they reach the crane tower platform, \nfifteen feet from the baboon.\n\nThey help each other into position. Almost night.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into \nthe darkness.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble \ntoward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but \nirritation-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S \nTHE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.\n\nThey're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries \nout.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.\n\nHe's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild; \nonly nervous energy is keeping him going now.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and \nfrightening black clouds gather and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky \nis not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to \nhallucinate.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.\n\nSamuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, hallucinating again.\n\nCUT TO\n\nJUST BEFORE DAWN\n\nand The Darkness suddenly is there, creeping across the bridge \ntoward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Firing-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-THE DARKNESS, and it's hit and it roars and goes down and-\n\nCUT TO\n\n-PATTERSON, turning, reaching for Samuel's rifle, grabbing it, \nturning back, ready to fire again-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS- gone.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL, blinking, looking around.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tWhere is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(pointing down)\n\t\tUnderneath.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tSomewhere.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes \nseveral levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.\n\nThey look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we\n\nCUT TO\n\nEARLY MORNING LIGHT.\n\nPatterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to \nthe railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson \nreleases the baboon which races away.\n\nCUT TO\n\nWHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began \nconstruction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away \nbefore them.\n\nCUT TO\n\nThey begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...\n\n..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level, \nmaking sure they miss nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Ready for anything.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. It seems empty.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their \nbreaths.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. It seems empty.\n\nCUT TO\n\nA SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, firing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SCAFFOLDING. Nothing is visible.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND SAMUEL- Frozen. They listen-\n\n-nothing but their breathing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, looking around everywhere.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, looking this way, that way.\n\nSHOCK CUT TO\n\nTHE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson \nfalls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it \ngets up and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-\n\n-only Samuel isn't there-\n\n-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS ROARING AND\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the \nnarrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without \nslipping or falling and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it \ntakes off after Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the \nnearest tree and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a \ndead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary \nspeed, it's still faster than Patterson and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's \njust up ahead and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, closing and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE TREE, and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, springing into the air now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both \nhands, swinging his body up as we\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the \nbranch and now comes this insane roar and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen \nfeet up.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's \ntree, raging with frustration.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, exhausted but it's okay now, he's safe, and as he looks \nacross at the next tree not far away where Samuel is-\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL\n\t\t\t(embarrassed)\n\t\tAfraid of lions.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON.\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tIt's all right, Samuel- we all\n\t\tget hit-\n\t\t\t(Now he shuts up \n\t\t\tfast and-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, as it does this incredible thing- it starts to climb \nthe tree after Patterson. Lions are cats and when they want to \nclimb, up they go and that's what The Darkness is doing now, going \nup and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, and it's terrifying- he reaches for the branch above, \nclimbing higher and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, climbing higher too and the tree is sturdy but there \nis a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, going still higher but the branches are getting thinner \nand the tree is shaking, and he could fall-\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, climbing on, nothing can stop it-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS, together in the tree, and there's no \nfurther Patterson can go and it's harder for The Darkness too, but \nslowly it moves in and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, calling out-\n\n\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n\t\tSamuel!\n\t\t\t(And he gestures for\n\t\t\tthe rifle and the\n\t\t\tinstant he does-)\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, and he takes the rifle between his two hands and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, steadily moving in and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, tossing the rifle with great care and Patterson's less \nthan fifteen feet away and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, hands out to catch it and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIFLE in mid-air and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, both hands ready and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE RIFLE as it strikes a tree branch, spins away to the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, almost on Patterson now and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, suddenly leaping out of the tree, and yes it's a long \nway and sure it's going to damage him but sometimes there aren't a \nlot of choices in this world and\n\nCUT TO\n\nSAMUEL, staring as Patterson falls and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, crashing hard to earth, stunned, hurt, ribs broken, leg \nbroken and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, and it's so big it's hard for it to get room to turn \nbut it does and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON crawling for the rifle, and he's in terrible pain but he \nreaches the weapon, grabs for it and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, skittering down the tree and as it reaches the \nground\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, forcing himself to his feet and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, a dozen feet away as with a roar it starts its \ncharge.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, aims, fires and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, hit again and down it goes again but up it comes \nagain and\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, firing the final shot and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, hit again and it has to stop, it just has to-\n\n-but it doesn't.\n\nIt roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a \nbranch, lands hard and\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now \nfour, now-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON, helpless on the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-\n\n-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge \nteeth into the branch-\n\n-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. Can't breathe.\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour \ndown his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with \nsobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...\n\nHOLD.\n\nKEEP HOLDING.\n\nCAMERA BEGINS TO RISE-\n\n-WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BRIDGE NOW- AND IT'S FINISHED!\n\n-hundreds of people are watching as the first train goes oer it-\n\n-Samuel is there- lighting up the world with his smile-\n\n-and Patterson's there, too. He stands with Helena, his young son \nin his arms.\n\nEverybody smiles, everybody waves, the train goes triumphantly by.\n\nCUT TO\n\nPATTERSON. He looks wonderful again, vibrant and young. Watching \nhim, you might think he hadn't been through the nightmare as he \nstands there, holding the boy tightly.\n\nBut with his other hand, he fingers the lion claw necklace...\n\nHOLD ON PATTERSON.\n\nNow slowly dissolve to an African evening. Animals stretch from \none horizon to the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAMUEL VOICE (over)\n\t\tHere we still wonder about them.\n\t\tHow did they escape for nine months?\n\t\tAnd kill 135 men?
