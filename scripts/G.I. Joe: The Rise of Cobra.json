SILENCE. The following words sear onto screen:\n          Whenever a new breed of evil\n          emerges, a new breed of solider\n          must fight it.\n\n          -- GENERAL CLAYTON \"HAWK\" ABERNATHY\n\n          EXT. THE BASTILLE - PARIS - NIGHT\n\n          A HEAVY NIGHT MIST swirls around the imposing stone walls of\n          the Bastille. PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes\n          as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.\n\n          SUPER: PARIS, 1641\n\n          INT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT\n\n          A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison\n          cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in\n          the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles\n          some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.\n          Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at\n          all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud\n          defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around\n          his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN.\n          The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the\n          ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks\n          with a thick Scottish brogue.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Still using matchlocks, are ya? I\n          can get you a pair of flintlocks,\n          you let me sneak out of here.\n          Everyone else in this sequence speaks with a French accent.\n\n          GUARD #1\n\n          (TEMPTED)\n          Good ones?\n          The other Guard glares at him. McCullen goes for the kill.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          The best. From Spain. And perhaps a\n          couple of pretty young ladies to\n          teach you how to use them.\n          Guard #1 is even more tempted, but his partner is a Loyalist.\n\n          GUARD #2\n          On yer feet, you Scottish pig.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          2.\n\n          INT. FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT\n\n          Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in\n          a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The\n          two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to\n          fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the\n          Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the\n          charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.\n\n          WARDEN\n          James McCullen, you have been found\n          guilty of treason for the sale of\n          military arms to the enemies of our\n          Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst\n          you sold arms to our Lord himself.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Your King is a vile bag of filth\n          who murders his own allies. I\n          should've charged him double.\n\n          WARDEN\n          You tried to overthrow the Crown in\n          conspiracy with its enemies!\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          They offered me a Chancellorship,\n          because unlike your simpleton King,\n          they know that is the McCullen\n          destiny, to run the wars, the true\n          power, not simply to supply arms.\n\n          WARDEN\n          Do you have anything else to say\n          before the sentence is carried out?\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Yes, I do. Clan McCullen is far\n          bigger and more powerful than any\n          of you could ever imagine. My sons\n          will continue to rise along after I\n          am gone. As will their sons. And,\n          God willing, their sons.\n\n          (SMILES)\n          It shall not end with my death.\n          The Warden smiles back sinisterly.\n\n          WARDEN\n          Oh, we're not going to kill you,\n          McCullen. We're going to make an\n          example of you.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          3.\n          The Warden gives a nod to the prison workers who remove the\n          METALLIC OBJECT from the fire. McCullen sees what it is\n          before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK\n          being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous\n          creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.\n\n          WARDEN (CONT'D)\n          So that no man, woman, nor child\n          may ever see your treacherous face\n          again, you shall wear this mask for\n          the term of your natural life.\n          The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.\n          McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.\n\n          EXT. NATO HEADQUARTERS - BRUSSELS - DAY\n\n          The many flags of NATO flap outside its massive headquarters.\n\n          SUPER: NATO HEADQUARTERS, BELGIUM\n\n          MCCULLEN (V.0.)\n          War used to be the exception. Now\n          it is the new state of play, a\n          constant, unavoidable...\n\n          INT. BRIEFING CHAMBER - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n          The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN,\n          gazing over a lectern in a darkened room. Like his doomed\n          ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Tragic as they are to fight, wars\n          must be won. But perhaps they don't\n          have to be as destructive as\n          they've been in the past.\n          A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen\n          behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY\n          COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          Nano-mites. Perfect little\n          soldiers. Their size can be\n          programmed as well as their\n          intended task. Originally developed\n          to isolate and destroy cancer\n          cells, but at Mars Industries, and\n          with the help of a little NATO\n          funding...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          4.\n          A few laughs around the room. McCullen soaks it up.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          .we discovered how to program\n          them to eliminate most anything.\n          For instance... metal.\n          ON SCREEN: A SOLDIER fires a shoulder-launched missile at a\n          tank. The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC\n          NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a\n          horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and\n          quickly head for a nearby jeep.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          Once the target has been destroyed,\n          the launcher triggers a kill switch\n          unique to each warhead that short-\n          circuits the nano-mites, preventing\n          any unwanted destruction.\n          ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and\n          the NANO-MITES instantly \"drop dead\" around the nearby jeep.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          Each warhead contains seven million\n          nano-mites and has the ability to\n          eat anything from a single tank to\n          an entire city.\n          (to consummate salesman)\n          But without innocent casualties.\n          Which is why this has been such a\n          priority for me and my company.\n          The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a\n          British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.\n\n          HAWK\n          Guess you'll be the first arms\n          dealer up for the Nobel Peace\n          Prize.\n          Laughter in the room. McCullen smiles, being a good sport.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          I prefer the term \"armament\n          solutions engineer\"\n          (more chuckles)\n          Gentlemen! I'm pleased to announce\n          that tomorrow morning your first\n          order of nanotech warheads will\n          ship from my factory in Kyrgyzstan.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          5.\n\n          INT. MARS FACTORY - NIGHT\n\n          FOUR GLASS-LIKE WARHEADS, each the size of a softball, are\n          placed into four separate compartments inside a WEAPONS CASE\n          by a pair of LAB WORKERS. The KILL SWITCHES are secured next\n          to each warhead. As the case is closed and locked we see the\n          MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.\n\n          SUPER: KYRGYZSTAN, CENTRAL ASIA\n\n          INT. MEN'S ROOM - MARS FACTORY - NIGHT\n\n          A PAIR OF DOG TAGS drop INTO FRAME in SLOW MOTION. We see the\n          name: \"HAUSER, CONRAD R.\" Still not seeing his face, we watch\n          our soldier strap into his BODY ARMOR and clip on his BATTLE\n          HARNESS. His NAME TAG simply reads: \"DUKE\". He loads his into\n          the mirror (is that a look of disdain?) and we get our first\n          glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a\n          BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.\n          The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There\n          is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier,\n          STALWORTH, steps out. He goes to the sink next to Duke and\n          splashes water on his face. He's pale and sweaty.\n\n          DUKE\n          The hell's wrong with you,\n          Stalworth, you didn't eat that\n          Chicken A La King at chow did ya?\n\n          STALWORTH\n          The mission, sir...\n\n          DUKE\n          What about it? Another day, another\n          run.\n\n          STALWORTH\n          Never had anything to worry about\n          before.\n          Stalworth's shaky hand pulls a photo out and shows it to\n          Duke: A YOUNG MOTHER with a NEWBORN in her arms.\n\n          STALWORTH (CONT'D)\n          Three weeks old. Be seeing him for\n          the first time next leave.\n          Duke looks at the picture, then at Stalworth. His eyes go\n          distant thinking about his own past, then they harden again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          6.\n\n          DUKE\n          You're off the mission.\n\n          STALWORTH\n          Sir?\n\n          DUKE\n          That's what you want, right?\n          Stalworth doesn't argue. Duke hands him back the photo.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          If your head's with them, you're no\n          good to me.\n          Stalworth nods. Duke steps closer, now one mean s.o.b.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          One thing, though: you step off\n          this one, you're out of Special\n          Forces. Gonna find you a nice desk\n          and chair back at the base. You're\n          be run of the mill. Regular.\n\n          STALWORTH\n          I... I guess I can live with that.\n\n          DUKE\n          Then you should.\n          Stalworth nods, grabs his kit, and leaves. Duke's hard eyes\n          watch him go, then a slight smile creases his lips ...\n\n          INT. CORRIDOR - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n          McCullen exits the briefing room into the corridor outside,\n          shaking hands with various Military Commanders. Hawk watches\n          with his aide, a gorgeous German Lieutenant, COURTNEY \"COVER\n          GIRL\" KRIEGER. When McCullen is alone, Hawk makes his move.\n\n          HAWK\n          Mr McCullen, Clayton Aernathy,\n          British Army.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          (shaking hands)\n          I know who you are General hawk.

I had NATO assign an\n          elite American Special Forces unit,\n          a fully armored convoy with air\n          support. I assure you, my warheads\n          will be quite safe.\n\n          HAWK\n          I've made a career of showing up\n          where I'm needed, whether ordered\n          to or not. And if your warheads are\n          half as effective as you say they\n          are.. Then my unit is needed.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          This is no time to play catch up.\n          The NATO team's been drilling for\n          weeks. They're lit up and ready to\n          roll.\n\n          HAWK\n          My unit doesn't need mission\n          specific training. They're chosen\n          because of their ability to handle\n          any situation.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          8.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Maybe next time, General...\n          (moves to go, stops)\n          What did you say your unit was\n          called?\n\n          HAWK\n          I didn't. I just said they were\n          always ready.\n          McCullen continues on down the hall. Hawk gives Cover Girl a\n          look, she reads it and nods. WE SMASH CUT TO:\n\n          INT.

It's a next-gen \"TYPHOON\" GUNSHIP.\n          The Blackhawk hoses the Typhoon with its six-barrelled MINI-\n          GUNS. But the rounds bounce off the Typhoon's angled armor.\n          The CONCUSSION CANNONS fire at the second Blackhawk, catching\n          it on the nose, crushing it into a flaming ball and sending\n          it reeling ass-over-tail-rotor into the ground behind the\n          rear Cougar, hemming in the convoy.\n          The Grizzly launches two HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES off its roof-\n          turret, but the Typhoon guns them down and fires again.

CONVOY - MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY\n\n          A SIDE DOOR on the Typhoon hisses open to reveal six\n          \"VIPERS\", menacing foot soldiers clad head to toe in black\n          BATTLE ARMOR, and armed with fearsome PULSE RIFLES. They exit\n          the Typhoon and spread out to kill anyone left.\n          The decimated Special Forces troops in the Grizzly OPEN FIRE\n          with ASSAULT RIFLES, but the bullets can't penetrate the\n          Viers' armor. The Vipers fire back, the impact from their\n          pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and\n          fling them backwards.\n          Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them\n          toward the Typhoon. The Vipers shoot one grenade out of the\n          air with their pulse rifles. It EXPLODES well out of range as\n          the other grenade lands on the ground int he middle of the\n          pack. Another shot from a pulse rifle punches the grenade six\n          feet underground. A DULL WHOOMP, lifts the ground by a foot.\n          Meanwhile, another figure emerges out of the Typhoon. Long,\n          slender legs in high black boots, the rest if her covered in\n          black, form-fitting BODY ARMOR. She's beautiful, exotic, and\n          most of all, lethal. She's known in certain circles only as\n          \"THE BARONESS\" but we will know her as ANA. Her DARK GLASSES\n          glint menacingly as she strides towards the Grizzly.\n          The two Special Forces Soldiers who threw the grenades pop up\n          to shoot her. But she quick-draws a pair of PULSE PISTOLS.\n          BOOM! BOOM!

Ana\n          turns with the weapons case in time to see Duke and Rip go\n          ass-over-teacups down into a ditch. She touches the stem of\n          her glasses which ZOOM IN on Duke.\n          DOWN IN THE DITCH: Duke rolls over and looks at Rip.\n\n          DUKE\n          Stay here.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          (really messed up)\n          Sure.\n\n          DUKE\n          I'm gettin' that package.\n          Duke leaps up and hauls-ass down the ditch, then crouch-runs\n          up the embankment. --And comes face to face with a Viper, who\n          raises his pulse rifle, about to blow Duke away. A hand\n          clamps down over the barrel.\n          The Viper looks at Ana beside him. Duke also looks at her, a\n          flash of shocking recognition ripples across his face.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          16.\n          Ana touches the stem of her glasses and the DARK LENSES turn\n          clear, revealing her gorgeous eyes.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          What the hell...?\n          Her face softens hesitantly.\n\n          ANA\n          Hello, Duke...\n          Then she round house kicks him with her boot across the face,\n          knocks him out on his ass.\n\n          ANA (CONT'D)\n          You have to admit you had that\n          coming.\n          Ana struggles with something going on inside her head. Then\n          her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the\n          first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.\n\n          ANA (CONT'D)\n          Good-bye, Duke.\n          Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something\n          behind Duke. It's a \"HOWLER\" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the\n          scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees\n          to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump\n          to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-\n          ass.\n          A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and\n          lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he\n          draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he\n          glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far\n          away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.\n          BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in\n          the space of six breathless seconds.\n          Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES\n          sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking\n          Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass\n          defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse\n          burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,\n          his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE\n          BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:\n\n          DUKE\n          Air Force.. .right.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17.\n          A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips\n          through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA\n          \"SCARLETT\" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,\n          holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL. She lines up on\n          another Viper, but he's too quick, ducks behind the GRIZZLY.\n          But Scarlett's CROSSBOW PISTOL viewfinder snapped an image of\n          his FACE ARMOR. She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-\n          Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's\n          LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other\n          direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns\n          around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,\n          the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.\n          Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but\n          LAMONT \"HEAVY DUTY\" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler\n          holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER. Only a man this\n          big can carry such a weapon.\n\n          HEAVY DUTY\n          Time to lay down some bass!\n          He fires a grenade and the Viper flies back OUT OF FRAME. You\n          blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,\n          but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE\n          THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS\n          whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging\n          awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.\n          The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.\n          The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS\n          and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the\n          recovering Typhoon. Duke races after her through a hail of\n          pulse-fire and draws his PISTOL.\n\n          DUKE\n          Ana!\n          She whirls around, drawing the weapons case over her chest\n          and face, using it as a shield. Duke hesitates, because of\n          the warheads or Ana? Heavy Duty goes to shoot at her.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          The warheads!\n          Heavy Duty reluctantly doesn't shoot, everyone watching Ana\n          backpedal towards the waiting Typhoon. Duke charges like a\n          bull and tackles her. Ana sprawls and the case tumbles free.\n          Duke and Ana go eye-to-eye for a split second, then Duke goes\n          after the case while the Joes take the opportunity to spray\n          gunfire her way. Ana zigs, zags, and dives into the Typhoon,\n          which is raked by the bullets.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          18.\n          Duke grabs up the case as the Typhoon launches into the sky\n          and disappears over a rise ...\n          SILENCE... Scarlett, Snake-eyes and Heavy Duty now approach\n          Duke, who whirls around at them, pistol up, eyes wild.\n\n          DUKE\n          Stand down!

This\n          was supposed to be the easy part.\n\n          ANA\n          If you'd let me stage the assault\n          at your precious factory, we could\n          have contained the situation.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          And lost the trust of our clients\n          in the process? It had to be NATO's\n          fault.\n          (steps closer)\n          What happened? Did you hesitate?\n\n          ANA\n          You're implying this was about some\n          ancient history? That's as\n          laughable as your Intel. What went\n          wrong was the Joes appearing out of\n          nowhere.\n          He stares at her suspiciously, then softens.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Forgive me, jealousy isn't my\n          strong suit.\n\n          ANA\n          Forget that, where are we now? Have\n          you tracked the case?\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          They deactivated the beacon. I gave\n          them a code to quietly re-arm it.\n          McCullen hits a key, a SCREEN switches on, displaying A MAP\n          OF THE WORLD. A BEACON LIGHT flashes over a spot in the\n          Egyptian desert, grip coordinates blinking.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          There it is. The infamous Pit.\n\n          ANA\n          I will get those warheads back.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          30.\n          McCullen steps forward and lovingly caresses her face, his\n          hand going right through her. McCullen whispers menacingly.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          I hope so.\n\n          ANA\n          (diffusing the threat)\n          If I were really there, I might\n          actually let you touch me.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          (sly smile)\n          I'll send a jet.\n\n          ANA\n          Business first. Besides, I'm\n          married, remember?\n          Her holo-form blinks off, leaving McCullen alone in the room.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Sometimes I really hate technology.\n          He sighs heavily, then hears a VOICE:\n\n          STORM SHADOW (O.S.)\n          It is most often used by those\n          without honor.\n          McCullen turns to see STORM SHADOW, a well-tailored Korean\n          man whose soul has long since departed, standing on the other\n          side of the room.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          There can't be any more mistakes.\n          The schedule can't be compromised\n          any further.\n\n          STORM SHADOW\n          If you had sent me, it would be\n          done.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          (walking towards him)\n          I'm sending you now, Storm Shadow.\n          To the Baroness's villa. .Make\n          sure her commitment doesn't waiver.\n          Storm Shadow nods, McCullen continues on THROUGH him. We now\n          realize Storm Shadow was a holo-proj. Storm Shadow vanishes.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          31.\n          McCullen steps up to a large oval perspex window. WE PULL\n          BACK out of the window to reveal that he's riding through\n          DEEP ARCTIC OCEAN inside a next-gen \"TRIDENT\" submarine.\n          CAMERA KEEPS PULLING BACK to show the Trident approaching the\n          docking bay of a MASSIVE FACILITY built into the seabed under\n          the jagged canopy of the POLAR ICE CAP. The place is defended\n          by several HARPOON CANNONS and a fearsome TURBO-LASER. It's a\n          breath-taking sight, but also a little frightening.\n\n          INT. DOCKING BAY - DAY\n\n          The MARS LOGO is stamped on a pair of WATER-TIGHT DOORS. The\n          logo pulls apart as the doors open, allowing McCullen inside\n          the docking back entrance. Waiting for him is a man known\n          only as THE DOCTOR. His face hidden by a life-support mask\n          that continually pumps air into his lungs and also\n          mechanically helps him to speak without the vocal chords he\n          is missing.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          Welcome back.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Good to be back.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          we've been very busy.\n          He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all\n          standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them.\n          These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          Is it working?\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          You tell me.\n          The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a\n          glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the\n          Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          The King Cobra is a magnificent\n          creature. Its venom can kill a\n          full grown elephant with a single\n          bite.\n          He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing\n          its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows\n          McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          32.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          We introduced into each subject one\n          thousand cc's of the nano-mite\n          solution. As expected, subjects\n          became extremely ill and fell into\n          a coma-like state for approximately\n          forty hours.\n          The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket,\n          A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          When they returned to sentience,\n          brain scans showed complete\n          inactivity in the self-preservation\n          region of the cortex.\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          English, Doctor.\n          The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps\n          up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          They feel no fear.\n          The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites\n          his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The\n          Neo-Viper doesn't even wince.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          Cortical nerve clusters revealed\n          complete inactivity--\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          --Doctor.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          They feel no pain.\n          The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently\n          lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          Frontal lobe concepts of morality\n          are disengaged... No remorse...\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          And they are completely obedient?\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          Of course. .The real world\n          applications are endless.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          33.\n          The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously.\n          WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE\n          VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)\n          The nano-mites will target the\n          venom.\n          STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES\n          rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it.\n          Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original\n          fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off\n          the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in\n          line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          So you tell me: is it working?\n\n          INT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n          The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          The science is staggering isn't it?\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          You've done well. You've thrown the\n          caber clear out of the yard.\n\n          THE DOCTOR\n          But research and science are\n          expensive propositions. If I can\n          make a suggestion..?\n          McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly\n          menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask.\n\n          THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)\n          Selling one batch of warheads on\n          the black market could fund--\n\n          MCCULLEN\n          --I appreciate your thirst for\n          knowledge, Doctor. But this world\n          is messy enough. Factions fighting\n          and scrabbling for control, for\n          resources, and it's only going to\n          get worse as the century\n          progresses.

This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change\n          Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          My family was once this close to\n          that kind of power...\n\n          (LAUGHS)\n          The French...\n          Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen\n          looks back at the Doctor.\n\n          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n          Once I get my hands on the reins,\n          the money will take care of itself.\n          You'll be able to do all the\n          research you want.\n          McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him.\n\n          INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT\n\n          Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA\n          from the ambush, now up on a monitor.\n\n          BREAKER\n          We grabbed an image from Heavy-\n          Duty's helmet cam.\n          Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Hey, that's--\n          Duke cuts him off with a look.

Ana\n          Stands alone in her room now, she heads over to her dresser\n          and opens a hidden drawer. Inside is a SMALL BOX. She opens\n          it carefully and gazes at an ENGAGEMENT RING inside.\n          Something sad and lonely in her eyes... And WE FLASHBACK TO:\n\n          INT. MILITARY CLUB - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT\n\n          A crowded military club. OFFICERS and ENLISTED dancing to an\n          orchestra. And there's Ana, the most beautiful woman in the\n          room. Wearing a black dress. Slightly younger and with none\n          of the cold viciousness she displayed earlier. She's dancing\n          with Duke who's wearing his officer's DRESS UNIFORM, replete\n          with bars and medals. She laughs as Duke whispers something\n          in her ear. She's in love. And so is he.\n          Ripcord is in a booth, downing shots with four ENLISTED\n          WOMEN. He has his arms around two of them and looks loaded.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          My hot tub only holds four.\n\n          (COUNTS)\n          No, five.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          40.\n\n          EXT. VERANDAH - OFFICER'S CLUB - FLASHBACK - NIGHT\n\n          Duke leads Ana outside onto a quiet verandah, the lights of\n          Washington shimmering beyond them. He suddenly kneels down\n          in front of her, an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box in his hand.\n          Ana gasps with shock and joy, tears welling in her eyes.\n\n          DUKE\n          I've been wanting to do this before\n          we deploy.\n\n          ANA\n          Duke...it's beautiful.

He threads the ring onto\n          her trembling finger. Rex smiles, but in his eyes is a glint\n          of instability. Ripcord comes CRASHING OUT through shuttered\n          doors and sprawls out next to them, arms and legs akimbo.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          Jesus, Rip.\n          Ripcord rolls over and yells back through the doors:\n\n          RIPCORD\n          How was I supposed know she was\n          married!?\n          (then, notices the ring)\n          Nice rock!

Ripcord glances at Heavy Duty.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          I just missed everything you said.\n          (turns to Duke)\n          How do I look? Pretty cool, huh?\n\n          INT. TARGET RANGE - URBAN COMBAT LEVEL - DAY\n\n          Duke and Ripcord run through and URBAN ENVIRONMENT OBSTACLE\n          COURSE, 3D HOLO-PROJECTION TERRORISTS lunging out at them.\n          The guys take them out one by one, never more than a split\n          second after they appear. The HOLO-PROJECTIONS fritz and\n          die. They reach the end of the and a BUZZER SOUNDS.

She holds his gaze, slaps a magazine\n          into her CROSSBOW PISTOL and hands it to him.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Here. Go on. Try it.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          I wouldn't want to show you up.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Oh, that's so thoughtful of you.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          What can I tell you?

He glances aside at Duke\n          who is loving this. Ripcord readies the pistol. Scarlett\n          darts left. He shoots and misses. She darts right. He\n          misses.\n\n          DUKE\n          C'mon, Rip.\n          Ripcord tries harder, genuinely doing his best. But Scarlett\n          us too fast. Ducking and weaving around Ripcord, as nimble\n          as a cat. Five more shots miss her. And now Ripcord's\n          feeling the pressure. He waits for her to move. Fires. She\n          leaps up onto a corner wall and the bolt passes underneath.\n          He fires again as she lands, ducks under it and rolls up to\n          him. He fires his last bolt point blank. She catches it in\n          her left hand by the stem as it leaves the chamber. Slamming\n          her body up against his. Right hand behind his head, left\n          hand holding the bolt. Their faces close. Lips closer.\n          Ripcord's eyes on hers as he whispers:\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Guess you didn't really want me\n          that bad, rip.\n          She holds his eyes a moment longer, then lets him go. As she\n          walks away, Scarlett casually tosses the ARROW, it hits the\n          ground and EXPLODES. Ripcord and Duke jump back. Ripcord\n          glances at the underside of the pistol's magazine. Three\n          words: \"CAUTION: LIVE BOLTS\".\n          Both men watch Scarlett saunter back to the beginning of the\n          course, awestruck. Breaker walks by eating a burrito and\n          watching his bio-rhythm display.\n\n          BREAKER\n          Aw, Ripcord's heart just skipped a\n          beat.

THE PIT - DESERT - NIGHT\n\n          The HERDSMAN walks across the desert with his CAMELS under a\n          FULL MOON and a field of glittering stars. All of a sudden,\n          MULTIPLE MOUNDS OF SAND whip past his feet, almost knocking\n          him over. He stares at them as they abruptly disappear\n          deeper under the sand, like diving submarines.\n\n          INT.

TRAINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n          Ripcord and the other Joes watch as Duke and Snake-Eyes\n          circle one another with special ELECTRIFIED PUGIL STICKS.\n          Duke thrusts with a standard bayonet style move, Snake-Eyes\n          side steps it, spins his pugil stick above his head and\n          brings it down on Duke's head with a sword-like stroke. A\n          CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down. The Joes\n          grimace, feeling Duke's pain. Snake-Eyes turns away, done\n          with him. Duke pops back up again.\n\n          DUKE\n          Again.\n          They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified\n          pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts\n          a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes\n          blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down\n          hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again,\n          the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off\n          and pops to his feet once more.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          Again.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          47.\n          Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This\n          time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the\n          sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and\n          STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a\n          dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before\n          Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his\n          stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both\n          receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but\n          Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.\n          This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room,\n          Hawk watches with approval.\n\n          INT.

Another huge drill bursts out, it\n          retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.\n          They look around.

No going under.\n          Ten Neo-Viper mole pods start to burst out the wall.\n          And then there's a crashing sound as one of the wall girders\n          bends, obviously a mole machine in the clay behind it hit it.\n          Ana can hear the engine grind to a halt.\n\n          ANA (CONT'D)\n          If we don't get him out he'll\n          suffocate.\n          Storm Shadow gives her a look: Like I care?\n\n          ANA (CONT'D)\n          Just thought I'd mention it.\n\n          STORM SHADOW\n          All that matters is the mission.\n          Ana pulls out a hi-tech SCANNING DEVICE which shoots out six\n          STEEL BLUE BEAMS in a 360 DEGREE ARC, creating a DETAILED\n          SCHEMATIC of the Pit, showing rooms and people moving about\n          them. She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.\n          Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man\n          immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS\n          him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts\n          climbing the fence.

Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without\n          hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is\n          immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.\n          This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and\n          crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF\n          SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.\n          Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.\n\n          INT. PIT BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n          An area where the Joe team chills. Duke and Ripcord enter,\n          sore and worked over. They move to some couches. Heavy Duty\n          grooves to the blasting Reggaeton classic \"Salio El Sol\".\n\n          HEAVY DUTY\n          You can learn a whole hell of a lot\n          about a girl by the way she dances.\n          Tell me I'm wrong Snake-Eyes.\n          Snake-Eyes, sharpening his sword, barely looks up.\n\n          HEAVY DUTY (CONT'D)\n          See? He agrees.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          No, he doesn't. Do you?\n          This time Snake-eyes looks up, his expression unreadable.\n\n          SCARLETT (CONT'D)\n          See, he knows you have to listen to\n          get to know someone. Right, Rip?\n          Rip is happily stowing his liquid armor gear, glances over.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          What? You say something?\n          Breaker sits at a chessboard. Heavy D sits across from him.\n\n          BREAKER\n          Sorry, Scarlett, gotta go with\n          Heavy D on this one.\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          49.\n\n          BREAKER (CONT'D)\n          Like my man says, get a girl on the\n          floor, you don't just see how she\n          moves, you get the smell of her.\n          What biologists tell us is that the\n          decision is made by he nose long\n          before the rest of the body gets\n          involved. It's a question of\n          pheromones.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          You're going to teach me science?\n          I read all about the positron\n          emission tomography studies\n          concerning sex pheromones when I\n          was twelve. I'm just saying, it's\n          not very romantic.\n          Rip whispers to Duke, nodding towards Scarlett.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Heavy told me she graduated college\n          at twelve.\n          No response from Duke, who is trying to get comfortable.\n\n          RIPCORD (CONT'D)\n          She's like a freaky genius. A\n          deadly, freaky genius.\n\n          DUKE\n          You like her, I get it already.\n\n          BREAKER\n          (making a chess move)\n          You can't learn this stuff in a\n          book, Scarlett. You have to at\n          least kiss a guy, before you're an\n          expert on romance.\n          The guys all laugh. Scarlett blushes, then raises her bow.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Who am I shooting first?\n          The laughter stops. Rip looks surprised.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          You haven't kissed anyone?\n          Now Scarlett looks really furious. Rip instantly wishes he\n          could take his words back. Duke just shakes his head.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          50.\n\n          DUKE\n          Really firing on all cylinders\n          there, Rip.\n\n          HEAVY DUTY\n          All I know is, when the bass get's\n          that booty shaking in the right\n          way, I'm in the skin like a man\n          named Flynn.\n          Heavy Duty does a little freak dance. Scarlett makes a show\n          of disgust. Ripcord watches Scarlett, then makes a decision.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Hell with it.\n          He strides across the room toward Scarlett. Breaker notices.\n\n          BREAKER\n          (to no one in particular)\n          Into the Valley of Death rode the\n\n          600.\n          Heavy Duty looks at him, confused. Breaker nods to Ripcord,\n          stopping near Scarlett's chair. Ripcord sees Snake-Eyes\n          taking in his every move. Scarlett now has her nose in a\n          book. Ripcord CLEARS HIS THROAT but she doesn't look up. He\n          peers closer and WE SEE THE COVER, on which, though in\n          English, is a damn near INDECIPHERABLE SCIENTIFIC TITLE.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Beach reading, huh?\n          She groans and lowers the book only slightly.\n\n          RIPCORD (CONT'D)\n          Hi, I guess we kinda got off on the\n          wrong foot...\n          Without changing expression she goes back to her book.\n\n          RIPCORD (CONT'D)\n          Okay look, I'm attracted to you.\n          And you, you're attracted to me.\n          And him--\n          (nods towards Snake-Eyes)\n          The Zen Master, he creeps me out,\n          but what I'm saying is--\n\n          SCARLETT\n          \"We're attracted to one another.\"\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          51.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Thank you.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          That's what you're saying, not what\n          I'm saying.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Okay, what are you saying?\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Attraction is an emotion. Emotions\n          are not based in science. And if\n          you can't quantify or prove that\n          something exists, well, in my\n          mind... it doesn't.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Okay, I'll get back to you on that.\n          And he walks away scratching his head.

But we still need\n          to see if you pass muster in the\n          field.\n          Hawk gives them a nod. Duke and rip nod back with pride.\n\n          HEAVY DUTY\n          YO JOE! Welcome aboard, boyz!\n\n          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n          Ana, Storm Shadow and the Neo-Vipers creep down the hallway.\n          Two GI JOE GUARDS come around a corner, before they can even\n          react, Storm Shadow practically cuts them in two with his\n          Katana sword. Ana Directs them down another hallway.\n\n          INT. HAWK'S STATEROOM - NIGHT\n\n          A DOOR reads, \"General Hawk\". Cover Girl walks up and\n          knocks. As she waits, we see a SHADOW moving behind her.\n          Hawk opens the door. She hands him her POWERBOOK and a\n\n          STYLUS.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          52.\n\n          COVER GIRL\n          Sorry to disturb you, general.\n\n          HAWK\n          That's all right, Cover Girl. What\n          am I signing now?\n          Cover Girl GASPS, a KATANA BLADE piercing out through her\n          chest. She drops lifelessly, revealing Storm Shadow behind\n          her. Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two\n          swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the\n          other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana\n          steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his\n          jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave. He glances\n          at a RED BUTTON under his desk and struggles to reach it,\n          giving everything he's got, until he finally hits the button.\n\n          INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n          A KLAXON BLARES. Duke, Ripcord and all the Joes leap up.\n\n          DUKE\n          The warheads.\n          They all rush out of the doors. Breaker stops to change a\n          chess piece on the board before racing out.\n\n          INT. MAIN VAULT - NIGHT\n\n          Ana swipes Hawk's SECURITY BADGE across the lock of the VAULT\n          DOOR. It opens.\n          The weapons case sits on a table. She opens the case to\n          check that the four warheads are inside, they shine on her\n          glasses.\n\n          INT. MAIN VAULT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Duke and Ripcord reach the main vault, armed only with their\n          pistols. They find the INNER VAULT DOOR ajar. They\n          approach, pushing back the door to discover that the place is\n          empty and the weapons case is gone.\n\n          DUKE\n          They can't be far.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          53.\n\n          INT. URBAN AREA - NIGHT\n\n          Some of the Neo-Vipers now reach the MOLE PODS and begin\n          prepping them for escape. BOOM! A GRENADE slams into them,\n          killing them and destroying the pods. It's Heavy Duty with\n          his \"MPL\". Ana enters the room and quick-draws her PULSE\n          PISTOL and blasts away. Heavy Duty dives behind cover, which\n          is blown away, knocking him out cold.\n          Storm Shadow examines the ruined MOLE PODS, glancing around,\n          his eyes falling on a pair of \"ARCLIGHT\" JET PACKS mounted on\n          a wall rack nearby. Storm Shadow strides to the nearest one\n          and puts it on. Ana heads after him, still carrying the\n          case. Suddenly, Duke and Ripcord rush up behind them, guns\n          raised.\n\n          DUKE\n          Put the case down, Ana,\n          Rip trains his gun on Storm Shadow.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          And you get out of that...thing.\n          Stalemate. Storm Shadow doesn't move. Ana turns and looks\n          at Duke. Sets the case down, her voice is gentle.\n\n          ANA\n          Fine. Done.\n          Then she takes a step toward Duke.\n\n          DUKE\n          Stop, Ana. Stop right there.\n          But she doesn't. She just keeps slowly moving toward him.\n\n          ANA\n          You can't shoot me, can you?\n\n          DUKE\n          I will if I have to.\n\n          ANA\n          Deep down, you're still the same\n          man I fell in love with.\n\n          DUKE\n          Don't force this, Ana.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          54.\n\n          ANA\n          What could have been, right, Duke?\n          You beside your best man. Me\n          walking down the aisle.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Don't listen to her, Duke.\n          (a thought)\n          Was I really going to be your best\n          man?\n\n          DUKE\n          (cocking the pistol)\n          Don't make me do this god-damnit!\n\n          ANA\n          \"Don't make me do this?\" A\n          recurring theme in your life, right\n          Duke?\n          She takes another step. Duke levels his pistol right at her\n          forehead. Storm Shadow flinches. Duke gives him a glance.\n\n          DUKE\n          Move and I'll blow her away.\n          (to Ripcord)\n          Get the briefcase.\n          Ana takes another step forward, daring Duke to pull the\n          trigger. Ripcord, gun drawn and fixed on Storm Shadow, moves\n          slowly forward to retrieve the briefcase. Ana is now an inch\n          from the extended barrel. Ana and Duke are close enough to\n          feel each other's breath. Their eyes lock.\n\n          ANA\n          Do it, Duke. .You already killed\n          me once.\n          And in Duke's eyes we see him falter, just a bit. Ripcord\n          passes Ana, and wit hone lightning quick hand she slaps at\n          Duke's pistol. AN ERRANT SHOT GOES OFF. Storm Shadow lunges\n          at ripcord, SLICING his pistol in half with one sword and\n          about to kill him with the other.\n          When suddenly, Snake-Eyes lunges INTO FRAME. CLANG! Snake-\n          Eyes' KATANA BLADE saves Ripcord's life by a half inch.\n          The rest of the Neo-Vipers arrive and immediately open fire,\n          pinning both Duke and Ripcord down. All hell breaks loose.\n          Snake-Eyes and Storm Shadow lunge at one another, swords\n          flashing at impossible speeds, then they lock swords. Face-\n          to-face, staring hard into each other's eyes.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          55.\n          Snake-Eyes glances at Storm Shadow's right forearm, spotting\n          the same RED MARKINGS of his ninja clan underneath his suit\n          sleeve. This shocks the hell out of Snake-Eyes. Storm\n          Shadow smiles.\n\n          STORM SHADOW\n\n          (CYNICAL)\n          Hello brother.\n          Snake-Eyes looks shocked. Storm Shadow uses the moment to\n          elbow him in the face, knocking him hard to the ground. Ana\n          grabs the weapons case as Scarlett rushes in, aiming her\n\n          CROSSBOW PISTOL.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          I believe you've got my luggage.\n          Ana stares at Scarlett, then quick-draws a PULSE PISTOL. Her\n          shot tears the CROSSBOW PISTOL out of Scarlett's hands.\n          Ana's got her dead-to-rights until Scarlett triggers her CAMO-\n          SUIT, melting into nothing right in front of Ana.\n          Ana doesn't spot the RIPPLES OF AIR around her until she's\n          stuck hard. The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her\n          pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but\n          that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.\n          Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but\n          Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.\n          Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers. Storm Shadow\n          climbs back into the Arclight. Looking at ana as she falls\n          near a vehicle on the blocks. Ana grabs an OIL PAN and\n          flings the oil, which sprays over everything, including\n          Scarlett, making her visible. Ana leaps on Scarlett, knocks\n          her to the ground and angrily begins to choke the life out of\n          her.\n          Storm Shadow ignites the Arclight which jumps into the air,\n          powered by an arc of blue light shooting out of its engine\n          pack. He quickly swoops towards the two women and grabs ana\n          by her arm, pulling her along. Ana grabs the weapons case\n          and they soar up out of the motor pool and over the landing\n          pad. The battle raging below them.\n          Ripcord and Duke fire after them, but they vanish up into the\n          next level. Heavy Duty, now back in action, takes out the\n          last of the Neo-Vipers. Snake-Eyes checks on Scarlett who's\n          nursing her neck.\n\n          INT.

SECURITY ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT\n\n          They fly into the security room and quickly dispatch the few\n          technicians still alive. Ana his the large switch on the\n          console and the huge door begins to spiral open. She jumps\n          back into Storm Shadow's arms and they blast back out--\n\n          EXT.

OPERATING CHAMBER - DAY\n\n          In the shadowy operating chamber, the Doctor approaches\n          Zartan who sits on a gurney, scanning his PDA.

He remains conscious, not feeling any pain.\n          WE ZOOM into a LARGE NEEDLE which OPENS an INCISION behind\n          his right ear. The needle feeds thousands of tiny NANO-MITES\n          into Zartan's head. Zartan's eyes bulge, he starts to SCREAM\n          and fight his restraints as the nano-mites begin to reshape\n          his appearance, reforming facial bones and changing the\n          texture and elasticity of his skin and even changing the\n          color of his eyes. The Doctor grins proudly. McCullen looks\n          disturbed.\n\n          INT. URBAN AREA - THE PIT - DAY\n\n          Joes are busy cleaning up the mess.

As he\n          takes a first bite, another young boy enters, we see the RED\n          CLAN MARKINGS on his forearm, it's a young Storm Shadow,\n          healthy, wealthy, and well fed.\n\n          YOUNG STORM SHADOW\n          Thief !\n          He picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE and tries to cut Young Snake-\n          Eyes, who blocks the strike with the rice pot. They fight\n          fiercely for two little kids, using all sorts of utensils and\n          furniture. Snake-Eyes has desperate street skills, but Storm\n          Shadow's classic training gives him the edge. He finally\n          traps Snake-Eyes under his foot, a triumphant look on his\n          face.

BARRACKS - NIGHT\n\n          Battered and bruised, Scarlett hurriedly enters the barracks.\n          Checks around to see that she's alone. Then she heads for a\n          mirror over one of the sinks, peeling back her collar to\n          check the CHOKE MARKS on her neck. Her hands are trembling.\n          She turns on the water and cleans her face with a WASH CLOTH.\n          Ripcord enters the barracks behind. Like Scarlett, he looks\n          around to see if he's alone. He catches Scarlett looking at\n          him in the mirror, as if he's unwanted. Then he notices the\n          choke marks. He is genuinely concerned.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Jesus, you okay?\n\n          SCARLETT\n          I'm fine.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          You're not fine, let me look at\n          that.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          61.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          I looked at it, it's fine.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Take it easy, just trying to help.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          I know what you're trying to do.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          And what is that exactly?\n\n          SCARLETT\n          I don't have time for this.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          You know, not every guy you meet is\n          an asshole.

Then she fires at\n          Snake-Eyes and Scarlett. Snake-Eyes dives, but the blasts\n          nail Scarlett. She crashes hard. Snake-Eyes glances at her.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          Keep going!\n          With that, he leaps after the Scarab, just grabbing the back\n          of the vehicle as it tears away.

RAILWAY CROSSING - CITY STREETS - DAY\n\n          Duke and Ripcord's visors lift, both looking a bit wigged.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          77.\n\n          DUKE\n          What happened to you?\n\n          RIPCORD\n          I went through the train.

Storm\n          Shadow is incredibly beat and bloody, but Ana is just fine in\n          her red Accelerator Suit. Storm Shadow grabs the weapons\n          case and he and Ana leap out.\n          Duke and Ripcord pick themselves up while Snake-Eyes crawls\n          out of the TRASH CANS nearby. They see Storm Shadow and Ana\n          emerge from the Scarab and hurry off towards the tower.\n\n          DUKE (CONT'D)\n          C'mon!\n          Snake-Eyes follows Duke and Ripcord, charging after them.\n\n          EXT. EIFFEL TOWER - DAY\n\n          HUNDREDS OF TOURISTS swarm around the south base of the tower\n          to buy their tickets and start their tours. Storm Shadow and\n          Ana burst through them, slamming past SECURITY GUARDS as they\n          bound onto the stairs. People scream at the sight of Ana.\n          Duke and Ripcord arrive seconds later, rushing up in their\n          Accelerator Suits like beings from another world. They spot\n          Ana and Storm Shadow on the stairs and hurry after them. The\n          Security Guards draw their pistols and start SHOOTING at Duke\n          and Ripcord. The BULLETS ping off their suits.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          (to Duke)\n          How do you say \"we're the good\n          guys\" in French?\n          Meanwhile, Snake-Eyes evades all the chaos by leaping up\n          under the south base, scaling the iron lattice like a monkey.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          78.\n          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow crest the stairs\n          and rudely push through the crowd to the stairway on the\n          opposite side of the floor. Another SECURITY GUARD draws a\n          gun on them but Storm Shadow snatches the weapon out of the\n          man's hands, swatting him with the butt, all without missing\n          a step. The crowd panics and runs screaming for the stairs--\n          --where Duke and Ripcord are struggling to catch up. The\n          avalanche of tourists slows their progress. Underneath the\n          stairway, however, Snake-Eyes continues to climb fast without\n          a safety net. He makes it to the first floor and races after\n          Ana and Storm Shadow.\n          ON THE GROUND: The Brawler screeches up. Scarlett's first\n          out with Breaker and Heavy Duty behind her. All of them\n          carrying weapons. The Security Guards instantly go on the\n          defensive as they hurry up to the stairway. Guns go up.\n          Scarlett speaks to them urgently in French.\n\n          SCARLETT\n          (French, subtitled)\n          Don't shoot! We're a special anti-\n          terrorist unit! There's a bomb up\n          there!\n          POLICE CARS are now rushing up behind them.\n          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: Ana and Storm Shadow speed over to the\n          main tower ELEVATOR and barge their way inside. Storm Shadow\n          hurls the ELEVATOR OPERATOR out as Ana opens the weapons case\n          and removes one of the NANOTECH WARHEADS and its KILL SWITCH.\n          Through the stunned crowd, they see Snake-Eyes reach the top\n          of the stairs behind. Ana rolls the warhead towards him\n          while Storm Shadow lines up on him with the Security Guard's\n          pistol as if to shoot him. Snake-Eyes glares defiantly at\n          Storm Shadow who just grins and lowers his gun at the\n          warhead.\n          A SINGLE SHOT AND THE WARHEAD EXPLODES. Snake-Eyes recoils.\n          ON THE GROUND: Everyone hears the warhead detonate.\n          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: Duke and Ripcord freeze.\n          ON THE SECOND FLOOR: A BURST OF NANO-MITES spreads out in\n          all directions. Storm Shadow closes the ELEVATOR DOORS and\n          hits a button for the top. The elevator races upwards as\n          everything else gets eaten by the ravenous NANO-MITES. The\n          floor begins to disappear. Tourists stampede towards the\n          stairs. A LITTLE GIRL is thrown from her MOTHER'S GRIP. The\n          mother screams out for her child as the girl goes over the\n          railing.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          79.\n          ON THE FIRST FLOOR: a hundred feet up, Duke and Rip see her\n          coming. Ripcord swings out and catches the girl just in\n          time. Above them, the tower is dissolving before their eyes.\n          Duke sees Snake-Eyes being pushed down the stairs by the\n          tourists. He leaps up onto the iron lattice.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          Where you going?\n\n          DUKE\n          Each warhead has a kill switch.\n\n          RIPCORD\n          It's too late!

Rip things about following, but then looks at the\n          little girl in his arms, who smiles and hugs him. Snake-Eyes\n          grabs him and they join the flow of people down the stairs.\n          The NANO-MITES chasing them close behind. Below them,\n          Scarlett, Breaker, and Heavy Duty are helping the police\n          evacuate the Tower.\n          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR: Ana and Storm Shadow race to the top.\n\n          ANA\n          (into mike)\n          Be ready to pick up in thirty\n          seconds.\n          IN THE SKIES: The Typhoon gunship rockets towards the top of\n          the disintegrating Eiffel Tower, its SIDE DOOR opening.\n          ON THE TOWER: Duke scales the tower, the NANO-MITES chasing\n          him up. His eyes on the elevator as it reaches the top deck\n          just above him. The Typhoon fires a blast of its CONCUSSION\n          CANNONS at Duke, knocking him off the tower. He falls, but\n          manages to catch the tower just below, the NANO-MITES almost\n          on top of him now. The climbs even faster.\n          ON THE TOP DECK: The elevator arrives. Ana and Storm Shadow\n          calmly walk out and climb the railing as the Typhoon hovers\n          up beside them. Below them, Duke sees them board. The tower\n          groans and wobbles. It's a long way down.

Duke springs\n          inside. He smacks Storm Shadow down and grabs the KILL\n          SWITCH from Ana, pressing the trigger.\n          Immediately, the NANO-MITES pulse with light and fall to the\n          ground around the Eiffel Tower.\n          The Tower groans, half-eaten, then topples over on its side.\n          Ripcord and Snake-Eyes scurry out of the way as it crashes\n          down onto the Seine, sending up an enormous explosion of\n          water. The shock on the faces of everyone around\n          reverberates through the entire Joe team. Ripcord keeps his\n          eyes on the Typhoon as it pulls away. Breaker suddenly gets\n          an idea.\n\n          BREAKER\n          Come on!\n          He hauls-ass.\n\n          INT.
