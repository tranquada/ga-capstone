PRISON GUARDS patrol outside with their pikes\n          as the SCREAMS OF PRISONERS echo out the barred windows.\n\n<b>          SUPER: PARIS, 1641\n</b>\n<b>          INT. PRISON BLOCK - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT\n</b>\n          A pair of huge PRISON GUARDS walk down a row of filthy prison\n          cells. Whimpering, starving PRISONERS appear and disappear in\n          the flickering light of the wall torches. A large rat nibbles\n          some stale bread in the corner, watching the guards.\n          Finally, the two guards reach a cell whose PRISONER is not at\n          all whimpering or starving. A huge Scotsman with a proud\n          defiance in his eyes, a RED SQUARE MEDALLION dangling around\n          his neck, glares through the bars. This is JAMES McCULLEN.\n          The guards unlock his cell door, MATCHLOCK MUSKETS at the\n          ready. McCullen stares at the muskets, unimpressed. He speaks\n          with a thick Scottish brogue.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN\n</b>          Still using matchlocks, are ya?

FURNACE - BASTILLE PRISON - NIGHT\n</b>\n          Huge, sweaty, bare-chested PRISON WORKERS mould something in\n          a furnace, a large chunk of metal in their red hot tongs. The\n          two prison guards muscle McCullen into the room and start to\n          fasten him to a standing rack as a PRIEST begins reciting the\n          Lord's Prayer in Latin. The Warden steps up and reads the\n          charges off a SCROLL OF PAPER.\n\n<b>          WARDEN\n</b>          James McCullen, you have been found\n          guilty of treason for the sale of\n          military arms to the enemies of our\n          Lord King Louis XIII... even whilst\n          you sold arms to our Lord himself.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN\n</b>          Your King is a vile bag of filth\n          who murders his own allies.

Clan McCullen is far\n          bigger and more powerful than any\n          of you could ever imagine. My sons\n          will continue to rise along after I\n          am gone. As will their sons. And,\n          God willing, their sons.\n\n<b>          (SMILES)\n</b>          It shall not end with my death.\n          The Warden smiles back sinisterly.\n\n<b>          WARDEN\n</b>          Oh, we're not going to kill you,\n          McCullen.

McCullen sees what it is\n          before we do and his face fills with fear. It's a METAL MASK\n          being carried towards him, the hinges open with a hideous\n          creak. McCullen begins to struggle against the rack.\n\n<b>          WARDEN (CONT'D)\n</b>          So that no man, woman, nor child\n          may ever see your treacherous face\n          again, you shall wear this mask for\n          the term of your natural life.\n          The mask closes around his face. The workers melt the lock.\n          McCullen SCREAMS. AND WE PUSH IN on the RED SQUARE MEDALLION.\n\n<b>          EXT.

BRIEFING CHAMBER - NATO HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n</b>\n          The RED SQUARE MEDALLION around the neck of JAMES McCULLEN,\n          gazing over a lectern in a darkened room. Like his doomed\n          ancestor, McCullen carries a proud defiance in his eyes.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN\n</b>          Tragic as they are to fight, wars\n          must be won. But perhaps they don't\n          have to be as destructive as\n          they've been in the past.\n          A SERIES OF COMPLEX SCHEMATICS rolls continuously on a screen\n          behind him. McCullen is briefing twenty-two NATO MILITARY\n          COMMANDERS, many of them listening in TRANSLATION HEADPHONES.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n</b>          Nano-mites.

The warhead bursts into millions of SILVER MICROSCOPIC\n          NANO-MITES which eat away the metal like piranhas devouring a\n          horse. Then the NANO-MITES fan out from the consumed tank and\n          quickly head for a nearby jeep.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n</b>          Once the target has been destroyed,\n          the launcher triggers a kill switch\n          unique to each warhead that short-\n          circuits the nano-mites, preventing\n          any unwanted destruction.\n          ON SCREEN: The Soldier hits a KILL SWITCH on the launcher and\n          the NANO-MITES instantly \"drop dead\" around the nearby jeep.\n\n<b>          MCCULLEN (CONT'D)\n</b>          Each warhead contains seven million\n          nano-mites and has the ability to\n          eat anything from a single tank to\n          an entire city.\n          (to consummate salesman)\n          But without innocent casualties.\n          Which is why this has been such a\n          priority for me and my company.\n          The room breaks into APPLAUSE. FOCUSES ON GENERAL HAWK, a\n          British veteran or countless battles, not buying it.\n\n<b>          HAWK\n</b>          Guess you'll be the first arms\n          dealer up for the Nobel Peace\n          Prize.\n          Laughter in the room.

The KILL SWITCHES are secured next\n          to each warhead. As the case is closed and locked we see the\n          MARS Industries RED SQUARE MEDALLION LOGO on its cover.\n\n<b>          SUPER: KYRGYZSTAN, CENTRAL ASIA\n</b>\n<b>          INT.

His NAME TAG simply reads: \"DUKE\". He loads his into\n          the mirror (is that a look of disdain?) and we get our first\n          glimpse of our hero, a handsome, rugged combat veteran with a\n          BATTLE SCAR under his right eye.\n          The sound of RETCHING comes from the stall behind Duke. There\n          is a flush and a strapping young Special Forces Soldier,\n          STALWORTH, steps out. He goes to the sink next to Duke and\n          splashes water on his face.

The Vipers fire back, the impact from their\n          pulse rifles crush the soldiers' bodies, armor and all, and\n          fling them backwards.\n          Two Soldiers pop two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES and toss them\n          toward the Typhoon.

Then\n          her face reluctantly hardens and she takes her hand off the\n          first Viper's gun barrel, giving Duke an apologetic look.\n\n<b>          ANA (CONT'D)\n</b>          Good-bye, Duke.\n          Duke can't believe it. Ana suddenly glances up at something\n          behind Duke. It's a \"HOWLER\" TRANSPORT rocketing onto the\n          scene, its four-winged JET THRUSTERS rotating ninety degrees\n          to slow it into a hover. Duke takes the opportunity to jump\n          to his feet and lay out in the Viper. Ana turns and hauls-\n          ass.\n          A BLACK-CLAD FIGURE fast ropes down out of the Howler and\n          lands behind a Viper and SNAPS his neck. Moving in a blur, he\n          draws and buries a KATANA BLADE into another Viper. Then he\n          glances at the last Viper who's lining up on him, too far\n          away to reach with his sword. He quick-draws a GLOCK PISTOL.\n          BAM! Right between the eye slit in his helmet. All this in\n          the space of six breathless seconds.\n          Duke glances at the almost mystical figure of SNAKE-EYES\n          sheathing his sword on his back while holstering his smoking\n          Glock. RED NINJA CLAN MARKING on his tri-cep. Bad-ass\n          defined. Snake-Eyes leaps behind the Cougar wreck as a pulse\n          burst just missed him. Duke immediately takes off after Ana,\n          his eyes locked on the weapons case in her hands, PULSE\n          BURSTS crackling past his head. He curses under his breath:\n\n<b>          DUKE\n</b>          Air Force.. .right.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          17.\n</b>          A Viper lines up on Duke, but a laser-like ARROW BOLT rips\n          through his eye-slit and ELECTROCUTES him, courtesy of SHANA\n          \"SCARLETT\" O'HARA who fast-ropes down from the Howler,\n          holding a gas-propulsion CROSSBOW PISTOL.

She darts behind the COUGAR WRECK with Snake-\n          Eyes, swiftly targeting the Viper's eye-slit on her pistol's\n          LED SCREEN. Then she fires behind her, in the complete other\n          direction to the Viper, the arrow bolt flies away, then turns\n          around and zeroes in on the Viper, finding him behind cover,\n          the smart-arrow slams right through his eye-slit.\n          Another Viper sees this and bolts toward the Typhoon, but\n          LAMONT \"HEAVY DUTY\" MORRIS leans out of the landing Howler\n          holding a dual MACHINE GUN/GRENADE LAUNCHER.

You\n          blink, you miss it. BOOM! The Typhoon fires at Heavy Duty,\n          but the Howler is just as nimble, fires its LEFT-SIDE\n          THRUSTERS which roll it onto its side. The CONCUSSION BLASTS\n          whip past and decimate the forest behind it. Hanging\n          awkwardly, Heavy Duty fires a double blast of hand grenades.\n          The Typhoon's mini-gun quickly shoots them out of the air.\n          The Howler fires MISSILES which hit the CONCUSSION CANNONS\n          and rip them apart. The Typhoon SHAKES. Ana races for the\n          recovering Typhoon.

A\n          CRACKLING SHOCK is delivered and Duke goes down. The Joes\n          grimace, feeling Duke's pain. Snake-Eyes turns away, done\n          with him. Duke pops back up again.\n\n<b>          DUKE\n</b>          Again.\n          They go at each other, fast and furious, the electrified\n          pugil sticks crackling and sparking. Duke spins and attempts\n          a stroke similar to Snake-Eyes' earlier move. Snake-Eyes\n          blocks it, drops, and sweeps Duke's feet, taking him down\n          hard before finishing him with another SPARKING HIT. Again,\n          the Joes react. Snake-Eyes turns away. Duke shakes it off\n          and pops to his feet once more.\n\n<b>          DUKE (CONT'D)\n</b>          Again.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          47.\n</b>          Snake-Eyes nods, a little more respect in his eyes now. This\n          time after the high blows are parried, Snake-Eyes tries the\n          sweep. Duke jumps it, rolls, comes up behind Snake-Eyes and\n          STRIKES. Snake-Eyes barely blocks it. They trade half a\n          dozen blows, the electricity popping and crackling before\n          Snake-Eyes tries a finishing blow. Duke stuffs it with his\n          stick and tackles Snake-Eyes. They fall to the ground, both\n          receiving JOLTS. They go eye-to-eye. It wasn't pretty, but\n          Duke is getting effective. Snake-Eyes pops to his feet.\n          This time he offers a hand to pull Duke up. Across the room,\n          Hawk watches with approval.\n\n<b>          INT. THE PIT'S GENERATOR STATION - NIGHT\n</b>\n          The huge drill bit of Ana's mole machine bursts out of the\n          reinforced clay wall, it opens and retracts, Ana rolls out\n          and drops to the ground. Another huge drill bursts out, it\n          retracts and opens and Storm Shadow drops to the ground.\n          They look around.

She points down a tunnel beyond the electrified fence.\n          Storm Shadow gestures to one of the Neo-Vipers. The Man\n          immediately walks over and grabs the fence, electricity JOLTS\n          him violently, but the man ignores it and shakily starts\n          climbing the fence.

Storm Shadow nods to the next Viper. Without\n          hesitation the Man walks over and grabs the fence. He is\n          immediately JOLTED, but keeps climbing, burning and bubbling.\n          This guy makes it to the top, throws himself over, and\n          crashes to the ground, then crawls over and pulls the OFF\n          SWITCH, cutting the electricity before dropping dead himself.\n          Ana, Storm Shadow and the others quickly scale the fence.\n\n<b>          INT.

Hawk grabs a PISTOL, but Storm Shadow flashes his two\n          swords. One slices the barrel of the pistol clean off, the\n          other buries itself in Hawk's gut. Hawk collapses. Ana\n          steps forward and rips the General's SECURITY BADGE off his\n          jacket. Hawk's eyes follow them as they leave.

The case goes flying. Another SMACK and her\n          pistol is knocked free. Ana grabs a second pistol, but\n          that's just as quickly twisted out of her grasp and dropped.\n          Ana fights the invisible Scarlett as best she can, but\n          Scarlett lands several unseen blows on her.\n          Ripcord and Duke take out a pair of Neo-Vipers.

Snake-Eyes draws his KATANA SWORD, its blade\n          shimmering in the laser-light as he redirects the laser back\n          into its module. Storm Shadow does the same with his sword,\n          barely saving his neck. They glare at each other.\n          AND WE FLASH CUT TO THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE, where the two 26\n          year-olds fight with katanas. Storm Shadow presses forward,\n          Snake-eyes side-steps and hurls Storm Shadow to the ground!\n          He steps up and puts his sword tip in Storm Shadow's eye.\n          Snake-Eyes first ever win over Storm Shadow.\n          Hard Master CLAPS ONE TIME.

This is it. The final\n          duel. Snake-Eyes struggles, exhausted and wounded. Storm\n          Shadow puts in every ounce of hate he has left. He finally\n          tears Snake-Eyes' sword away and kicks him down. About to go\n          for the final kill. But before we find out the climax to\n          their fight, we must finish their story:\n          ON THE ARISHIKAGE TEMPLE GROUNDS, Snake-Eyes, still 26, walks\n          along the pond. He hears a LOUD CRY. Snake-Eyes breaks into a\n          run, careens around a building and sees Hard Master slumped\n          on the ground, a sword in his back.\n\n<b>          SNAKE-EYES\n</b>          Master!\n          Other NINJAS come flooding in.\n\n<b>          NINJA #1\n</b>          That's Storm Shadow's sword!\n\n<b>          NINJA #2\n</b>          There!

FLASH BACK TO: THE ENERGY SHAFT where Snake-\n          Eyes is suddenly filled with renewed energy, he stares up at\n          Storm Shadow's katana blade poised for the final kill.\n\n<b>          STORM SHADOW\n</b>          You took your vow of silence to\n          avenge our Master. But now you will\n          die without a word.\n          The LOUD NOISE gears up again, distracting Storm Shadow for\n          just a beat. Snake-Eyes uses the moment to catch Storm shadow\n          with his feet, holding him up for a split second as the\n          ENERGY LASERS come back on. One of them burns deeply across\n          Storm Shadow's neck, he SCREAMS and stumbles back and falls\n          OVER THE EDGE and down into the freezing turgid waters. Snake-\n          Eyes steps up and looks down to see if he surfaces... He\n          doesn't.\n\n<b>          SNAKE-EYES\n</b>          Father always feared it would come\n          to this.\n          EXPLOSIONS begin to rock the shaft now.
