LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.\n\nSILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile \nafter mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to \nblack.\n\nAn old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the \ncontours of sand.\n\nA woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, \nszerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.\n\nINSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be \nasleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE \nPILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, \nbut we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's \nplaintive voice.\n\nThe plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN \nAND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks \nand armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.  \nThe glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An \nANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.\n\nShocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches \nviolently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the \ninstruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not \nconscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays \nthem both, then EXPLODES.\n\nTHE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both \nON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He \nlooks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries \nthem slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no \nsound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his \nface, his lover...\n\n\n2\tEXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.\n\nTHE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the \nwreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A \nSILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes \nacross A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The \nPilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious \nto this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists \nfrantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a \nlitter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.\n\n\n3\tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.\n\nThe Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.  \nHis view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses \ncamels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.\n\n\n4\tEXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.\n\nThe Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack \nand begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the \nPilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.  \nHe stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.  \nMouth to mouth.\n\n\n4a*.\tEXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.\n\nTHE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.\n\n\n5\tEXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.\n\nThe SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.\n\nAN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in \ndarkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to \nreveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF \nSMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could \nbe an angel.\n\nThe man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in \nthe protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR \nstands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep \ninto the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the \nsupport of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's \ntongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets \nabout peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's \nflesh.\n\nThe Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and \nMAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, \nhardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl \nhe'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned \nskin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and \nBEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us \nhumming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.\n\n\n6*.\tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.\n\nThe sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church \nbells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some \nsupply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is \nlargely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and \nsupply lines slowly following.\n\n\n7*.\tINT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.\n\nA young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana \npays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.  \nThis is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars \ncovers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid \ntattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the \neffect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes \nliquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He \ncoughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.\n\n\n8*.\tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.\n\nA JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck \ncontaining Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to \nsee it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, \none driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.\n\n\t\t\tJAN\n\t\tThere's meant to be lace in the next\n\t\tvillage - the boys are taking me.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'm not sewing anything else.\n\n\t\t\tJAN\n\t\t\t\t(mischievously)\n\t\tYou don't have any money, do you?  \n\t\tJust in case there's silk.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tNo!\n\n\t\t\tJAN\n\t\tHana, I know you do!\n\nHana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands - \nhers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side \nby side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the \nsun and glints.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'm not sewing anything else for you!\n\n\t\t\tJAN\n\t\t\t\t(getting the money)\n\t\tI love you.\n\nThe Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.\n\nSuddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.  \nThe jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as \nsoldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the \nother way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by \na soldier.\n\n\n9*.\tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.\n\n-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One \nof them, a SIKH, wears a turban.\n\nThe motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is \nhelping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two \nbodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh \nand his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal \nequipment.\n\n\n10\tEXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.\n\nKIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road \nahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and \nHEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch \nalong the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With \na bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something \nGLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA \nHURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that \nneither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tHey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tDon't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!\n\n Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\t\t\t(as he approaches)\n\t\tGood, that's good, just stay still for me\n\t\tand then we're going to be fine.\n\nHe arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tWhat are you doing?!  What the bloody \n\t\thell do you think you're doing?\n\nBy way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's \nBRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled \nbracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.\n\n\n11\tEXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.\n\nThe CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs \nof war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children, \ndejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of \none of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside \ndown with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration \nwith the Nazis.\n\n\n12\tINT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.\n\nHana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient \nswaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.\n\n\n13*.\tEXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.\n\nTHE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.  \nHana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to \nhim.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tDo you need something?\n\nThe Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a \nsmall kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief \nfor Jan's death.\n\n\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tAre you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were\n\t\tlike sisters.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\t\t\t(sighs angrily)\n\t\tWe keep moving him - in and out of the\n\t\ttruck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?\n\n\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tWell, we can't hardly leave him.  Do\n\t\tyou mean leave him?  We can't.\n\nHana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws \nherself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the \noutline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face \na frozen mask.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,\n\t\tanybody who gets close to me -\n\t\tor I must be cursed.  Which is it?\n\nThe Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.\n\n\n14\tEXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.\n\nHana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its \novergrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.\n\n\n15*.\tINT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.\n\nHana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have \ncollapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the \nshelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on \none side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which \ncovers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.\n\n\n15a*.\tINT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.\n\nPast the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.\n\n\n15b*.\tINT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.\n\nHana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two \nthirds of the way up.\n\n\n15c*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.\n\nShe comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an \naltar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an \nold bed, and a mattress.\n\n\n16\tEXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.\n\nHana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the \ngravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue \nthere's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING, \nsplashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this, \nenjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into \nthe water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.\n\n\n17\tEXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.\n\nThe Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the \nvehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some \nsacks of rice.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tThe war's over - you told me yourself.\n\t\tHow can it be desertion?\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tIt's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean\n\t\tliterally.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWhen he dies I'll catch up.\n\nOliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions, \nthen lays another blanket over the Patient.\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tIt's not safe here.  The whole country's\n\t\tcrawling with Bandits and Germans and God\n\t\tknows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.\n\t\tYou're not, this is natural - it's shock.  \n\t\tFor all of us.  Hana -\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\t\t\t(clutching at straws)\n\t\tAnd what if he really is a spy?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\t\t\t(impatiently)\n\t\tHe can't even move.\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tIf anything happened to you I'd never\n\t\tforgive myself.\n\nHana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tWe're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the\n\t\tItalians call it.  We'll expect you.\n\n\n18*.\tINT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.\n\nTWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the \nmonastery.  Hana indicates the stairs.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tUp there.\n\nThey struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly \navoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at \nwhich the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but \nstill clearly aristocratic.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tThere was a Prince, who was dying, and\n\t\the was carried up the tower at Pisa so he\n\t\tcould die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.\n\t\tAm I that Prince?\n\nHana laughs.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tBecause you're leaning?  No, you're \n\t\tjust on an angle.  You're too heavy!\n\nMary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the \nCHAPEL.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tIn here.\n\n\n18a*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.\n\nHana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away \nthe drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto \nthe bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tThank you.\n\nShe shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room, \nits faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter \nto let a fierce envelope of light into the room.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tGood.\n\n\tShe goes to Mary and hugs her.\n\n\n19*.\tINT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.\n\nA smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform, \nshe looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton \ndress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger \nand rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A \nVIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS \nAND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A \nNEW BEGINNING.\n\n\n19a*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.\n\nHANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The \nPatient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On \nthe track a song begins:  Some Other Time.\n\n\n20*.\tEXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.\n\nTHE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER \nMADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED \nTIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second \nEuropean, ALM\u00c1SY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the \ncamshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for \nAlmasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging \nin the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides \nand servants to the Alm\u00e1sy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole \ncontinent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other, \npursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.\n\nD'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane \nin one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out \ncarrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with \nhimself as he shows the jar to Alm\u00e1sy and then passes it to Madox.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tThirsty?\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\t\t\t(sniffing inside)\n\t\tWhat's this?\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tDon't drink it!\n\nHe reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a \nbrackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tI can't guarantee the vintage, my \n\t\tfriends.  I just dug it out of the hill.\n\nMadox and Alm\u00e1sy have seen many such jugs.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\tExcellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.\n\t\t\t\t(to Alm\u00e1sy, of a tool)\n\t\tToss that up, would you.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\t\t\t(mischievously)\n\t\tThere are some others.\n\n\n21\tEXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.\n\nTHE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.\n\nD'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Alm\u00e1sy.  \nThe other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German \nPHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\t\t\t(to Alm\u00e1sy, astonished)\n\t\tMy God, look at this!\n\nThey bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken, \npiled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his \ntripod.\n\n\t\t\tBERMANN\n\t\tIncredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tI've never seen anything like it.  There \n\t\twould have been enough water here to\n\t\tserve an army.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(gloomily)\n\t\tWhich means we're in the wrong place.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWould you stockpile water near to an\n\t\tOasis?  There can't be a natural spring\n\t\twithin fifty miles of here.\n\n\t\t\tFOUAD\n\t\tOr they didn't know of one.\n\n\t\t\tBERMANN\n\t\tSo, it may not be Zerzura, still\n\t\tincredible.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\t\t\t(nodding, delighted)\n\t\tA pottery hill!\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tA wild goose chase.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\t\t\t(firmly)\n\t\tNo.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\tNo.  Now we look in the other places.\n\t\tWe're eliminating.\n\nThe unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\tGood, and here comes reinforcements.\n\n\n21a*.\tEXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.\n\nLATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on \nthe flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.  \nAlm\u00e1sy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.\n\nA young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They \nare GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.\n\nAnd it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-\ncrash at the beginning of the film.\n\nMadox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round, \nas the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes \nhis helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture, \nproduces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish.\n\n\t\t\tCLIFTON\n\t\tI hereby Christen us the International\n\t\tSand Club!\n\n\n22\tEXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.\n\nThe party is in the shade of the tents.  Alm\u00e1sy joins the group.  Madox \nnods over to the Clifton plane.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\tMarvelous plane.  Did you look?\n\n\t\t\tCLIFTON\n\t\t\t\t(beaming at Alm\u00e1sy)\n\t\tIsn't it?  Wedding present from\n\t\tKatharine's parents.  I'm calling it\n\t\tRupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\tWe can finally consign my old bird\n\t\tto the scrapheap.\n\n\tAlm\u00e1sy smiles and walks on towards the others.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tMrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\t\t\t(smiling, offering her hand)\n\t\tGeoffrey gave me your monograph when\n\t\tI was reading up on the desert.\n\t\tVery impressive.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(stiff)\n\t\tThank you.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tI wanted to meet a man who could write\n\t\tsuch a long paper with so few adjectives.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tA thing is still a thing no matter what\n\t\tyou place in front of it.

The Patient lies, lost in the \ndesert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.\n\n\n24\tINT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.\n\nHana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged \nstairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy \nvolumes are perfect for treading on.\n\n\n25\tINT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.\n\nHana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out \nto continue her stair repairs.\n\n\n26*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.

I found a\n\t\tlibrary and the books were very useful.\n\nHana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping \nup the pillows.  He's short of breath.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tBefore you find too many uses for these\n\t\tbooks would you read some to me?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI think they're all in Italian, but I'll\n\t\tlook, yes.  What about your own book?\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\t\t\t(reluctant)\n\t\tMy book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we\n\t\tcan read him.\n\nHana picks up the book and hands it to him.  Then she starts rummaging \nin her pockets.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tOh - I've found plums.  We have plums\n\t\tin the orchard.  We have an orchard!\n\nShe has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tThank you.\n\nHis mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping \nfrom the mouth.  Hana mops it up.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tThe plumness of this plum.\n\nA noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\n27\tINT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.

She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in \nthe WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up \nto The Patient's open window.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWater!\n\t\t\t\t(bends to the Tortois)\n\t\tYou hear it, too, don't you!\n\n\n28\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.\n\nClose on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by \nleather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES \nare all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors \nwhich appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned \nwarriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with \nplumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like \nthose of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then \nthe Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to \nthe floor with a crack.\n\n\n29\tINT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.

He sits down to much applause from the others and \nSPINS AN EMPTY CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE on the sand.  It comes to rest pointing \nat Clifton who gets up, grinning, and plunges into Yes! We Have No \nBananas with great gusto.  His version involves CHANGING LANGUAGE \nduring each line of the chorus - prompted by Oui!  or Ja!  or Si!  from \nthe others.  Song finished, much bowing and guying, he spins the bottle \nand it arrives equidistant between Fenelon-Barnes and Katharine - until \nwith a little NUDGE from the husband it settles on his wife.  Katharine \ngets up, awkward.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tI can't sing.\n\t\t\t\t(the audience groans)\n\t\tbut I can tell a story.\n\t\t\t\t(to Alm\u00e1sy, who has arrived)\n\t\tI might need a prompt.

And indeed she was more lovely\n\t\tthan he could have imagined.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy stares at her, framed by the velvet black sky.  Katharine turns \nto looks at him.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tBut then the Queen looked up and saw\n\t\tGyges concealed in the shadows.   And\n\t\tthough she said nothing, she shuddered.\n\t\tThe next day she sent for Gyges and\n\t\tchallenged him.

For Katherine the story has \ncollapsed.  She wants it to be finished.\n\n\t\t\tKATHERINE\n\t\tSo Gyges killed the King and married\n\t\tthe Queen and became ruler of Lydia\n\t\tfor twenty eight years.

He pulls apart his luggage, quickly and methodically.  \nHe finds what he is looking for inside a trunk:  A LARGE FOSSILIZED \nBRANCH; a collection of stone leaves, wrapped in a piece of tarpaulin.  \nThen he's distracted by a noise from Fenelon-Barnes' bed.  Alm\u00e1sy \nstiffens, turns to investigate.  There's A LUMP in the cot.  A dog?  \nAlm\u00e1sy eases back the blanket to reveal a YOUNG GIRL, no more than \nfourteen, bound hand and foot.

The table seems useful more as a \nsewing area than for cooking - it's STREWN WITH ALTAR CLOTHS being sewn \ninto drapes.  On a tray on the table are TWO PHIALS OF MORPHINE from \nthe Patient's room.  As Hana turns to the stove, he's moved and covered \nthem with his bandaged hands, a second later and he's juggled them into \nhis pockets with the slightest clink.  Hana looks at him.

I was with them for some time.\n\nTHIS CONVALESCENCE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN FASHIONED FROM A LONG ROW OF \nBATHING CABINS ON THE COAST, complete with Campari Umbrellas and metal \ntables, at which are seated the bandaged and the dying and the \ncomatose, staring out to sea or in slow, muted conversation.  Hana \nwalks up to the Patient's cabin.  He is propped up with a view of the \nsea, which is interrupted by the pacing Officer.  Hana has a blanket \nand a chart for the Patient's bed.  She busies herself.\n\n\t\t\tOFFICER\n\t\tDo you remember where you were born?\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tAm I being interrogated?  You should be\n\t\ttrying to trick me.

An ITALIAN \nPARTISAN sits in the back, a SHOTGUN resting on his knees.  The truck \nstops, and Caravaggio emerges from the passenger door.  He collects \nsome packages from the PARTISAN, including a dead RABBIT, and then \nexchanges a few words with the driver.  Hana, who's watching all of \nthis from her garden, sees that the driver is a WOMAN.  The woman's \nname is GIOIA, and Caravaggio leans into the window to make his goodbye \nto her.\n\nCaravaggio approaches the Vegetable Garden as Hana comes to greet him.  \nHe throws her the rabbit, and hurries up the stairs without pausing, \nclutching the other boxes.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tSupper.\n\nHana calls after him.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWhere've you been?\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\t\t\t(not stopping)\n\t\tRabbit hunting.\n\nHana looks at the rabbit.

BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy squats with an ANCIENT ARAB outside his rudimentary house, while \nhe draws on the sand, talking in some arcane dialect, scratching out a \npossible location for the lost oasis.  The man stops speaking and \nscours the sky a beat or two before we or Almasy hear the faint noise \nof a PLANE.  It's Clifton's Steerman, Rupert Bear, coming in to land.  \nAlmasy doesn't look up.\n\nThe Arab continues to talk.  The newly-arrived Katharine has scrambled \nup the hill to speak to Alm\u00e1sy.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\t\t\t(diffident)\n\t\tHello.  Not to interrupt but\n\t\twe're celebrating.\n\nShe makes to leave but Alm\u00e1sy puts up a hand to keep Katharine there, \nbut quiet.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tThis is an incredible story - about a man\n\t\thunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me\n\t\tabout Zerzura, he thinks he's been there,\n\t\tbut his map, the route he's describing,\n\t\the couldn't survive the journey now, but\n\t\the's a poet, so his map is poetry - and\n\t\tnow we're onto an Ostrich.\n\t\t\t\t(to the Arab in ARABIC)\n\t\tI'm telling her your map is poetry.\n\nThe Arab shrugs.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWhat do you mean, poetry?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tA mountain curved like a woman's back, \n\t\ta plateau the shape of an ear.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tSounds perfectly clear.  Where does\n\t\tthe Ostrich come in?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tThe Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts\n\t\tan ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do\n\t\twith Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must\n\t\tappear not to move.  The man finds a place\n\t\twhere the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands\n\t\twhere the ostrich can see him, on the\n\t\thorizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat -\n\t\totherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall,\n\t\the moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the\n\t\tostrich comes the next day, the man is\n\t\tthere, but he's nearer.\n\t\t\t\t(to the guide)\n\t\tHaunting the ostrich.\n\nThe Guide speaks, amplifying something, picking at his robe.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tYes, the ostrich, it will feed a family,\n\t\tnot just the meat, but by selling the \n\t\tfeathers, beak, the skin, a year from\n\t\tthis one animal.  So, each day the\n\t\tman gets closer.  And the ostrich is\n\t\tnot sure - has something changed? -\n\t\tnow the standing man is only a few\n\t\tyards from where it feeds.

Entering the \ncave, Alm\u00e1sy passes with camera equipment, just as D'Ag emerges \ncarrying the corpse of a perfectly preserved DESERT FOX.

Kamal, riding shotgun, leans down and collects it, his \nhead dipping in to grin at Bermann.  Bermann looks uneasily as Alm\u00e1sy.  \nHe wants to tell him of his passion, of his absolute love for Kamal, \nbut he daren't.\n\n\t\t\tBERMANN\n\t\tI love the desert, you see.  That's my,\n\t\tthat's my - I can't think of the word.\n\t\t\t\t(Alm\u00e1sy nods)\n\t\tHow do you explain?  To someone who's\n\t\tnever been here?

I don't know.\n\nBermann holds out another segment of the orange, and watches the slim \nbrown hand collect it.  A MOMENTARY DISTRACTION IS ALL IT TAKES FOR HIM \nTO MISJUDGE THE LINE AND SUDDENLY THE DUNE COLLAPSES UNDER THE TIRE AND \nTHE CAR LURCHES SIDEWAYS AND TOPPLES OVER THE EDGE.  D'Ag - following, \nFouad beside him - brakes sharply, but can't stop his own car from \nbeing caught in the avalanche of sand, and IT PLUNGES DOWN THE DUNE AND \nINTO BERMANN'S UPTURNED CAR WITH AN OMINOUS CRUNCH, the radiator \nexploding.  Only Madox, Katharine beside him, and a little way behind, \nmanages to stay clear of the trouble.  He jumps out of the vehicle and \nslides down the dune to find pandemonium as the passengers stumble out \nof the cars, sand flying, smoke pouring from the upright vehicle, the \nwheels of the overturned car spinning wildly in the air, a puddle of \noil spreading ominously.\n\n\n77*.\tEXT.

The luggage, water and \npetrol have been stacked up and the men are loading up the remaining \ncar.  Alm\u00e1sy is working at the crumpled end of the vehicle.

Besides, if I remain\n\t\tit's the most effective method of\n\t\tpersuading my husband to abandon\n\t\twhatever he's doing and rescue us.\n\nIt's hard to argue with this logic.  Alm\u00e1sy shrugs.\n\nLATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and \nKatharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this \nfor the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged \nvehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent \nTO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to \njoin them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles \nof undulating dunes.\n\n\n79\tINT.    SHELTER.

Alm\u00e1sy pulls the door and it \ncranks open.\n\n\n90*.\tEXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.\n\nKatharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.  \nIt's full of ALM\u00c1SY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.  \nShe deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost \nexclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads, \nastonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle \nthe area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners, \nlike Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the \ncar.  He's sick.  Alm\u00e1sy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to \nshovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine \nand holds it triumphantly in the air.\n\n\n91*.\tINT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.\n\nThere's a small, weak fire.  The group crouch around it.  The boys talk \nnoisily to Alm\u00e1sy.  Kamal is wrapped in a blanket and shivering.  \nAlm\u00e1sy gives him water, speaks to Katherine.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tKamal is passing blood.  He must have\n\t\thad some internal damage in the crash.\n\t\tHe needs medicine.  I think we must risk\n\t\tthe other flare.\n\nHe gets up and loads the flare with what is clearly the last charge.  \nThis time the effect is dramatic with A RED UMBRELLA OF LIGHT.  \nKatharine comes up beside him.  They wait, hope fading with the flare.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\t\t\t(blank)\n\t\tGeoffrey's not in Cairo.\n\t\t\t\t(Alm\u00e1sy looks at her)\n\t\tHe's not actually a buffoon.  And\n\t\tthe plane wasn't a wedding\n\t\tpresent.  It belongs to the British\n\t\tGovernment.  They want aerial\n\t\tmaps of the whole North Africa.\n\t\tSo I think he's in Ethiopia.  In\n\t\tcase you were counting on his \n\t\tsudden appearance.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tAnd the marriage - is that a fiction?\n\nThere's a beat.  Katharine has a hundred answers.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tNo, the marriage isn't a fiction.\n\nThe light from the flare fades on them and they stand in the dark.  \nSuddenly on the far horizon, behind their heads, AN ANSWERING FLARE \nfireworks into the sky.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tThank God.  Oh, thank God.\n\nThere's excited shouting from the two fit boys.  They leap up and run \ntowards the couple, who meanwhile have realized that the flare has not \ncome from Madox, but from an approaching CAMEL CARAVAN.  Alm\u00e1sy shouts \nto the boys for some identification.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tDo they know them?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(squinting at the horizon)\n\t\tNo, but I think I do.\n\nThe Caravan slowly comes into focus.  IT'S FENELON-BARNES.  Katharine \ntouches Alm\u00e1sy's arm - an almost imperceptible gesture.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tAm I K. in your book?  \n\t\tI think I must be.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy turns to her.  He runs the blade of his arm across her neck - \nthe sweat leaving a clear stripe.\n\nFenelon-Barnes approaches, dismounts from his camel, and addresses \nAlm\u00e1sy.\n\n\t\t\tFENELON-BARNES\n\t\tI recollect your saying to ignore\n\t\tyour bones but I assume you have\n\t\tno objection to my rescuing your\n\t\tcompanion?\n\t\t\t\t(to Katharine)\n\t\tGood evening, Mrs. Clifton.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\t\t\t(accepting his handshake)\n\t\tHello.\n\n\t\t\tFENELON-BARNES\n\t\tI'd like to introduce you to my camel -\n\t\tthe most notable beast on earth.\n\t\t\t\t(to Alm\u00e1sy)\n\t\tI understand you found some\n\t\tremarkable caves.\n\nA goatskin bag of water is offered to Katharine.  She drinks and hands \nit to Alm\u00e1sy.\n\n\t\t\tFENELON-BARNES\n\t\tPaintings of swimmers?  Remarkable.\n\n\n92\tEXT.    CAIRO.    DAY.\n\nANOTHER WORLD as a honking TAXI containing Alm\u00e1sy and Katharine \nnegotiates the incredible bustle of Cairo.\n\n\n93\tEXT.    SHEPHEARD'S HOTEL.    DAY.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy, still in the same clothes, and evidently weary, emerges from \nthe cab, and pulls Katharine's belongings from the trunk, then holds \nopen the door for her.  As she walks towards the hotel, he hands her \nbag to a porter.  Katharine is stung.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWill you not come in?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWill you please come in?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tMrs. Clifton -\n\n\tKatharine turns, disgusted.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tDon't.  \n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tI believe you still have my book.\n\nKatharine fishes the book from her knapsack, shoves it at him, then \ndisappears.\n\n\n94\tINT.    ALM\u00c1SY'S ROOM.    DAY.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy lying on a camp bed, face down.  The walls are covered with \nmaps, enlargements of photographs.  A fan whirs over his kit which is \nspread, unraveled but ordered, on the stone floor.  An ineffably male \nroom, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing \nthe gloom.  Alm\u00e1sy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked \noff below his jutting feet.  \n\nThere's A KNOCK at the door.  Alm\u00e1sy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's \nroused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the \nknocking continues.\n\nIt's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the \nafternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into \nthe room.  He closes the door.  She turns.  He KNEELS before her, head \nat her thighs.  She's crying, her face expressionless as her hands go \nto his head.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tYou still have sand in your hair.\n\nShe starts to BEAT on his head and shoulders, violently.  He pulls \nback, to look at her, the tears streaming down her face.  She kneels \nand covers his face with kisses.  He pulls blindly at her dress and it \nRIPS across her breasts.\n\n\n95*.\tINT.    BATHROOM.    DAY.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy is in the bath.  Katharine, wearing his dressing gown, pours in \na jug of steaming water.  Alm\u00e1sy leans over the rim of the bath.  He's \nsewing, carefully repairing the torn dress.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tI'm impressed you can sew.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tGood.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tYou sew very badly.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tYou don't sew at all!\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tA woman should never learn to sew,\n\t\tand if she can she should never\n\t\tadmit to it.  Close your eyes.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tThat makes it harder still.\n\nShe pushes the sewing from his hands, then pours water over his head, \nthen begins to shampoo his hair.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy is in heaven.  The biggest smile we have seen from him.  She \ncontinues to massage his scalp.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWhen were you most happy?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tNow.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWhen were you least happy?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tNow.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tOkay.  And what do you love?\n\t\tSay everything.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWhat do I love?  I love rice pudding,\n\t\tand water, the fish in it, hedgehogs!\n\t\tThe gardens at our house in Freshwater -\n\t\tall my secret paths.\n\nShe rinses his scalp, then slips off the robe and CLIMBS IN BESIDE HIM, \ncovering his neck and shoulders in kisses.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWhat else?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tMarmite - addicted!  Baths - not\n\t\twith other people!  Islands.  Your\n\t\thandwriting.

What do you hate most?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tOwnership.  Being owned.  When\n\t\tyou leave, you should forget me.\n\nShe freezes, pulls herself away, out of the bath, looks at him, then \nSLAPS HIM VERY HARD across the face.\n\nShe picks up her dress, the thread and needle dangling from it, and \nwalks, dripping, out of the room.\n\n\n96*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.\n\nTo the Patient it's as if Katharine is walking out of his wall.  He \nsighs with pain, then looks away to where Hana has fallen asleep on the \nbed, almost on top of him.  He touches her.   He speaks as if each word \nburns him.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tCould I ask you to move?  I'm sorry -\n\t\tbut when you turn, the sheets, I can't\n\t\treally bear the sheets moving over me.  \n\t\tSorry.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\t\t\t(mortified, moving quickly)\n\t\tYes, of course, I'm so sorry.\n\t\tStupid of me.\n\n\tHana gets up, upset to have hurt him.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'm so sorry.\n\n\n97*.\tINT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.\n\nHana comes to the table, carrying a jug of water and a bowl.   She's \nstill sad.  She unbuttons her dress, pulling it off her shoulder, \nbegins to pour the water to cool herself against the night's pressing \nheat.\n\n\n98*.\tEXT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.   1944.    LATE DAY.\n\nThe EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL is a cluster of tents practically ahead of \nthe Front Line SPORADIC GUN FIRE, LIGHT AND HEAVY, SOUNDS THROUGHOUT.  \nMary walks by on her way to the Nurse's tent.  It's 1944 and the war in \nItaly is still intense.\n\n\n99\tINT.    EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL TENT.    LATE DAY.\n\nJAN is washing out of her HELMET, and stands naked in her socks.  Hana \nis using a flannel to wash Jan's back.  A couple of other girls like, \nexhausted, on their cots.  The mud is everywhere.  Another nurse is \nmaking tea out of an adapted plasma can on their tiny primus.\n\nMARY comes in and flops down.  She's GIVEN BLOOD and is pale and \nenervated.\n\n\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tOkay, Type Os, the vampires wait.\n\t\tEverybody's giving a pint.\n\n\t\t\tJAN\n\t\tUgh!

NIGHT.\n\nHana walks through the main TRIAGE TENT.  It's packed with the ruined \nbodies of the injured, swaddled in bloody bandages.  Hana stops at a \ncouple of beds, shares a word or two with the patients.  She stops at \nanother bed, leans over its occupant.  His bandaged face is bloated and \nyellow.  He's not breathing.  She bends over him, his open eyes fixed \nin a glassy stare.  No pulse.  She snaps the triangular cardboard ID \nfrom his bed to indicate HE'S DIED.  Then tenderly closes his eyes.  \nTHEY SUDDENLY SNAP OPEN.  HE REARS UP, GRABBING HER.\n\n\t\t\tWOUNDED SOLDIER\n\t\tCan't wait to have me dead?  You bitch!\n\nHe slaps her hand away.  Slaps at the tubes going into his arm.  Hana \nis absolutely shocked.  But just as suddenly he's sunk back into semi-\nconsciousness.\n\nShaken, she sits by him and takes his hand, he pulls it away, she takes \nit again.  He is in terrible pain.  His face creased with anger.  Now \nhis hand is clutching at hers.  She tries to soothe him.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tTry t be calm.  Ssssshhh.  Come on.\n\t\tBe calm now.  Ssshhhh.  Be peaceful.\n\t\tIt's okay.  It's okay.\n\nHIS FACE STILLS.  HIS HAND LOOSENS.  Now he has gone.  As Hana inspects \nhim, a shell seems to land close by.  THE LIGHTS FLICKER.  She ducks, \nalong with everyone else.\n\nBelow the bed, on slatboards, above the mud, are the now dead soldier's \npossessions.  They include A PAIR OF TENNIS SHOES.\n\n\n101\tINT.  TRIAGE TENT, EMERGENCY FIELD HOSPITAL.  EVENING.\n\nHANA, WEARING THE TENNIS SHOES, IS GIVING BLOOD.  She lies in a cot, \nnext to JAN.  The shelling sounds closer.\n\nOLIVER, the Doctor, is working on the most recent patient, a young \nCANADIAN Boy who is critically ill - the tubes hanging above him, of \nplasma and of blood.  The curtain drawn around him is pulled back, to \nreveal the two nurses in the background.  The Soldier can just see \nthem.  He's going to die any minute.  \n\n\t\t\tCANADIAN SOLDIER\n\t\t\t\t(whispering to Oliver)\n\t\tIs there anybody here from Picton?\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tPicton?  I don't know.\n\n\t\t\tCANADIAN SOLDIER\n\t\tI'd like to see somebody from home\n\t\tbefore I go.\n\nHana can only really hear Oliver's end of this conversation, but the \nmention of Canada chills her, and she knows, now, not later, that \nStuart is dead.\n\n\t\t\tHANA \n\t\t\t\t(to Oliver)\n\t\tWhy Picton?\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tHe's from there - edge of Lake\n\t\tOntario right, Soldier?\n\nThe boy nods.\n\n\t\t\tJAN \n\t\t\t\t(innocent)\n\t\tWhere's your Stuart from?\n\t\tSomewhere near there, isn't it?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\t\t\t(to Oliver)\n\t\tAs him what company he's with?\n\nOliver leans over, then turns to Hana.\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tThird Canadian Fusiliers.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tDoes he know a Captain McGann?\n\nThe boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.\n\n\t\t\tCANADIAN SOLDIER\n\t\tHe bought it.  Yesterday.  Shot to bits.\n\nThe shells are getting closer.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWhat did he say?\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\t\t\t(can't look at her)\n\t\tDoesn't know him.\n\nA SHELL SUDDENLY LANDS ON TOP OF THE SITE, PERHAPS FIFTY YARDS FROM THE \nTENT.  THE LIGHTS GO OUT.  THEN ANOTHER LANDS.\n\nEverybody is on the floor, struggling to get on a helmet.\n\nHana lies down, the blood still leaving her, her helmet on.  Oliver is \nnext to her in the mud.  Her heart is breaking.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tHe's gone, hasn't he?\n\n\t\t\tOLIVER\n\t\tNo.  He's - no.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tOh God.  Oh God.\n\nThe shells pound them, incredibly loud, drowning out her grief, but \neach explosion illuminates it for a moment.\n\n\n102\tINT.    THE MONASTERY KITCHEN.    NIGHT.\n\nCaravaggio comes into the kitchen.  Hana is slumped at the table, her \nback naked.  The jug of water in front of her.  She's sobbing, her \nshoulders heaving.  Caravaggio approaches tentatively.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tHana?\n\t\t\t\t(he touches her shoulder)\n\t\tHana?

Lots \nof Wives, including LADY HAMPTON and Katharine help serve tea and cake \nto the SOLDIERS who sit at rudimentary tables with paper plates and \npaper hats.  A man dressed as SANTA CLAUS is giving out presents - \nPENGUIN PAPERBACKS, CHOCOLATE.  Music blares out from a loudspeaker.  \nOfficers and Civilians walk the parameter.  One of these, arriving, is \nAlmasy.

OPEN-AIR CINEMA.    CAIRO.    EVENING.\n\nThe OPEN-AIR CINEMA is just beginning its evening programme.\n\nPATHE NEWS BEGINS and we date the event to April 1939.  Stories of \nimminent war jostle with images of Merrie England.  Village greens, \nsporting victories, Cruft's Dog Show.  Alone among the necking couples \n- mostly soldiers with their Egyptian girlfriends - in an otherwise \nempty block, is Katharine.  She's waiting for Alm\u00e1sy.  A SOLDIER comes \nover to Katharine's row and settles a couple of seats away from her.\n\n\t\t\tSOLDIER\n\t\tBeggin your pardon, miss, but have\n\t\tyou got a lighter?\n\nKatharine lights his cigarette and returns to the screen.  An item \nabout Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers and TOP HAT.  The stars do their \nstuff.  The soldier moves a seat nearer.\n\n\t\t\tSOLDIER\n\t\t\t\t(leering)\n\t\tI love Ginger, she's a foxy girl, ain't she?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tFuck off.\n\n\t\t\tSOLDIER\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tYou heard me.\n\nThe Soldier slinks off, muttering.  Katharine is wretched.  She sits \nhead down, not watching the screen, marooned in her despair about \nduplicity, sordid assignations.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy arrives, slides in beside Katharine, his shadow momentarily \nlarge across the screen.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tSorry.\n\nThey watch the screen.  Katharine is weeping.  Alm\u00e1sy doesn't \nunderstand.  He puts his arm around her.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tI can't do this, I can't do this any more.\n\n\n131*.\tEXT.    GROPPI PARK.    CAIRO.

He turns off the gaslights which illuminate the animal cages.  \nAlm\u00e1sy and Katharine sit stiffly on a bench.  They don't speak.  Alm\u00e1sy \nputs his hands to his head, he rubs his shoulders.  The lights are \ngradually being extinguished around them.\n\n\tFinally, Katharine gets up.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tI'd better get back.\n\t\t\t\t(she keeps him away with a hand)\n\t\tSay goodbye here.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tI'm not agreeing.

MORNING.\n\nHana sits with the English Patient - the room shuttered against the \nmorning light.  His breathing is noticeably worsening, a shudder of a \nbreath, the shallow rise and fall of his chest perceptible.  Hana \nfrets, touches his wrist, feeling for the pulse.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tI'm still here.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tYou'd better be.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tDon't depend on it.  Will you?\n\t\tThat little bit of air, each day\n\t\tthere's less of it, which is al right,\n\t\twhich is quite all right.\n\nShe squeezes his hand, suddenly overwhelmed.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\t\t\t(brightly)\n\t\tI've been talking to Caravaggio - my\n\t\tresearch assistant - there's meant to be\n\t\ta ghost in the Cloisters.  I can join him!\n\nThere's some kind of noise from the garden.  Muffled shouts.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tIt's the boy.\n\nHana goes to the window, opens the shutters.  The day pours in.\n\n\n132A*.\tEXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.\n\nHana sees Kip - barely visible - standing at the far perimeter of the \ngarden in the olive groves, HIS HANDS RAISED ABOVE HIM, HIS LEG HELD \nOUT STRANGELY.  WIRES run from his foot in all directions as if he'd \ntrodden in some elaborate steel cobweb.\n\n\n133\tEXT.    MONASTERY OLIVE GROVES.    DAY.\n\nHana appears at the edge of the Olive groves and hurries towards Kip, \nwho hasn't moved.  He shouts warning her.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tGo to the left!  Keep to the left!  There\n\t\tare mines and trip wires everywhere!\n\nHana stops, hoists up her skirt and circles left, tentative in the long \ngrass.  He shouts, doesn't want her close.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tGet Hardy.  He's on the other side of \n\t\ttown.  In the hills.  Get him to hurry.\n\nShe keeps coming, can see that he needs her.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tIt's okay - I'll help.  Please.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tThe mines, the wires, there's a trick.\n\t\tSome explode if you stretch the wires,\n\t\tsome if you cut them.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWhat do I do?\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tThere's a mine here, but the others are\n\t\tfar enough away, I think at least to\n\t\tgive me a chance.  I have to work out\n\t\twhich one to cut before I fall over.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tSo I follow the wires?\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tYou get Hardy.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI follow the wires.\n\nShe kneels at his feet and tries to trace the tangled route of the web.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tDon't touch them.\n\nShe follows one wire back to the closest mine, and traces another back \nto Kip's foot.  Then she finds another one leading off to a second mine \nsome thirty metres away.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWhy would anyone do this?\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tI've done this.  I've had to do this.\n\n\tThen Hana's suddenly tense.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tGive me a second.\n\nShe turns and tiptoes RIGHT THROUGH THE DANGER AREA, straight to what \nhad seized her attention.  Kip is appalled.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tWhat are you doing?!  Hana!\n\nHeedless, she dodges another mine and its web of wires just as THE \nTORTOISE clambers onto a clump of rock, which is, in fact, ANOTHER \nCONCRETE-COVERED MINE.\n\nHana snatches him up as he ambles towards the metal.  She turns, \nholding the protesting animal in triumph.  HER FOOT SNAGS ON A WIRE.  \nShe has to ease it off, in arabesque, still clutching the tortoise.   \nShe goes sideways to the safe zone - setting down the animal.  Then \nshe's back with Kip.  He's seething.  She is strangely elated.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tWhat is this business with you and\n\t\texplosives?  Do you think you're immune?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI promise you that was the right thing\n\t\tto do.  He's my good luck.\n\t\t\t\t(she gets the pliers from his belt,\nand hands them to him)\n\t\tNow cut.  This one.\n\t\t\t\t(she indicates the wire)\n\t\tI hope we don't die.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tOkay.  Get away from here.  Quick.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'm not scared.  So many people have\n\t\tdied around me.  But I would be a\n\t\tshame for us.\n\t\t\t\t(shrugs)\n\t\tI don't feel like being shy.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tYou must get away.  Before I cut.  I'm\n\t\tnot cutting if you're here.\n\nHe's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tActually, you can't cut, can you?\n\t\tYou'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tNo.\n\nBut he hands them over.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tKiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.\n\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tDon't talk.  Check again.  Lie flat and\n\t\tthen cut.\n\nHana checks, lies down.  He bends as close to the ground as he dares \nAND KISSES HER, THEN SHE IMMEDIATELY CUTS.\n\n\n134\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    CONTINUOUS.\n\nThe Patient lies in bed.  He's agitated by the silence.  SUDDENLY \nTHERE'S AN EXPLOSION.  He tries to shout, a croak which quickly reduces \nhim to coughing and breathlessness.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tHana!  Hana!  Kip!  Hana!\n\nHe tries to move.  He can't.  He's frantic.\n\nFOOTSTEPS, as someone hurtles up the stairs.  It's Hana.  She's ashamed \nto have forgotten him.  She rushes to him.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'm sorry.  I forgot you'd be worrying.\n\t\tWe're all safe.  It was a mine, but not\n\t\tthe mine.  Nobody's hurt.  I'm sorry.\n\nShe calms him.  He's exhausted.  His eyes shine.\n\n\n135\tEXT.    MOUNTAIN ROAD.    ITALY.    LATE DAY.\n\nHana clings onto Kip as the TRIUMPH MOTORCYCLE hares along the circling \nroad.  She has her arms around his waist.  His head turns to her for a \nsecond and she smiles.\n\n136\tEXT.    ROAD BLOCK.    TUSCANY.    DUSK.\n\nKip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being \nquestioned at a sentry post, his papers over-thoroughly inspected and \naccompanied by several meaningful glances at Hana, who waits, standing \nby the motorcycle.  One of the SOLDIERS saunters over and returns her \npapers.\n\n\t\t\tSOLDIER\n\t\tAnd you're definitely traveling with\n\t\thim of your own free will?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\tSOLDIER\n\t\t\t\t(clearly disapproving)\n\t\tJust wanting to be sure.  And he's\n\t\ttaking you to church?\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\t\t\t(deadpan)\n\t\tYes.  We're going to a funeral.  A cow has\n\t\tdied.  And in his religion they're sacred.\n\nThe Soldier isn't sure what to make of this.  He signals to his \ncompanion who returns Kip's papers.  Kip walks back to the motorcycles.  \nHe says nothing.  He kicks the starter.  Hana gets on, slides her arms \nlovingly around him.\n\n\n137\tEXT.    BRIDGE.    ITALY.    DUSK.\n\nIT'S GETTING DARK.  The bike, headlights on, crosses a bridge.  Kip has \nstrapped on his crimson emergency light as they sail along the winding \ncrest of mountain ridge that is a spine down Italy.\n\n\n138\tEXT.    AREZZO.   DUSK.\n\n\tKip steers the motorbike into the deserted PIAZZA.\n\nThey dismount and Kip starts to unbuckle his bulging satchel and unload \nthe panniers.  Hana still doesn't know what's in store and looks \nquestioningly at Kip as he walks up to the door of the CHURCH.\n\n\n139\tINT.    CHURCH.    DUSK.\n\nThey enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE \nSUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the \nflare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks \nbehind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING \nEVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE \nSTATUES.\n\nA SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the \nchurch, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are \nmomentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.\n\nNow Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and \nshoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before \ndisappearing.\n\nHana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him \nscrambling.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tKip?\n\nHe runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the \nother end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he \njust STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.\n\nSIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing \naround the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through \nspace, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted \nby Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.\n\nNow Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and \ncauses Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh, \nexhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant - \nfaces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making \nlove, which in a way they are.\n\nHana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO \nSOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of \nthe sad Queen.\n\nKip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's \nface is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.\n\n\n140\tINT.

Fiddles with \nthe bandages of his hands.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tThere was a general who wore a patch\n\t\tover a perfectly good eye.  The men \n\t\tfought harder for him.

Caravaggio walks backwards, the bandages \nunraveling and unraveling.  \n\n\n141*.\tINT.  TOBRUK.  BRITISH HEADQUARTERS.  JUNE 1942.  DAY.\n\nCaravaggio, thumbs intact and wearing a crumpled linen suit, walks \nthrough the mangled corridors of British HQ.  Smoke is rising from \nbuildings, the ominous scream of Stuka dive-bombers in the distance as \nthe harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER \nSIEGE.  BHQ is a place in the throws of dismantling itself.  \nSECRETARIES are visiting braziers manned by ARAB BOYS who stoke the \nfires as boxes of papers are fed into them.  ASHES hover in the air.\n\n\n142*.\tINT.   BHQ.    TOBRUK.    DAY.\n\nCaravaggio walks through a large room crowded with desks.  From one of \nthem, a young woman, AICHA, kisses him, frowning at the chaos and the \nshelling.\n\n\t\t\tAICHA\n\t\tHe's waiting for you.\n\nSome doors are open, revealing men and women in uniform urgently \nSHREDDING DOCUMENTS.

The building shudders and plaster dust drops \nfrom the ceiling.  Almost oblivious, the two men head out of the \noffice.  Fenelon-Barnes lugs the TRUNK last glimpsed in his tent by \nAlm\u00e1sy, until Caravaggio takes over.\n\n\n143*.\tINT. CORRIDOR OF BRITISH HEADQUARTERS. TOBRUK.

DAY.\n\nA crowd of Tobruk CIVILIANS - French and Italians among the MOSTLY ARAB \nFACES.  Their papers are being thoroughly checked by officers sitting \nat open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN \nARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her \nominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The \nOFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the \npossibility of losing her child.\n\nSuddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by \nher hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to \nrecognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in \nthe line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio \ndoesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE \nTURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH \nFOR AN INSTANT AND THE OFFICER SEES IT.\n\nCARAVAGGIO RUNS, bolts for cover, vaulting the rubble which blocks one \ncorner of the square.

AN OFFICER arrives and stops \nthe soldiers firing, and the others begin to laugh as Caravaggio hangs \nfrom the bar fifteen feet above a balcony, slowly losing his strength.  \nAnother SOLDIER waits for him in the balcony below.

There's A TELEPHONE at another table in the corner of the \nroom attended by a CLERK with A STENOGRAPHER working next to him.  The \nroom has stone walls which appear damp, and no windows.  SOLDIERS stand \nguard at the door.  It's a horrible room.  Caravaggio is trying to \nsleep, he's unshaven, and pasty-looking.  His interrogator, M\u00fcller, \nseems incredibly tired and aggravated.  He's on the phone.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\t\t\t(in German)\n\t\tYes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\nHe slams down the phone and comes back to the table.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tDavid Caravaggio.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tPetty thief, six months imprisonment\n\t\tKingston Penitentiary, 1937.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\t\t\t(barely with humor)\n\t\tI keep explaining.  You've got the wrong\n\t\tman.  My name is Bellini - Antonio\n\t\tBellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both\n\t\tpainters, I think that is confusing you.\n\nM\u00fcller doesn't even pay attention, he's going through a file.  Pulls \nout some photographs, starts spreading them out.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tIs this you?\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tI don't know.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tIt is you.  This was taken in Cairo at\n\t\tBritish Headquarters - July 41.  And so was\n\t\tthis - August 41.  And this -February 42.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tIt's impossible.  I was buying or selling\n\t\tsomething.  I've been to Cairo many times.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tYou are a Canadian spy working for\n\t\tthe Allies.  Code-name Moose.\n\nTHE PHONE rings again, is answered.  The Clerk calls to M\u00fcller who gets \nup, irritably.  Caravaggio addresses the room.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tCould I have a doctor?  I am passing\n\t\tblood.  I must be bleeding internally.\n\t\t\t\t(to the clerk)\n\t\tCan you get a doctor?  Look -\n\t\t\t\t(he spits onto the table,\nthere's blood in his mouth)\n\t\tI'm leaking blood.\n\t\t\t\t(he indicates a Guard)\n\t\tHe kicks me.  He kicks me all the time.\n\nNobody responds.  M\u00fcller is irascible on the phone, checking his watch, \nnegotiating time.  The call finishes.\n\n\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t\t\t(in German)\n\t\tHe's asking for a doctor.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\t\t\t(to Caravaggio)\n\t\tYou want a doctor?\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tYes, I've been asking for weeks, a \n\t\tmonth, I don't know, also my leg was -\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tWe don't have a doctor, but we\n\t\tdo have a nurse.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tA nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great.\n\t\tA nurse?  Great.\n\nM\u00fcller nods at the Clerk, who instantly gets up.  Just then the \ntelephone rings again.  He hesitates.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\t\t\t(in German)\n\t\tLeave it and get the nurse!\n\nThe Clerk exits.  The phone rings.  The Stenographer is plagued by \nflies.  Suddenly he slaps at one.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\t\t\t(snapping)\n\t\tWhy is there so much nose?  I can't\n\t\thear myself think!\n\t\t\t\t(turns to Caravaggio)\n\t\tLook - give me something.  So we can\n\t\tall get out of this room.  A name.  A code.\n\t\t\t\t(wiping his face)\n\t\tIt's too hot.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tI slept with the girl.  I've got a wife\n\t\tin Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points\n\t\tat you, you only see trouble.\n\nThe NURSE comes in.  She is Arab and her head is covered.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tI'll tell you what I'm going to do.  This\n\t\tis your nurse, by the way.  She's Moslem,\n\t\tso she'll understand all of this.  What's\n\t\tthe punishment for adultery?  Let's\n\t\tleave it at that.  You're married and \n\t\tyou were fucking another woman, so\n\t\tthat's - is it the hands that are cut off?\n\t\tOr is that for stealing?  Does anyone know?\n\nThere's silence.  M\u00fcller turns to Caravaggio.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tWell, you must know.  You were \n\t\tbrought up Libya, yes?\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tDon't cut me.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tOr was it Toronto?\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\t\t\t(ashen)\n\t\tDon't cut me.  Come on.\n\nNow the phone starts again.  The CLERK picks it up, there's a terse \nexchange, he puts the receiver on the desk, waits for the moment to \ninterrupt M\u00fcller.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tTen fingers.  How about this?  You\n\t\tgive me a name for every finger -\n\t\tdoesn't matter who.  I get something,\n\t\tyou keep something.  I'm trying to be\n\t\treasonable.  Fenelon-Barnes, we could \n\t\tcall that two names.\n\t\t\t\t(pauses, suddenly puzzled)\n\t\tAre thumbs fingers?\n\t\t\t\t(in GERMAN to the others)\n\t\tIs a thumb a finger?\n\nNo response.  M\u00fcller opens his palms to Caravaggio.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tI get no help from these people.\n\n\t\t\tCLERK\n\t\t\t\t(in German)\n\t\tThe telephone -\n\nM\u00fcller walks over, takes the receiver and slams it down.  an AIR RAID \nSIREN is going off somewhere, and now the faint sound of explosions is \nalso discernible, but all muffled in this room with the steady clack-\nclack of the STENOGRAPHER.  At that moment, M\u00fcller suddenly becomes \naware of what is happening.  He turns on the Stenographer.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\t\t\t(in German)\n\t\tWhat are you doing?\n\n\t\t\tSTENOGRAPHER\n\t\t\t\t(awkward, in German)\n\t\tThat Geneva Convention.  I'm -\n\n\tM\u00fcller peremptorily rips out the paper, throws it on the floor.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tYou can't do that!  Hey - come on!\n\nDURING THIS M\u00fcller's gone to the table, pulled out a drawer and \nproduced A CUT-THROAT RAZOR.  He hands it to the nurse, makes a line \nacross his own left thumb and jerks his head towards Caravaggio.  The \nnurse is extremely reluctant.  M\u00fcller claps his hands, pushes her \ntowards Caravaggio.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tGo!  Hey!  Go!\n\nCaravaggio is in terror.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tOh Jesus.  Oh Jesus Christ.\n\nThe guards come away from the door and press down on Caravaggio's \nshoulders to prevent him from moving.  The nurse, grim-faced, \napproaches, kneels at the table. \n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\t\t\t(as she prepares to cut)\n\t\tListen, I'll give you a name.  What\n\t\tname did you say?  I knew them!\n\t\tI promise.  Please - please!\n\nAnd then he SCREAMS AND SCREAMS and jerks up, carrying the guards and \nthe table with him, all heaving off the ground, the nurse thrown off \nbalance.  He falls to the floor, ROARING WITH PAIN, blood everywhere, \nthe table on top of him.  The AIR RAID is continuing outside, the PHONE \nIS RINGING, the nurse stands, pale, blood all over her uniform.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tCut the other thumb.\n\nHe stabs at his own right thumb.\n\n\t\t\tM\u00dcLLER\n\t\tThis one!  Come on!\n\nThe nurse, horrified, shakes her head.  M\u00fcller snatches the razor from \nher and heads towards the prostate Caravaggio.\n\nOne Guard has got to his feet and grips Caravaggio around the neck in \nhalf-nelson, others holding his legs, while M\u00fcller approaches.  \nCaravaggio can't move.  He's gurgling as the Guard almost strangles \nhim.  His eyes are streaming with tears.\n\nNow M\u00fcller is at his other hand, and the ROAR of pain again lifts \nCaravaggio to his feet, THE WHOLE TABLE RISING IN THE AIR, his \nmutilated hands slipping from the handcuffs lie Houdini, the drawers of \nthe table SPILLING their contents everywhere, before he sinks to his \nknees like a gored bull and BLACKS OUT.\n\n\n148\tINT.    INTERROGATION ROOM.    TOBRUK.    DAY.\n\nLATER, and Caravaggio comes round.  His eyes open and then his face \nspasms with pain.  He looks down at his ruined hands, then realizes \nhe's alone on the floor of the room, the papers still scattered, the \ntable on its side.  He gets up and staggers out of the open door and up \nthe stairs.\n\n\n149*.\tINT.  STAIRS FROM INTERROGATION ROOM.  TOBRUK.   DAY.\n \nThe corridor is deserted, but the body of a GERMAN SOLDIER sprawls on \nthe stairs leading up to daylight.  Outside Caravaggio can hear \nfighting.\n\n\n150*.\tEXT.    ROOF.    INTERROGATION BUILDING.    DAY.\n\nCaravaggio walks unsteadily along the roof of the building.  Grey and \nyellow gusts of smoke and the rat-ta-tat-tat of machine gun fire \naccompany him, and there's the sound of vehicles screeching and people \nshouting nearby, but no visual clues as to what's happening.\n\nSUDDENLY A PARACHUTE FLOATS DOWN BY HIM.  THEN ANOTHER.  THEN ANOTHER.  \nHE'S SURROUNDED BY PARACHUTES.  THE BRITISH ARE RECLAIMING TOBRUK.  A \nPARATROOPER LANDS ON THE ROOF, AND GESTURES TO CARAVAGGIO TO RAISE HIS \nHANDS.  HE SLOWLY DOES SO.\n\n\n151*.\tINT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.\n\nCaravaggio stands in front of the bed, holding up his NAKED HANDS to \nthe Patient, like a man surrendering - two flaps like gills where his \nthumbs were.  The Patient reaches out to take his hands and gently \nlowers them.  Caravaggio finds his bandages, start to wrap them back \nround his fists.\n\n\t\t\tCARAVAGGIO\n\t\tThe man who took my thumbs, I found\n\t\thim eventually - he's dead.  The man who\n\t\ttook my photograph, I found him too -\n\t\tthat took me a year.  He's dead.  Another\n\t\tman took that man across the desert to\n\t\tCairo.  Now I intend to find him.\n\nThe LIGHTS FROM THE MOTORBIKE approaching the Monastery, its growl.  \nCaravaggio goes to the window and watches as Kip and Hana arrive.\n\n\n152\tINT.   AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.   CAIRO, 1939.   NIGHT.\n\nLast seen at the Troops Christmas party, the INNER COURTYARD has been \ntransformed into an elegant outdoor banquet, with band. The \nAlm\u00e1sy/Madox team is assembled for A FAREWELL DINNER.  They are waiting \nfor Alm\u00e1sy to arrive, his seat conspicuously empty.  He is very late.  \nAnd then he's there, dangerous drunk, terribly dashing.  He practically \ndances to his chair, which he drags violently away from its position \nopposite Katharine.  He bows to Lady Hampton.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tI believe I'm rather late.\n\n\t\t\tMADOX\n\t\t\t\t(ignoring the drama of this entrance)\n\t\tGood, we're all here?  A toast,\n\t\tto the International Sand club -\n\t\tmay it soon resurface.\n\n\t\t\tTHE OTHERS\n\t\tThe International Sand Club!\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(raising his glass)\n\t\tMisfits, buggers, fascists, and\n\t\tpaedophiles.  God bless us every one.\n\nThe others drink, trying to ignore his mood.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tOops!  Mustn't say International.  \n\t\tDirty word.  Filthy word.  His Majesty!\n\t\tDie F\u00fchrer!

The Egyptians are\n\t\tdesperate to get rid of the Colonials...\n\t\t\t\t(to an embarrassed Fouad)\n\t\t- isn't that right?  Their best people\n\t\tget down on hands and knees \n\t\tbegging to be spared a knighthood.\n\t\t\t\t(to his host, Sir Hampton)\n\t\tIsn't that right?\n\nRonnie Hampton shrugs.  They're all very uncomfortable.  Alm\u00e1sy glares \nat Clifton.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWhat's my point?\n\t\t\t\t(standing up)\n\t\tOh!  I've invented a new dance - the\n\t\tBosphorus Hug.  Anybody up to it?\n\t\tMadox?  D'Ag?  Come on D'Aggers.\n\n\t\t\tD'AGOSTINO\n\t\tLet's eat first.  Sit down.\n\nThe Band is now playing Manhattan - Alm\u00e1sy, without missing a beat, \nbegins to sing, replacing the words with alternatives he knows.  He \nlurches around.  Katharine can't look at him.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t...We'll bathe at Brighton, the fish\n\t\twe'll frighten when we're in.  your\n\t\tbathing suit so thin will make the\n\t\tshellfish grin, fin to fin. --  Those\n\t\twere the words - actually - before\n\t\tthey were cleaned up.

Lashings of\n\t\tapologies all round.\n\n\n153*.\tEXT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.\n\nLater, now MOST OF THE GROUP ARE DANCING.  We see Katharine dancing \nwith Rupert Douglas, enjoying herself.  Bermann is there and even Madox \njogging and grinning foolishly.  Clifton looks at Katharine who, as the \ndance ends, excuses herself to go to the cloakroom.  Alm\u00e1sy hovers in \nthe shadows, unseen.\n\n\n154*.\tINT.    AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE.    NIGHT.\n\nKatharine comes along the familiar warren of rooms and corridors and is \nsuddenly confronted by Alm\u00e1sy, tortured and out of control.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tWhy did you hold his collar?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\t\t\t(mimicking her inflection)\n\t\tWhat?  What?  That boy, that little boy,\n\t\tyou were holding his collar, gripping\n\t\this collar, what for?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tWould you let me pass?\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tIs he next?  Do you drag him into your\n\t\tlittle room?  Where is it?  Is this it?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tDon't do this.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tI've watched you - on verandahs, at\n\t\tGarden Parties, at the Races - how\n\t\tcan you stand there?  How can you\n\t\tever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tYou know why?\n\nHe tries to hold her.  She resists\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tDance with me.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\tALM\u00c1SY\n\t\tDance with me.  I want to touch you.\n\t\tI want the things which are mine.\n\t\tWhich belong to me.\n\n\t\t\tKATHARINE\n\t\tDo you think you're the only one who\n\t\tfeels anything?  Is that what you think?\n\nSome women, flushed with dancing, turn the corner on the way to the \nLadies Room.  They collect Katharine in their train and leave Alm\u00e1sy to \nfall back into the shadows.\n\n\n155\tINT.    THE PATIENTS' ROOM.    NIGHT.\n\nHana sits with the Patient.  His eyes are full of tears.  He opens \nthem, sees her, watching over him.  He's embarrassed.\n\n\t\t\tTHE PATIENT\n\t\tWhy don't you go?\n\t\t\t\t(wiping his eyes)\n\t\tYou should sleep.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tWould you like me to?\n\nHe nods.  She gets up, touches his hand, then leaves.\n\n\n156*.\tINT.    THE MONASTERY, LANDING AND STAIRS.    NIGHT.\n\nHana leaves the room, then turns and sees A TINY LAMP on the floor, \nit's made from a SNAIL SHELL and oil.  She bends to it curiously, then \nsees a second lamp half-way down the stairs, then a third further down.  \nShe smiles in the light, then follows the trail.\n\n\n157\tEXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    NIGHT.\n\n\nIn the Cloisters THE TRAIL OF SHELL LAMPS CONTINUES, like tiny cat's \neyes.  As they reach the hopscotch chalk marks, they outline the \nsquares.  Hana HOPSCOTCHES and then follows the light, disappearing \nround a corner.\n\n\n\n158\tINT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    NIGHT.\n\nHana comes through into the stables.  The lamps lead her, then they \nstop.  She peers into the shadows.\n\n\t\t\tKIP (O/S)\n\t\tHana.\n\nShe turns to the voice.  He steps out of the darkness.\n\n\t\t\tHANA \n\t\t\t\t(happy )\n\t\tKip.\n\nAnd he goes to her.\n\n\n159\tEXT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    EARLY MORNING.\n\nHardy knocks cautiously on the door of the stables.  Eventually Hana \nopens the door.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tI was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tHe's sleeping.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tOnly we have to go to work.\n\n\t\t\tHANA\n\t\tI'll tell him.

I can love\n\t\ta coward, I can't love another dead man.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tThis is what I do.  I do this every day.\n\nAnd he's ready, Hardy having wheeled out their motorcycles.  He gets on \nhis, and they're away, Hana hardly able to look.\n\n\n160\tEXT.    A VIADUCT NORTH OF THE MONASTERY.    DAY.\n\nKIP IS LOWERED BY A PULLEY INTO THE SHAFT THE SAPPERS HAVE MADE AROUND \nTHE BOMB.  Hardy supervises.  The bombs huge - 2, 000 lbs, and \nprotrudes ostrich-like from the pit, its nose sunk into a pool of \nsludge at the base of the viaduct.\n\nKip steps off and sinks knee deep in mud, grunting in disgust.   \nWarily, he touches his huge opponent, feeling the condition of the \ncase.  He wipes the metal.  Reveals a serial number, calls it out to \nHardy, who's perched on the bank.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tSerial number - KK-1P2600.\n\nHe's hypnotized by the number: KK-1P: a bomb with his name on it.\n\n\n161\tEXT.    ROAD APPROACHING VIADUCT.   DAY.\n\nHana cycles along on Caravaggio's bicycle.  A TANK comes roaring up \nbehind her, then a second and a third, loaded up with people, citizens \nand soldiers, and children, waving flags and gesticulating.  She lets \nthe metal circus go by.\n\n\n162\tINT.    BOMB SHAFT.    DAY.\n\nBack in the shaft, Kip works away, his fingers shaking with the cold \nfrom the oxygen he's using to freeze the fuse.  Suddenly there's a \nVIOLENT TREMOR.  The ground is SHUDDERING, and the bomb slips horribly.  \nKip GRABS AT IT helplessly as if trying to stop a man from falling, \ninstead it falls on him pushing him into the sludge.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tHardy!  Hardy!  What's happening?!\n\n\n163\tEXT.    VIADUCT.    DAY.\n\nThe TANKS are rumbling towards the Viaduct.

Now SHOTS are ringing out.  In the \nshaft, oblivious, Kip slides out from under the bomb, the oxygen \nspurting everywhere, all over his clothes, hissing on the surface of \nthe water.  Hardy bends into the shaft, heedless of his own safety.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tYou've got to cut, sir, that frost\n\t\twon't last.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tGo away.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY\n\t\tYessir.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tThis is making me incredibly angry.\n\nHe rubs his hands to warm them up, locates his needle pliers and slips \nthem through the tiny gap.  His hand touches the casing and the freeze \nBURNS his hand.  He jerks back, DROPPING THE PLIERS into the sludge, \ncursing.\n\nNow he's on his hands and knees in the sludge, trying frantically to \nfind the pliers.  Hardy looks at his watch, he can't help.  The seconds \nrun out as Kip grovels in the mud.  Totally submerged, he suddenly \ncomes out with the pliers, goes straight to the fuse, no finesse, and \ncuts.  There's a snip.  Then nothing.  Then Kip laughs at Hardy.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tKiss me.\n\nHardy is already at the winch, hauling it up.  Kip can hardly clip on \nthe halter - his hands numb and burned.  As the pulley jerks he just \nclings on, rising from the grip of the mud like an ancient corpse out \nof a bog.\n\nThe other sappers have gathered around the edge of the site.  Great \nelation on their faces.\n\n\t\t\tHARDY \n\t\tGet a blanket!\n\t\t\t\t(not getting attention)\n\t\tDade!  Get the Lieutenant a blanket.\n\n\t\t\tDADE\n\t\tIt's over, Sarge.  It's over.

Kip shakes Hardy's hand.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tCongratulations.  \n\nAnd now they're all shaking hands, and slapping backs and the SOLDIERS \nFROM THE TANKS are there and the victory  celebrations begin.  Kip's \nblank, drained, not taking anything in, as Dade wraps a blanket around \nhis shoulders.\n\nHANA'S ON TOP OF THE VIADUCT, watching as Kip is wrapped in his \nblanket, the men celebrating.

There are accordions, there's dancing, \nand there's HARDY, stripped to some exotic underpants, a large tattoo: \nDORIS inside a heart, clambering up the EQUESTRIAN STATUE IN THE MIDDLE \nOF THE FOUNTAIN.  He's astride the horse and now straining to get up to \nthe tip of the outstretched sword, so that he can hang the UNION JACK \nFLAG he has in his mouth.\n\nBLACKLER, one of the Sappers, is Hardy's assistant.

The \nshattered fountain, the sluiced flagstones, shining wet and slick, give \nsome clues as to what's happened, as do the elderly standing in the \nshadows, the distressed girls, arm in arm.  ONE GIRL, young and quite \nstriking, is particularly inconsolable, her grief sobbed out at the \ndoors of the ambulance.\n\nSPALDING salutes Kip, who waves his salute away, just wanting to know \nwhat happened.\n\n\t\t\tSPALDING\n\t\tBooby trap.

Then together they start to fold the tent, Kip orchestrating, not \nwanting to talk.  Finally, Kip looks at Hana, stiff with emotion.\n\n\t\t\tKIP\n\t\tI was thinking yesterday - yesterday! -\n\t\tthe Patient, Hardy: they're\n\t\teverything that's good about England.\n\t\tI couldn't even say what that was.\n\t\tWe didn't exchange two personal words,\n\t\tand we've been together through some\n\t\tterrible things, some -\n\t\t\t\t(incredulous)\n\t\the was engaged to a girl in the village! -\n\t\tI mean -\n\t\t\t\t(looks at Hana)\n\t\tand us - he never once...

Alm\u00e1sy continues packing the equipment.\n\nAlm\u00e1sy looks up to see the plane swerve, now suddenly HEADING STRAIGHT \nTOWARDS HIM.  He's completely vulnerable, nowhere to run.  He dives at \nthe ground.  THE PLANE SMASHES AGAINST AN INVISIBLE RIDGE AND TURNS \nOVER AND OVER, the wings snapping off like twigs as it hurtles past the \nprostrate Alm\u00e1sy.  He gets to his feet and starts to run towards the \nwreckage.\n\nA blue line of smoke is uncoiling from the plane, but no fire.  Alm\u00e1sy \npulls away the debris to find  GEOFFREY - SLUMPED, NECK BROKEN, BLOODY.  \nHe tries to move him, and in the process reveals, to his ABSOLUTE \nhorror, KATHARINE, STARING GRIMLY AHEAD, UNABLE TO MOVE.
