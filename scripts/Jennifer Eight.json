COMMUNITY HALL.   DAY.\n\n     The Church of St. Peter Los Angeles. \"WHOEVER YOU SEE HERE -\n     WHATEVER YOU HEAR HERE - STAYS HERE.\" That's a notice on a\n     wall. Here's another notice \"NO SMOKING.\" Everyone is smok-\n     ing. This is an AA meeting. There's a lot of Faces to look\n     at. I don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking,\n     but when we do it's like this. Eyes like glue. 50 years old\n     with a face the color of a snuff-users hanky. He says this:\n\n                                 BENNY\n                 .. after my third recovery my wife made\n                 me swear I'd never bring another bottle\n                 into the house.  And I never did. I bur-\n                 ied it under the lawn.  Cut out a turf &\n                 stood it upright with a piece of tin-\n                 foil instead of a cork. So here we are\n                 out in the yard, and she's happy because\n                 I'm getting healthy in a pair of swim-\n                 ing shorts & no way near no booze. She\n                 decides to prune the roses. Meanwhile,\n                 I'm laying there with a straw stuck in-\n                 to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..\n\n     Curious thing about drunks. Their disease often amuses them.\n\n                 That's how crazy I was - I was sick for\n                 half a life till I finally found my san-\n                 ity again in these rooms. Don't take that\n                 drink - And for the one or two new faces\n                 I see here, I say this: just do it by the\n                 day. You gotta do it by the day - Don't\n                 take that drink. And keep coming to these\n                 meetings. Because here is where it works ..\n\n                                 CHAIR\n                 Thank you, Benny .. We have a few more\n                 minutes .. Anyone else like to share? ..\n\n     Ash into an ashtray and now a face. He's around 40 years old.\n     Intense eyes & dark hair. Probably good looking when the ang-\n     le's right. But this is a bad angle. His name is JOHN BERLIN.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                 My name's John .. and I'm an alcoholic ..\n\n                                 ALL\n                 Hi, John.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                 I didn't intend to speak today.  Matter of\n                 fact, I wasn't gonna come to the meeting ..\n                 But I wanna say a couple of things I hope\n                 may be of use, particularly as Benny says,\n                 to the new faces here. I first came into\n                 this fellowship ten months ago. I came to\n                 a meeting I was convinced was gonna be my\n                 last - how could a buncha drunks help me? -\n                 Then someone got up, I think it was Micky,\n                 and described himself as \"the shit around\n                 which the universe revolved.\" I don't know\n                 if that was original to him - it doesn't\n                 matter, it was the first time I'd heard it,\n                 and I still can't think of a better way to\n                 describe how I felt - We all have our own\n                 place in the darkness, and I was in such a\n                 mess I could hardly fucken see - I'd lost\n                 someone very dear to me - she hadn't died -\n                 I had - I don't know whether she left coza\n                 the drinking, or whether I drank coz I knew\n                 she was gonna leave - either way, the booze\n                 won - I replaced her with alcohol & anger -\n                 I was angry with her, myself, everyone and\n                 everything - Where I was I wanted to be\n                 someplace else - any place but here - any\n                 moment but now - But here I am, and it is\n                 now, and there's a big change about to hap-\n                 pen in my life - and I'm going for it coz\n                 this time I know I'm not running away - I'm\n                 actually two miles into a 600 mile journey,\n                 and I feel good about myself going there -\n                 So I stopped off to share that with you -\n                 and to thank everyone of you, and everyone\n                 in this fellowship for letting me walk out\n                 of here, free ..\n\n     2:  EXT.  OAKLAND BRIDGE.  SAN FRANCISCO BAY.  DUSK.\n\n     High above the Golden Gate. Too high for specifics. But there\n     is something down there of interest to the Camera. Descending\n     with the Music it seems to isolate a particular car. Too many\n     and too distant to know which it is. But the Camera is follow-\n     ing and already a mile up the 101 Interstate travelling north.\n\n     Maybe via a dissolve. And maybe not. But red and white either\n     way as the headlights are coming on. The Camera is closing on\n     the highway. And a car has definitely been selected. There is\n     nothing much of interest about it. It's a blue Mercedes sedan.\n\n     Mussorgsky will choreograph the pace of these cuts. The first\n     puts the frame directly in front of the car. In a few moments\n     its brights snap up. And Titles continue in a dazzle of light.\n\n     3:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  101.  DUSK.\n\n     Nobody in the car except BERLIN. And a lot of cigarette smoke.\n     Just time to wedge in a P.O.V. There's an intersection coming\n     up. He hits the indicators and crosses lanes winding his wind-\n     ow down. Takes a last hit at his cigarette and exits the butt.\n\n     4:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  DUSK.\n\n     An instant of red as the cigarette shatters up the highway. A\n     heavy sky of red and black cloud. The Mercedes turns off head-\n     ing east. This time the Camera doesn't follow. Remains static\n     over the intersection until the tail lights finally disappear.\n\n     5:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     Bare wooden boards and the sound of singing birds. This house\n     hasn't been lived in for years. No furniture other than a new\n     mattress in the middle of the floor. Still in polythene wraps.\n\n     BERLIN just about awake on top of it. Ten seconds of disorien-\n     tation while he puts this together. A stone fireplace. Stairs\n     leading to what's got to be a tiny room above. With enough ef-\n     fort this place could be charming. But right now it's a wreck.\n\n     6:  INT.  KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     This kitchen was out of date by 1963. A huge china sink and a\n     fat fridge. But the cooker works and a battered old kettle is\n     already on the gas. T-shirt and instant coffee. BERLIN checks\n     cupboards out. Crockery includes a cup and that'll do for now.\n\n     His lips articulate a silent expletive. The gas has just gone\n     out. Tries to relight it without success. On hands & knees he\n     explores a rubber supply pipe that snakes under the back door.\n\n     7:  EXT.  OPEN END GARAGE AND YARD.  HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     In the garage he finds the gas cylinder.  Empty and so is the\n     bastard with it. He drags fingers through hair in frustration.\n     Looks around at the heaps of crap that need clearing out. The\n     view beyond he hardly cares to look at.  But if he does it is\n     as follows.  Clouds massing on the horizon. Fields getting re-\n     ady for rain.  His nearest neighbor is around 200 yards away.\n     His nearest Cow about 50. This house is remote and rural look-\n     ing with a veranda out back. But BERLIN has no inclination for\n     sight-seeing. As he walks away a dreary female Voice seeps in.\n\n     8:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     The Voice comes via a police scanner. Most of this dialogue's\n     bullshit. Illegally parked autos and a few drunks still about.\n     BERLIN sits on the mattress eating a breakfast of chewing gum\n     and milk. He unwraps another Juicy Fruit and regrets it. Goes\n     round his mouth like a shoe in a washing machine. A reluctant\n     decision is taken. Spits gum at the sink as he arrives in the\n     kitchen. Starts unloading his leather bag. A flotsam of stuff\n     is excavated including a 9mm Beretta and a pack of cigarettes.\n\n     He lights up and takes a cruel hit full of nicotine and guilt.\n     Wouldn't need a clairvoyant to realize he's trying to give up.\n     Something on the scanner interests him and he wanders back to\n     the living room. There's a call going out for \"David 72 Sam 3.\"\n     David 72 acknowledges and BERLIN clearly recognizes the voice.\n\n     \"We have a 927D/ Springfield Street/ City Dump.\" But David 72\n     is already hired. \"I'm outside Emersons/ I wanna be the first\n     horrible face of her day.\" BERLIN exhales through a smile. The\n     Controller needs an E.T.A. for the 927? David 72 doesn't know.\n     Advises her to roll a couple of cars and \"Secure the location.\"\n\n     9:  EXT.  HILLSIDE.  SPRINGFIELD STREET.  EUREKA.  DAY.\n\n     A Chevrolet zig-zags up a shabby canyon. It's the road to the\n     city dump. Its final bend reveals a line of bellowing garbage\n     trucks. Everything is backed up. Nothing moves except the car.\n     The cause of the hold-up is explained at the top. A Sheriff's\n     car blocks the road. A Uniform moves to wave the Chevrolet in.\n\n     10:  EXT.  ENTRANCE/TRACK/INFILL.  CITY DUMP.  EUREKA.  DAY.\n\n     The car parks at a weigh-house and a man in his 50's gets out.\n     Looks like he hasn't slept in a while. And got the mood to go\n     with it. Sports jacket and cowboy boots. A lot of laugh lines\n     around the eyes. But you wouldn't want to get arrested by him.\n     And especially not this morning. His name is FREDERICK T ROSS.\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        You can drive down there, Sir ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I'm already walking. Where is it?\n\n     One of those walking with him is a 10-year-old Kid with a Dog.\n     TRAVIS looks almost too young to own his struggling moustache.\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        On the infill. The guy from\n                        L.A.'s just gone down there ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        He has? .. What's he doing here?\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait-\n                        ed a good while. Said he'd go down\n                        and take a look. I hope that's O.K.\n\n     The track sinks through a valley of a million discarded tires.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of\n                        luck I'm goin home. What we got?\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        A derelict.\n\n                                 TRIMBLE\n                        They cut his throat ..\n\n     The information comes from freckles and a missing front tooth.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Who are you?\n\n                                 TRIMBLE\n                        Trimble.\n\n     He wears glasses and wields a rusty .22 pump-action Remington.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Where do you fit in, Trimble?\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        His father's the manager, Sir.\n                        The kid was up there shooting\n                        vermin, and he found the body.\n\n                                 TRIMBLE\n                        Get ready for it, coz I'm tell-\n                        ing ya, you're in for a shock ..\n\n     TRIMBLE speaks with some enthusiasm. ROSS looks back with none.\n\n                        They slit him from \"ear to ear.\"\n                        Ya want me to make a statement?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Not right now. No. Thank you.\n\n     11:  EXT.  WORKING FACE.  INFILL.  GARBAGE DUMP.  DAY.\n\n     A series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up.\n     Black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind. Gulls\n     and bulldozers. Plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth.\n\n     Several cars parked here including the blue Mercedes. Several\n     On Lookers behind yellow police tape. ROSS negotiates it look-\n     ing pissed off. Looks up and somewhere in the smoke is BERLIN.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Did you bring it with you?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I hope I'm not intruding?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Be my guest. What you got?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Old guy, offed himself with a\n                        knife. I can't find the knife.\n\n     And the next thing ROSS is looking at is a death in the trash.\n     A massive dozer in the background. Everything else is garbage.\n\n                                 TRIMBLE\n                        They cut his throat.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Would you get outside the tape.\n                        And tell your dad to put that\n                        fire out ... that ain't legal ...\n\n     Another face here is so familiar ROSS hasn't bothered to ackn-\n     owledge it. BLATTIS is a 32 year old local newspaper reporter.\n     Little is visible of the body except a blood-stained raincoat.\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        I wonder what would make\n                        him do a thing like that?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Don't annoy me, Travis.\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        No, Sir.\n\n     Truck horns wail in the distance. On the horizon it's thunder.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        So where's the knife?\n\n     BERLIN wears surgical gloves. Removes film from a small camera.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I dunno .. Guess the dozer\n                        musta shifted him? You need\n                        some hands up here to look ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        You heard. Look for the knife.\n\n     Swatting smoke ROSS directs anger at a fat cop called VENABLES.\n\n                        You, too .. Move that ass ..\n\n     BERLIN hands the film to ROSS as he gets into identical gloves.\n\n                        You done the pockets?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No, Sir. I haven't started\n                        till Monday. I'm a \"tourist.\"\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        \"Welcome to Eureka.\"\n\n     By now ROSS is crouched next to the Corpse examining the wound.\n\n                        How long's he been feeling like this?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Week or two.  Musta been on the ker-\n                        osene.

A shock\n     of light. The focus adjusts and a flash bulb fires again. BER-\n     LIN moves away from the view-finder. Chewing gum stuck to the\n     side of the camera returns to his mouth. He activates an auto-\n     matic rewind. It fills the silence while he heads for a phone.\n\n     A lot of paraphernalia and technical type of shit. The bullet-\n     in board is filling up.

A couple of Coppers on their way in. One big and\n     morose looking called BISLEY. The other we've already met. Tay-\n     lor is a tall balding guy with hazy reddish hair \"How you doin?\"\n     BERLIN responds a happy \"O.K.\" with eyes returning to VENABLES.\n\n                        You know something strange about\n                        that hand?

Rubbing it\n                        with a thumb nail, or something?\n\n     But CITRINE isn't interested in finger nails. He's staring at\n     a polystyrene torso of a faceless girl.

CITRINE\n     has an eye on further photographs relevant to the Jennifer case.\n\n                        I don't know nothing about this \"Jenn-\n                        ifer\" girl, cept what some of the guys\n                        told me - but principal feature of the\n                        case was a gruesome displayal of the\n                        body. He wanted it found. So if this is\n                        the same guy, why's he hidden this one?\n\n     Another question he can't answer - and this time he doesn't get\n     a chance - BISLEY walks in with an apology for the interruption.\n     Got a face like Humphrey Bogart's mother fucked a different guy.\n\n                                 BISLEY\n                        Just wondered if you had time to\n                        get around to my pharmacy stuff?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You'll have it in the morning ..\n\n                                 BISLEY\n                        Alright, I'll try again tomorrow.\n\n     Bisley has gone but his tension stays.

It might not be ready.\n\n     He quits the car and BERLIN watches him scurry towards a service\n     shop. Rain beats on the roof and BERLIN looks stubbed out. A lot\n     of cuts coming up and here are some of them. Runs a hand through\n     his hair in unconscious frustration. A finger constantly bothers\n     the Zippo. Eyes towards ROSS who silhouettes in florescent light.\n\n     Somewhere in the background the lights change to red. Once again\n     the beeping sound of traffic-lights speaking to the blind. Maybe\n     he looks across but that doesn't matter. Something just happens\n     inside his head he isn't yet quite aware of. Everything in close\n     up. Big on the Zippo. Big on BERLIN. And he leaps out of the car.\n\n     BERLIN sprints through the weather.  A station wagon is still in\n     the air at the end of an hydraulic jack. Surprise from ROSS and a\n     MECHANIC as BERLIN arrives. Fuck the fanbelt and listen to this.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I just had this insane idea - if\n                        I'm wrong, I'll take a week off\n                        and redecorate your entire house ..\n\n     Rain beats at the roof and the jack sinks the wagon behind them.\n\n                        She's blind, Ross - that's why all\n                        the scars - hear that traffic light?\n                        That noise is to help blind people -\n                        that's why the marks on her finger-\n                        tips? - this lady reads in Braille ..\n\n     27:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN sits at a desk at the end of the room. Nothing here but\n     a legal pad and a phone. The pad is covered in names & numbers.\n     Right now he's into a call and this is sounding promising.\"How\n     old?\" And he writes 26. \"How long?\" About 6 weeks ago. Hope in\n     his eyes as he looks across to a woman called ANN. She's doing\n     what he's doing on a different line \"Wait a minute, I specific-\n     ally said I was looking for a girl?\" And all hope over because\n     Lesley is a boy.

LANDSCAPE/ROAD.  TRINITY FOREST.  DAY.\n\n     Mussorgsky is back on a shock cut. Big music and a shattering\n     landscape. Juniper woods and mountains. Sunlight on fresh fal-\n     len snow. Somewhere a long way off a car crawls up the valley.\n\n     Ross's car bursts into frame and as quickly the bend snatches\n     it away. An unexpected building in the distance. Victorian at\n     a glance but probably later. A clock tower and fifty lifeless\n     windows. The Chevy disappears towards its somber architecture.\n\n     29:  EXT.  THE SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Pine trees and slush and parked cars. The Chevrolet swings in\n     and parks in front of the mansion. Breath in the air and eyes\n     on the ugly pile as they slam doors and head for its entrance.\n\n     30:  INT.  ENTRANCE/RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN first with ROSS following. As soon as they hit the ent-\n     rance they trigger a recorded voice. \"YOU ARE NOW AT THE MAIN\n     ENTRANCE. THERE ARE SIX STEPS.\" Midway up them with ROSS look-\n     ing back. \"RECEPTION IS THROUGH SWING DOORS AND TO YOUR RIGHT.\"\n\n     31:  INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICER.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     GOODRIDGE is mid-50's with a beard like Abraham Lincoln. Sits\n     far side of his desk alternating eyes between ROSS and BERLIN.\n     The latter studies a photograph of a Girl in a file. It's pos-\n     sible they've found Jennifer Two? \"How recent is the picture?\"\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        As recent as we have ..

As I ex-\n                        plained to your secretary, we're do-\n                        ing a lotta looking, but we're not\n                        even sure it's her we're lookin for ..\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        Then what are you hoping I'm gon-\n                        na do?

What I\n                        said on the phone's the same as I'm\n                        saying now. I got no idea where Amb-\n                        er is, or who it was took her there.\n\n     He doesn't like them but not as much as ROSS doesn't like him.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        A blind girl can just walk out of\n                        here, and you don't know who with?\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        You find something curious in that?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Yeah, I guess I do.\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        Then let me put your mind at ease ..\n                        Firstly, Amber isn't \"blind\" - she\n                        has some useful vision - and second,\n                        this isn't a prison, it's a college\n                        of higher education - a severe vis-\n                        ual disability doesn't mean my stud-\n                        ents don't value their independence\n                        as much as anybody else - and Amber\n                        was a very independent young woman -\n                        She decided to leave - so she left ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        And you got no idea with who?\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        No, Sergeant, I got no idea with who.\n                        And I might add, that in another six\n                        weeks, a hundred and fifty students\n                        will be leaving here, & driving away\n                        for their Christmas holidays with pe-\n                        ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..\n\n     ROSS could sock him in the crop but the phone rings and he ex-\n     cuses himself to answer it. Whatever he hears he isn't liking.\n\n                        You have an appointment with Miss\n                        Robertson?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Yes, Sir.\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        As she's a member of my staff,\n                        may I ask what this is about?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Well, apparently, she saw Amber the\n                        weekend she left, & was briefly in\n                        the room with the guy she left with.\n\n                                 GOODRIDGE\n                        I see ..

DAY.\n\n     Looking back down a deserted corridor. Someone tried to put sun-\n     shine on the walls with yellow paint. Somewhere a long way away\n     there is a sound like children singing. ROSS loathes this joint.\n     Loathes its silence. Eyes back to BERLIN as he rings a doorbell.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Where is everyone?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I dunno .. I guess this is\n                        staff side of the building?\n\n     Here come footsteps and the door is opened by HELENA ROBERTSON.\n     Early 20's and blonde and not immediately beautiful. But delic-\n     ate features than need no make up and big dark eyes. They look\n     away for introductions as though she's shy. ROSS & BERLIN grab\n     glances as they follow in. Neither expected HELENA to be blind.\n\n     33:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Claustrophobia evaporates instantly. Great views down the val-\n     ley from every window. Plus a bizarre jumble of furniture and\n     colors. But no pictures on the walls. No friendly photographs.\n     Nor any lights. Although the afternoon is shutting down there\n     isn't a light in the room. ROSS elects to stay at the windows.\n     BERLIN takes an offered chair. HELENA sits nervously opposite.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right\n                        here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna\n                        take a few notes, if that's O.K.?\n                             (She nods)\n                        O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me\n                        in what ever way you want, what\n                        you can remember about the time\n                        you spent with Amber on the aft-\n                        ernoon she left? Take your time,\n                        and nothing's too trivial, O.K.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Well, I think I told you on the\n                        phone .. I went up to her room\n                        to say good-bye, and we just sat\n                        on the bed and chatted a while,\n                        while her friend was coming in\n                        and out collecting her things ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        What kind of friend? Was he a boy\n                        friend? An old friend? New friend?\n\n     Lots of headshake. And lots of silences. \"I really don't know.\"\n\n                        That's O.K. Can you give me any\n                        idea what this fellow was like?\n                             (Headshake)\n                        Well, d'you know how old he was?\n                             (Headshake)\n                        Alright, let me put it this way?\n                        How old d'you think I am? Twenty-\n                        six? Thirty-nine? Or fifty-three?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Fifty-three.\n\n     Possibly the only grin ROSS is going to get out of this place.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You must have some idea about him.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        When we spoke on the phone,\n                        did you know I was blonde?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Why not? You heard my voice?\n\n     A good point. And a point taken. And BERLIN might even say so.\n\n                        We don't have some kind of\n                        sixth-sense, you know. Ex-\n                        cept in ridiculous novels ..\n\n     Now another silence overtaken by a low whistle in another room.\n\n                        He used a breath freshener ...\n\n     A sardonic headshake from ROSS. Well that solves the case then!\n\n                        And I think his name was John?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        John? .. You never said that\n                        on the phone? .. What makes\n                        you think his name was John?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I don't know. I guess she must\n                        have called him John? I'm mak-\n                        ing tea. Would you like some?\n\n     BERLIN would but ROSS wouldn't. She leaves and whispers begin.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        This looks promising .. I\n                        think this one could be it?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Thank Christ we got a witness.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Let me just keep going a while.\n                        She might remember something?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        What? She's blind, Bro. You\n                        may as well ask one of these\n                        Beethoven guys on the piano?\n\n     He thumbs a cluster of cheap busts of composers on an upright.\n\n                        We're better off having another\n                        pop at old Abe Lincoln down the-\n                        re?

Sunday and no one about.\n\n                        This is fucken crazy. Two hours\n                        here, two hours back, and the\n                        only word I've written is John ..\n\n     A touch later and the sun is setting. ROSS stands at a window\n     to watch it go. Watches one or two cars driving away. Watches\n     a bird sitting outside on the fire-escape. BERLIN's voice can\n     just about be heard off screen \"You said he spoke? Can you re-\n     member what he said?\" ROSS saunters back into HELENA's answer.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Well, he just said, come on,\n                        hurry up, will you, because\n                        it's starting to snow again.\n\n     Empty teacups and empty notebook. ROSS sits opposite BERLIN.\n\n                        And I remember, he was a lit-\n                        tle breathless from carrying\n                        the cases because the elevat-\n                        or had gone out that weekend.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        The elevator wasn't working?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        No, it has a mind of its own.\n\n     A clock strikes four somewhere. And BERLIN knows he's lost it.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Can I see your hands?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        My hands?\n\n     He takes her hands and HELENA immediately looks uncomfortable.\n     He examines scars and she stares at him with her useless eyes.\n\n                        I have a class.  I have to go.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Is there anything else you can\n                        tell me? Anything about him or\n                        her? Doesn't matter how small?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        No. Except he smoked. Like you.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Me?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Yes, I could smell it on his\n                        breath, like I can on your's.\n\n     A taut instant between ROSS and BERLIN. BERLIN caught out and\n     he knows it. ROSS roars in silence \"YOU LYING PIG\" and writes\n     in his notebook. The angle switches to see \"BERLIN IS A LIAR.\"\n\n                        I'm late .. I really have to go ..\n\n     Everyone suddenly on their feet and HELENA gets into a jacket.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        D'you have a dog?

CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     ROSS baits BERLIN up the corridor. Ridicules in silence while\n     counting imaginary winnings. Watch my lips! F.I.F.T.Y. HELENA\n     walks innocent of the pantomime and BERLIN tries to ignore it.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        .. if she writes, or calls, or any-\n                        thing at all, you let me know, O.K.\n\n     He bells the elevator refusing to acknowledge ROSS's bullshit.\n\n                        I'll leave a number with the office ..\n\n     Lips drill a whisper into his ear. \"Fifty fucken dollars, O.K.\"\n\n                        What exactly do you teach, Helena?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Music composition .. and cello ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Fifty of em.

A winter mist falling down.\n     TRIMBLE and Doberman watch as BERLIN goes at it with a shovel.\n     A dozen graves already dug and he's halfway into another. Des-\n     pite the cold he sweats in shirt sleeves. Also breathless and\n     rests to catch his wind. \"Don't you have to go to bed?\" No he\n     doesn't. He wants to see the victim. Digging recommences with\n     TRIMBLE supplying the light. BERLIN suddenly stops. \"Get that\n     lamp down here.\" White lime. Black fur. They've found the Dog.\n\n     BERLIN begins an examination holding a tiny flashlight in his\n     teeth. Eyes excitedly back to TRIMBLE and gesturing towards a\n     bag. \"That bag there. You find a knife and a paira long-nosed\n     pliers.\" TRIMBLE does it relishing the snap of a switch-blade.\n\n     BERLIN still busy with the light in his mouth. TRIMBLE pissed\n     because he can't see what's happening. BERLIN removes a crump-\n     led bullet from the back of the Labrador's skull. Holds it up\n     for scrutiny. Small calibre. Badly distorted. \"Looks like a 22?\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You didn't shoot him did you?\n\n                                 TRIMBLE\n                        Me ..

But one de-\n     tail is repeated constantly and underlined. \"Identity Unknown.\"\n\n     Transmission ends and BERLIN hauls at least a yard of homicide\n     out of the machine. Can't believe what he's looking at. \"Jesus.\n     He hit six.\" Reads as he walks back into the big room and gets\n     interrupted by a call. \"Miss Robertson.

Do that, we lose both.\n                        I'm sorry, Bro, you're on your own.\n\n     41:  EXT.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.  (HELICOPTER)\n\n     The Mercedes and Music travel north. The latter made sinister\n     by this landscape. Forest plunging into dark ravines. The sun\n     colors the mountains red. But most of the valley is in shadow.\n\n     42:  EXT.  DRIVE/PARKING.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     A high wind in the chimneys. And the view is still from above.\n     Like someone's looking down from the top of the building. And\n     maybe someone is? BERLIN parks it and gets out. Stretches and\n     walks towards the institute. He looks very small from up here.\n\n     43:  INT.  GYMNASIUM.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA plays Elgar in an empty gymnasium. Sunlight streams in\n     staining the air red. As BERLIN arrives doors on the opposite\n     wall flap together like somebody just hurried out. Did he see\n     someone? Perhaps not. The trees outside move a lot of shadows.\n\n     Music stands. Vacant chairs. BERLIN takes one to watch her re-\n     hearse. Realizes just how beautiful she is. And HELENA realiz-\n     es someone is there. Before she can ask he identifies himself.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Have you been here long?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No, just a minute or two .. I\n                        knocked on your door - no one\n                        home, so I followed the music ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I'm sorry. I'll get my things.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No problem. I'm not in a hurry.\n\n     But she's already fussing about stuffing sheet music in a bag.\n\n                        Matter of fact, I saw a little\n                        restaurant place down the road.\n                        Looked kinda pretty? I thought\n                        maybe we could have some lunch?\n\n     No answer but the answer is no. BERLIN finds her book for her.\n\n                        Alright, whatever .. Was some-\n                        one in here with you? When I\n                        came in the door was flapping?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I don't think so .. No one\n                        comes here at the weekends ..\n\n     44:  INT.  STAIRCASE.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     The gale shouts its head off. The Camera looks down from above.\n     Nothing to see except the stairwell and a hand on the banister.\n\n                                 HELENA (O.S.)\n                        I suppose I'm the worst\n                        witness you've ever had?\n\n                                 BERLIN (O.S.)\n                        I gotta admit, you're one of\n                        them. Just wish I knew what\n                        you meant by a \"hollow car?\"\n\n                                 HELENA (O.S.)\n                        Well, some cars sound fat and\n                        some cars sound thin, and this\n                        kind of car sounded \"hollow\" ..\n\n     Any moment now they turn a corner of the stairs into close-up.\n\n                        Maybe it was a foreign car?\n                        Our kinda cars sound \"fat.\"\n\n     The elevator is parked on this floor with its doors half open.\n\n                        Are you sure you wanna see it?\n                        It's another three floors up?\n\n     Despite breathlessness he does. \"How often does it break down?\"\n\n                        Oh, all the time. They keep\n                        threatening to have it re-\n                        placed, but they never will.\n\n     45:  INT.  ATTIC APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Gloomy windows and a wardrobe. BERLIN walks in leaving HELENA\n     at the door. \"I sat right there, on the bed.\" The bed is gone\n     but why tell her? He checks the wardrobe. Guess what? Hangers.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        If I came to the diner with\n                        you, would you bring me back?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Of course I would ..\n\n     His smile deteriorates as he realizes she's \"staring\" at him.\n\n                        What are you staring at, Hel-\n                        ena? .. I mean .. I'm sorry ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        That's alright. You suddenly\n                        reminded me of him .. He was\n                        standing right where you are,\n                        kind of breathless, like you.\n\n     Nothing happening except the wind. Then a smile as she leaves.\n\n                        I'll get my coat, wait\n                        for you downstairs ..\n\n     And he begins an exploration. Musty bathroom with old-fashion-\n     ed fixtures. A tap leaking behind shower curtains. Nothing in\n     the cabinet. Nothing under the sink. Six steps and he is in a\n     kitchen. Finally finds something worth looking for. Tears the\n     sack out of a vacuum cleaner. Discovers a knot of hair from a\n     black dog. Simultaneously the door slams. Shock powers him in-\n     to the sitting room in time to hear a key turning in the lock.\n     Hits the door and shouts. Hears footsteps moving rapidly away.\n\n     46:  INT.  RECEPTION.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     A huge Christmas poster advertises SHASTA-TRINITY ARTS/CRAFTS.\n     HELENA sits in the deserted foyer reading Braille. The volume\n     is the size of a phone directory. BERLIN appears via the main\n     entrance. Windswept and wasted and surprised she's still here.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm sorry, someone slammed the\n                        door on me. I couldn't get out.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        It was probably the wind.\n\n     Hellava wind that turns a key! But he says nothing. Takes the\n     book while she gets into her coat. She's obviously made an ef-\n     fort. A change of clothes and her hair pinned up. But she has\n     got the sweater on inside out and the label is under her chin.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        What are you reading?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Hamlet.

It's wonderful.\n\n     By now they're at the doors with BERLIN escorting her through.\n\n     \t47:  INT.  RESTAURANT/DINER.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.\n\n     Red brick walls and help yourself to salad. All but empty and\n     their food is yet to arrive. BERLIN is clearly having a tough\n     time with the conversation. Basically because there isn't any.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        ..

You could ask one, too?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Are you wearing a uniform?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Oh.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Well, I'm glad we got the conver-\n                        sational side of lunch over with.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting\n                        in the middle of a restaurant .. I\n                        feel like everyone's looking at me ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        There's no one \"looking at you\" ..\n                        There's hardly anyone in here. The\n                        only person looking at you, is me.\n\n     And he likes what he's looking at. And maybe HELENA senses it.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Are you married?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Was.

I\n                        was in the bad lands. Really not well.\n                        It's something that happens to a lota\n                        cops. We don't wanna talk about that.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        \"Thoughts that lie too deep for tears.\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Yeah, that'll do ..

A Lunch Party just arr-\n     ived. It's clear GOODRIDGE is profoundly unhappy to see BERLIN.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I don't know, I haven't read much.

Had a dream once,\n                        about God, just around the time I was\n                        getting well .. He was a nasty lookin\n                        little guy, moved into the apartment\n                        right on topa me .. I said, don't you\n                        listen to people's prayers?  He said,\n                        prayers? Not often. They're Junk Mail.\n\n     48:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Big pines either side of the driveway. The Camera sits in the\n     back more interested in the approaching institute than BERLIN.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        .. I got really sick of the street ..\n                        so I went to school and became a\n                        Scientific Services Officer, which\n                        is basically a Scene of Crime Off-\n                        icer.

DUSK.\n\n     BERLIN looks down from the fire escape. For the first time the\n     place sounds busy. Cars arriving and doors slamming. Voices of\n     Students coming back from the weekend. \"Why were you out there?\"\n     HELENA waits inside and didn't realize he was back in the room.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Coz I wanted to feel the snow\n                        on my face .. I think that's\n                        when I heard her call him John?\n\n     Time to go and both know it. Stale shadows and growing silence.\n\n                        Is it snowing now?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No. Getting dark though.\n\n     And his eyes are searching her so hard she must be aware of it.\n\n                        You think you'd know this man? If\n                        he was in the room with you again?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        You've already asked me that ..\n\n     The silence is almost uncomfortable.

CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY.\n\n     Pretty houses in a pretty little street. Hills in the back and\n     sunshine out front. BERLIN pulls up in his Mercedes and does a\n     bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes.\n     This could only be MRS CITRINE. A budget smile and he's inside.\n\n     51:  INT.  \"STUDIO\"/CONSERVATORY.  HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Dozens of repulsive paintings.  A truly repulsive painting \"By\n     Numbers\" of the Mona Lisa in progress. The color codes are com-\n     pletely fucked up. CITRINE wears a wooly hat and hates walking\n     on crutches. BERLIN picked a bad day to come in here with this.\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        You're pushing this too hard.

I don't know\n                        what you gotten used to in Los Angeles,\n                        but I don't believe there's a Police\n                        Chief, in this country, would put a\n                        task force together for a body part ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        We have a body part in suspicious\n                        circumstances - a tailor's dummy\n                        wearing a brassiere - and a bill\n                        for seventeen dollars for its wig!\n\n     52:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN arrives at the station in the same mood he left Citrine.\n     Heads for his room and runs into ROSS's stare. Problems on his\n     plate too. He sits at his desk looking uncharacteristically an-\n     xious. What ever he's drinking isn't tea. He finds a bottle of\n     J&B in a drawer and walks toward Berlin's freshly slammed door.\n\n     52:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The lab is stuffed with junk waiting his attention. (Dozens of\n     common things made sinister by their labels and plastic sacks).\n     ROSS delivers a dose of Scotch in a plastic cup. Pours himself\n     another. Leans on a bench and gets into the pissed-off silence.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Did he shut you down?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        All but ..

By accident even? He's\n                        up here spraying the scenery all day.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        He didn't shoot it, Ross. And\n                        no way by accident. There's a\n                        flash-burn. It was point-blank.\n\n     SERATO walks in with a cigarette plugged into his ashen kisser.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        Flying colors ...\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Say you didn't say that, Angelo?\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        I said it.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Oh my God Mother's shit. Are we in it?\n\n     54:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     This room and the interrogation room are linked with a one-way\n     mirror. BERLIN looks through munching gum. EMERSON is 25 years\n     old and many pounds of vexed flesh. But something about her ex-\n     pression expects apology. SERATO paces the place chain-smoking.\n     ROSS listens devastated as the EXPERT explains his lousy chart.\n\n                                 EXPERT\n                        This is the important one. She\n                        gets a dead straight line, and\n                        that's an exceptional reading ..\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        .. this is the stupidest thing\n                        we ever done.

I just\n                        know she someway busted it.\n\n                                 EXPERT\n                        This is an honest girl. She\n                        couldn't lie if she tried ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Is she lying, Ross?\n\n     For a moment there is an intense trust between ROSS and BERLIN.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Yes.\n\n     Alright fuck it. Let's go for broke. BERLIN grabs the read out.\n     Fueled on residual anger he vanishes out the door. ROSS is fir-\n     st at the mirror to see him reappear in the interrogation room.\n\n     55:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The polygraph machine looks like state of the art. A table and\n     two chairs. BERLIN takes one and sits opposite EMERSON. She at-\n     tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        My name's Sergeant John Berlin.\n\n     And the time is his. He knows what he's doing. And she doesn't.\n\n                        I been a policeman 17 years: 16\n                        years 9 months of which with the\n                        L.A.P.D. I witnessed literally\n                        hundreds of lie-detector tests,\n                        and I never seen one like this?\n\n                                 EMERSON\n                        What d'ya mean, Sergeant?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Well, look at it. Look at this\n                        line? That's the important one.\n                        Dead straight down the page. No-\n                        body gets a dead straight down\n                        the page. Even our expert says\n                        a dead straight's \"exceptional.\"\n\n     All he's doing is telling her truth. Up to her to interpret it.\n\n                        Thought you might wanna comment?\n\n     A tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born.\n\n                                 EMERSON\n                        I wasn't actually lying, Officer.\n\n     And suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is Max Factor.\n     He's got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You busted the box, lady! You flunk-\n                        ed it .. You lied about things you\n                        didn't need to lie about .. The only\n                        truthful statement you made's your\n                        name .. Your name is Carol Emerson?\n\n     The quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible\n     sort of groan. She's bellied up and anxious to spill her beans.\n     BERLIN better get through the door fast because he might laugh.\n\n                        You tell one more lie, you're go-\n                        ing in a cell. Sergeant Ross is\n                        coming in to take your statement.\n\n     56:  EXT.  ROSS'S BOAT.  HUMBOLDT BAY.  EUREKA.  DAY.\n\n     A wave atomizes and comes down like silver champagne. HELENA &\n     BERLIN hang on the prow of the boat with the ocean rushing bel-\n     ow. Another wave and more spray for HELENA. She turns like get-\n     ting sea in your face is the best invention ever. Oilskins sat-\n     urated and her hair streaming and she knows he's loving it too.\n\n     57:  INT.  WHEELHOUSE.  BOAT.  DAY.\n\n     Sunshine & spray on the windshield. ROSS at the wheel with MAR-\n     GIE next to him. Eyes on BERLIN & HELENA playing like children.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Such a shame ..

But I wish he\n                        hadn't brought her out here.\n\n     Stairs descend to a cabin and ROSS interrupts himself to shout.\n\n                        Bobby, what happened to that\n                        beer? Rule one, is you don't\n                        diddle around with a witness.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        He's happy, darlin ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I'm sure he is. But gettin in-\n                        to the \"element\" is a bad idea.\n\n     BOBBY clatters up the stairs clutching a six pack of Budweiser.\n\n                        Tell em I'm going up the coast\n                        a way, get out of this weather.\n\n     BOBBY exits the wheelhouse and walks their eyes back to HELENA.\n\n                                 MARGIE (O.S.)\n                        Except for the hair color,\n                        she looks just like Suzanne?\n\n                                 ROSS (O.S.)\n                        Well, that's who she is.\n                        Cept she can't run away.\n\n     58:  EXT.  FISHING DECK ABOVE WHEELHOUSE.  BOAT.  DAY.\n\n     Wind over and sea content and anchored about a mile from shore.\n     Smoke from a dying barbecue and Nat King Cole croons \"Unforget-\n     able.\" ROSS sports shades and sits staring down the line. Some-\n     one plays lousy guitar and he shifts eyes into the well of the\n     boat. HELENA teaches BOBBY to play chords. Hardly worth the ef-\n     fort but they're enjoying it. BERLIN looks down from the oppos-\n     ite side of the deck. His gaze interrupted by MARGIE \"You want\n     another Coke, honey?\" Sure he does and her eyes travel to ROSS.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        You want something, darling?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I wouldn't mind another B.E.E.R.\n\n     In code so BERLIN won't understand. But he and ROSS swap grins.\n\n                        How much longer you on that diet?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm doing it by the day ...\n\n     MARGIE climbs the stairs with drinks and drinks a beer herself.\n     Popped cans change the subject. This seems like a question BER-\n     LIN doesn't really want to ask & MARGIE doesn't want to answer.\n\n                        How's your little sister?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        She's in Europe ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Working?\n\n     Clearly a sensitive subject and ROSS decides the truth is best.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        She married some English prick.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        He's not that bad of a guy ..?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Got a handshake like a\n                        partially excited penis.\n\n     The joke doesn't reach BERLIN. MARGIE's hand is on his shoulder.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Her loss, darlin ..\n\n     And she heads for the lower deck. A sweet smile as she descends.\n\n                        Anyway, you're doing O.\n                        K.

You'll\n                        bring on my \"Nervous Tick\" ...\n\n     65:  INT.  ADMINISTRATION.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.\n\n     Very late and the only light comes from coloured bulbs pulsing\n     on a Christmas tree. Apparent BERLIN has had too much to drink.\n     Makes it to his desk and shuffles at the messages. One is just\n     about important enough to get a close-up. \"TIME 18:52: SUBJECT:\n     A MAN CALLED DAN STANLEY TELEPHONED:  SAYS THERE ARE 109 JOHNS\n     WITH VOLKSWAGEN VANS IN BAY AREA: WILL TELETYPE INFO THIS P.M.\"\n\n     66:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN finishes typing something. Tears it out and seals it in\n     an envelope. Shirt sleeves and yawns. He slumps in the chair &\n     stares at \"Jennifer 8.\" Fuck this for a Friday night. He's had\n     enough of it. Grabs several envelopes and turns out the lights.\n\n     67:  INT.  ADMIN/OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN emerges from one office and heads for another. J.K. Tay-\n     lor on the door. Delivers the envelope and an his way out when \n     something detains him. Lights on the tree strobe through venit-\n     ian blinds. Illuminate bits and pieces of rattan. Plus a board\n     covered in Christmas cards and a pair of steel filing cabinets.\n\n     Maybe motivated by the booze? But a desk drawer is open almost\n     before he realizes it and he searches for a key. Nothing but a\n     bunch of business cards and family snaps. Taylor with his Moth-\n     er Taylor with his Sister (red hair like him) and Taylor with\n     his Dog. The drawer slams and one underneath opens.  Same flot-\n     sam of personal junk. Scotch Tape and paper clips and more bus-\n     iness cards. A bottle of tablets and salad of loose ammo. Fuck\n     all else and he closes the drawer. But what's this? A cane let-\n     ter rack at the rear of the desk where he finds a pair of keys.\n\n     Excitement lasts as long as it takes to try them. Don't fit ei-\n     ther lock. Now he's staring at the shadows with nothing moving\n     but thoughts. A few moments more and he's heading for the door.\n\n     68:  INT.  OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.\n\n     Massive close-up of the lock. A weird looking tool goes in and\n     another follows it. This bastard ain't easy even for an expert.\n     The frame widens to reveal BERLIN. He shuffles picks in a wall-\n     et on top of the cabinet. Was that a noise somewhere? He stops\n     to listen. wipes cold sweat away. Only thieves and foxes about.\n\n     A final twist and the lock delivers. Several dozen manilla col-\n     ored files from which to choose. A pair of folders titled Jenn-\n     ifer travel to the desk. The first is full of press-cuttings &\n     some gruesome looking snaps. Next file and this one looks more\n     interesting? A notebook full of random questions/answers/comm-\n     ents. A list of ships and sailing times. \"MUST FOLLOW THIS UP\"\n\n     Underlined twice. \"CAN'T OVER ESTIMATE IMPORTANCE.\" Also under-\n     lined. Lists of numbers. Street numbers? Vehicle numbers? What-\n     ever they might be is history because the neon just flashed on.\n     TAYLOR stands in the doorway. The surprise is mutual. The play\n     one-sided. This is already TAYLOR's game. Smokes his cigarette.\n     BERLIN is up to elbows in the jam jar and up to him to explain.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        .. feel like I'm getting close to\n                        this guy .. and all the time, feel\n                        like I'm sharpening a pencil with\n                        a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        What are you looking for?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Vehicle references.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Wrong cabinet.\n\n     He gestures to the right one. BERLIN feels about 2 inches tall.\n\n                        I'm gonna get some coffee. When you\n                        finish in here, maybe you'll let me\n                        know? .. I got a report to type up ..\n\n     As he exits he tosses a bunch of keys. They crash uselessly on-\n     to the desk. BERLIN looks like he couldn't get a fuck with mud.\n\n     69:  EXT.  ROAD.  TRINITY VALLEY.  DAY.\n\n     The mood is low as it goes. And so is the angle. Ultra low beh-\n     ind the car. Just road and a blur of tires. The frame widens &\n     the Mercedes fills it. Brake lights on as it descends the hill.\n\n     70:  INT.  TRINITY VALLEY/ROAD.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN in big close-up. His face like the Music. Here come the\n     gates of the Institute. As he turns in he stamps the brakes. A\n     van veers past him. Nothing special about it except it's a V.W.\n     He watches it vanish up the hill with other things on his mind.\n\n     71:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Christmas vacations and the building sounds deserted. BERLIN's\n     foot steps might be the only sound in the place. They stop and\n     a bell rings. Ho tries to assemble sox* kind of appropriate ex-\n     pression. But as soon as she opens the door it's obsolete. HEL-\n     ENA looks pretty as flowers & delighted he's here. She reaches\n     for his hands. And every new second makes it a tougher goodbye.\n\n     72:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DAY.\n\n     Oh Jesus look at this. She prepared him a surprise dinner. And\n     she looks so happy about it. A pathetic little table with cand-\n     les and Forget-Me-Nots and can of Diet Coke by his plate. He's\n     barely through the door and goodbye is already in deep trouble.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I wanted it to be a surprise.\n\n     BERLIN's face gets ready for something he doesn't say. Why did\n     she have to do this? And why didn't he tell her over the phone?\n\n     73:  INT.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.\n\n     A Schubert Sonata in the background. Candles low and the atmos-\n     phere junk. Evening already in the room and it feels like time\n     to go. But first he's gotta toll her something he doesn't want\n     to hear himself. \"Would you like me to make some fresh coffee?\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I have to talk to you, Helena.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I know.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You know? How do you know?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Coz you hardly said a word\n                        since you got here. But you been\n                        thinking pretty loud ..\n\n     She stands and collects the cups and gets halfway with a smile.\n\n                        I'll make some more coffee.\n\n     74:  INT. KITCHEN.  APARTMENT.  DUSK.\n\n     A hiss of running water. Close on the kettle. Close on the tap.\n     She knows what he's going to say. And now she's alone her face\n     doesn't mask her feelings. She's missing him already. But does-\n     n't know why. Simply knows she doesn't want him to say goodbye.\n\n     She reaches high into a cupboard. Her shirt stretches over her\n     breasts. Christ this girl has a great figure. Carting hair out\n     of her eyes she returns to the sink. For an instant she's star-\n     ing out of the window and right into somebody's face. Tall and\n     weird looking. But just a glimpse before he moves rapidly away.\n\n     75:  INT.  APARTMENT.  DUSK.\n\n     BERLIN has moved to the sofa. A shaft of dead sunlight crosses\n     the apartment. HELENA comes in making a brave face of it. Does-\n     n't realize he's moved. \"I'm here, Helena.\" And she smiles and\n     changes direction. Puts the coffee tray on a table in front of\n     him. No music now and all sounds in close-up. Close on the lip\n     of the coffee pot as she pours. Close on the cup she gives him. \n     Everything close in Helena's world or her world wouldn't exist.\n\n     76:  EXT.  (P.O.V. FROM FIRE ESCAPE)  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.\n\n     Not a lot to look at but the man is looking in. From his P.O.V.\n     he's fortunate. HELENA sits facing him but BERLIN has his back\n     to the window. This sort of surveillance is always ominous and\n     here is no exception. BERLIN's explanation comes with occasion-\n     al use of hands. HELENA suddenly smiles so it can't be all bad.\n\n     They stand and BERLIN reaches for his coat. HELENA crosses the\n     room. Finds her Forget-Me-Nots and now they're his at the door.\n     As he takes them he takes her hand. Kisses her finger tips and\n     can't avoid embracing her. They kiss like awkward kids bumping\n     noses. Finally part and disappear into the dark of the hallway.\n\n     77:  INT.  ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  DUSK.\n\n     BERLIN is already in the elevator. Resists doors determined to\n     separate them. They shunt in and out perpetually informing him\n     he's on the 4th floor. \"I'll call, O.K.\" She nods and releases\n     his hand. He watches her walk all the way back up the corridor.\n\n     78:  INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  TRINITY VALLEY.  NIGHT.\n\n     Headlights follow the meandering road. Another bend and lights\n     in the distance. In seconds he's passing the Diner. Still open\n     with cars out front including the white Volkswagen that nearly\n     busted his fender. He's not gonna stop. Then decides to. Makes\n     a U and pulls in. Parks a couple of vehicles away from the van.\n\n     79:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.\n\n     HELENA finishes the dishes. Stacks a last plate and closes the\n     cupboard. Heads back into the living room. Something about the\n     apartment doesn't sound right? She follows the noise through a\n     door into a bedroom. Curtains dance in the darkness and behind\n     them she finds a half open window. Curious because she doesn't\n     remember leaving it open? Secures it and silences the icy wind.\n\n     80:  EXT.  VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.  DINER.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN checks the driver's door. Locked and he explores with a\n     pencil-flashlight. Moves to a slide door at the side. Simultan-\n     eously the door to the Diner opens releasing a quartet of midd-\n     le-aged Drunks. He dissolves while they bullshit around. Laugh-\n     ter in chill air. The Comedian of the night keeps himself amus-\n     ed. Jokes about getting into the wrong car with the wrong wife.\n     BERLIN isn't laughing \"C'mon, you drunken fuck. Get outta here.\"\n\n     81:  INT/EXT.  VOLKSWAGEN VAN/CAR PARK.  DINER.  NIGHT.\n\n     A slide door rolls open and BERLIN peers in. Full of furniture\n     and cardboard crates stenciled \"TRINITY INSTITUTE - CRAFT DEPT.\"\n     Worth the try but forget it. This bastard obviously has legit-\n     imate business at the institute. Takes a last poke around with\n     the light. Spots something red. A cigarette butt caked in lip-\n     stick. But what's this white stuff? Some kind of powder spills\n     from a capsule crushed in the door rails. He picks it up for a\n     look and gets a bad one from behind! \"Whatta you doing, Mister?\"\n\n     BERLIN finds himself facing an irate looking Woman in her 20's.\n     A lot of red hair and freckles. But definitely more frightened\n     than angry. His Police Department badge is an instant sedative.\n     Gives her some crap about thefts from vehicles round here. She\n     should keep her doors locked. She smiles and thought they were.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Got your driver's license?\n\n     She hands it across and he inspects it coz that's what cops do.\n\n                        I noticed you coming outta the\n                        institute. You up there a lot?\n\n                                 WOMAN\n                        Oh, it was you that\n                        nearly ran into me?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No, it was you that nearly ran\n                        into me .. You up there a lot?\n\n                                 WOMAN\n                        I guess, more than usual this\n                        time of the year. My mother & I\n                        run an Arts & Crafts center, we\n                        buy a lot from the institutes ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Where's your store, Amanda?\n\n                                 WOMAN\n                        Oakland.\n\n     Hands the license back and is already heading for his Mercedes.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Next pit-stop, you make sure your\n                        doors are locked.  Merry Christmas.\n\n     82:  INT.  BATHROOM/LIVING ROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.\n\n     If there's moonlight that's the only light. Nothing to see but\n     a pair of large taps. Nothing to hear but a bath filling. Then\n     something starts bleeping. It's a liquid-level-indicator activ-\n     ated by rising water. A hand searches for taps. Shuts them off\n     and silences the indicator. The frame expands to reveal HELENA.\n\n     She moves to a hand basin. Finds a brush and fixes hair. Finds\n     a clip and pins it up. Close as she kicks off shoes. Pantyhose\n     descend on top of them. Walks into the living room unbuttoning\n     her shirt. Vanishes into the bedroom and the Camera waits. Ret-\n     urns with towels and the Camera follows back into the bathroom.\n\n     A creaking hinge as she closes the door. A dressing gown hangs\n     on a hook. She reaches for it and turns and virtually bumps in-\n     to the Sonovabitch. Dressed in black and stealthy as a cat. He\n     retreats a pace deeper into the darkness. Just enough light to\n     see he wears glasses. And just enough light to see her undress.\n\n     HELENA unzips her skirt. Slides it down her lags. Drapes it on\n     a chair. Removes her shirt and hangs it on the back. She wears\n     a white brassiere and panties. And no apologies for repetition.\n     This is a fantastic body. She checks water temperature. Either\n     too hot or too cold. Either way a tap goes on. Now she reaches\n     behind her back. Unclips her bra. Gets hit with dazzling light.\n\n     The Intruder is taking photographs. And if this is his turn-on\n     he's in paradise. She stands in front of him in total oblivion.\n     Her panties join clothes on the chair. Nov she's naked and now\n     another picture. Again the bathroom detonates with white light.\n\n     His face is concealed by the camera. But this bastard is about\n     to run out of luck. Moves in as she silences the tap. Suddenly\n     a lot of silence about. HELENA twists in panic. She just heard\n     something? Didn't she just hear something? Is somebody in here?\n     Fear kills her scream. She hits at the darkness. But he's gone.\n\n     83:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Big close on telephone ringing. No one home except the machine\n     and Camera. The former answers on behalf of Berlin [John, it's\n     me .. please call me .. I left two messages at the police stat-\n     ion .. they said you weren't there .. please, please, call me].\n     The camera moves on. Breakfast remains on the table. Newspaper\n     still in its wraps. Out the window a bonfire rages in the yard.\n\n     84:  EXT.  YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN clears rubbish from the garage. Grime and sweat and the\n     effort's got him breathless. Heaves another armful on the fire.\n     The phone starts ringing again. This time he decides to answer.\n\n     85:  INT.  CORRIDOR/ADMIN.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN in a hurry to get there. Footsteps tell the story. Fast\n     up a corridor and through a door. Faces look as he crosses the\n     department. SECRETARIES and BISLEY and ROSS. But only one face\n     of interest. TAYLOR turns halfway through lighting a cigarette.\n     \"Are you outta your fucken mind?\" TAYLOR says nothing. \"If any-\n     thing happens to that girl, I'm gonna break your fucking back.\"\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Just easy on the words you're\n                        putting in my face, Sergeant ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Whass going on here?\n\n     A question practically every expression in the place is asking.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        His blind friend got \"attacked.\"\n                        Angelo went up there, and some-\n                        how, it got itself in the paper.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You put it in there.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        I may have said some-\n                        thing.

You know what everyone\n                        thinks? They think you're making a\n                        case coz you found yourself a nice\n                        piece of ass.

I don't want you drunk out-\n                        ta your head searching my office ag-\n                        ain. it's pissing me, & everyone off.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You don't know what you done, Taylor.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        If, your friend from San Diego was\n                        up here, and thought for one out of\n                        two fucken seconds, she was a danger\n                        to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..\n\n     His cigarette is already stubbed and he's already walking away.\n\n                        Why don't you get yourself a dict-\n                        ionary? Look up the word \"witness?\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I know what a \"witness\" is.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Well, her, it ain't. That bitch\n                        is blind as a blonde fucken bat.\n\n     A big mistake Mister Taylor. Mister Berlin suddenly turns into\n     Harrison Ford. TAYLOR slams into filing cabinets right next to\n     the Christmas tree. Gets BERLIN's forearm under his throat and\n     fucking lucky not to get the knuckles in his gut. Both men are \n     heaving. No volume necessary in this room of paralyzed silence.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm gonna do something you never\n                        did, Taylor. I'm gonna catch this\n                        bastard. And when I do, he's gon-\n                        na find out just how good a \"wit-\n                        ness\" she is .. Meanwhile, you be\n                        aware of me - coz I wish you ill ..\n\n     BERLIN moves away and the silence is brutal. Nothing happening\n     but bad vibes. ROSS and BERLIN exchange glances, And this shit\n     is really bad. BERLIN vanishes into his lab and the door slams.\n\n     86:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN and his Dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his\n     rage are all alone. And that's how they wanna be. But the door\n     opens and here is ROSS. Have to be a friend to survive in here.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear\n                        right now.

Is that\n                        good enough for the \"committee?\"\n\n     And as long as you like evaporates before ROSS can speak again.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Well ..

Now\n     realizes whose bottle this is. Slams it somewhere on the bench.\n\n                        Here. You left your booze in here.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Who d'you think it was?\n\n     Ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldn't give an idiot.\n\n                        You think it was him?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        That's a very stupid question, Ross.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I'm asking it.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        How the hell do I know who? Some\n                        jerk-off. Some peeping-tom prick.\n\n     His hand has found the switch-blade. A nasty click as it opens.\n\n                        .. but definitely not him. This\n                        guy's in the trade.

She's dead.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Ease off, John ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm sick of this toy town shit.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Everything you say sounds reason-\n                        able.

When you had the Fat Lady\n                        in there, and I asked you if she\n                        was lying, you looked me right\n                        in the eyes and said yes.

But if he reads\n                        her name in the newspaper, I believe\n                        he'll be inclined to do something ab-\n                        out it. I've got a bad feeling.

Cows on hills and mist in the hollows. The\n     Mercedes finally arrives. Up the track and into the (refurbish-\n     ed) garage. Engine off and little but a sound of singing birds.\n\n     88:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA sits on the sofa. She's a lousy liar and having a tough\n     time with the phone \" .. my aunt called twice .. well, soon, I\n     hope so .. right now, I'm scared to be there .. who? .. just a\n     second ..

Her expression is a toss up between guilt & anxiety.\n\n                        I feel really bad about it, coz\n                        they invited me for Christmas ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Has he got your aunt's address?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I don't think so ..

O.K.?\n\n     Only thing he fails to mention is which guy he's talking about.\n     Anyway the subject is already changed. He notices tapes in her\n     bag. \"Would you like me to put your music on?\" No, she doesn't\n     want music. O.K. He's gonna light the fire and make them lunch.\n\n     99:  EXT.  WOODSHED.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     BERLIN is splitting logs and HELENA is sitting an a step \"watch-\n     ing\" him. She's looking almost happy with only worry in the way.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You're looking worried again, Helena?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        No I'm not.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You're looking more worried now than\n                        when you \"decided to stop worrying\"?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Alright, I'm worried about Christmas.\n                        I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..\n\n     A log tangents off. BERLIN retrieves it. Tosses it in a barrow.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        He'll get over it. I'll roast\n                        us a chicken, O.K.  With cand-\n                        les around it. How about that?\n\n     A distant owl hoots. She knows he's smiling. She's smiling too.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Wouldn't it be better if I cook\n                        it? You said, you can only boil?\n\n     90:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The Music is Puccini. Part one/Act two/The Humming Chorus from\n     Madam Butterfly. Giant close of the spinning cassette. The Cam-\n     era remains close as it explores the room. Candle light & fire-\n     light. Along a mantlepiece. Eleven thirty-five on a clock. Two \n     Christmas cards. Several photographs from the happy years. One\n     a picture of Ross & Berlin in uniform. Another features Berlin\n     with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair.\n     For a moment it could be Helena? But the Camera's already gone.\n\n     HELENA cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa. Looks considerab-\n     ly more relaxed. But there's a tension here and both are aware\n     of it. Stifled yawns. She stares at him and BERLIN stares back.\n     A billion people in love have been through this. It's bed-time.\n     [A suggestion of Berlin's bed to be is heaped in pillows/blank-\n     ets at the end of the couch.] \"Come on, I'll take you up there.\"\n     She finds his hand and stands. The Music follows them upstairs.\n\n     91:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Moonlight through the windows. They are silhouettes. They want\n     to embrace but in a situation like this a bedroom is the worst\n     place to be. No sound except the Music. And what's anyone supp-\n     osed to say? This atmosphere is about kissing and nothing more.\n\n     Christ hear this Music. A sweet pulse of Puccini. Big close of\n     lips meeting in moonlight. Now in each other's arms. They kiss.\n     And then they're kissing. And nothing else is happening in the\n     whole fucking universe except a telephone just started to ring.\n\n     Still ringing. Still kissing. Somebody has got to give in. The\n     phone finally gets answered. The voice at the end isn't expect-\n     ed. But BERLIN sounds pleased to hear it. It seems one problem\n     got solved. \"I gotta tell you, Margie. You are Mrs Santa Claus.\"\n\n     92:  INT/EXT.  KITCHEN/REAR ENTRANCE.  ROSS'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Is Ross throwing a party or opening a bar? Crates of booze and\n     stack upon stack of beer. A bit of \"where do you want it?\" act-\n     ing from BERLIN as he staggers in with a delivery of Bud. ROSS\n     makes room on a table. Rips a beer out the plastic and pops it.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Can't thank you enough, Ross ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Don't thank me. Thank Margie.\n\n     Swallowing beer ROSS exits the back door with BERLIN following.\n\n                        It's her invitation. And as\n                        far as Citrine in concerned,\n                        better we keep it like that.\n\n     The wagon waits outside with a few crates left to unload, BER-\n     LIN heads for his Mercedes with ROSS calling after him. \"John.\n     Here.\" Pulls a six pack from his supplies and throws it across.\n\n                        There's an old desperado in\n                        one of the cells. Why don't\n                        you give him this, and tell\n                        him happy Christmas from me?\n\n     93:  INT.  BEDROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.\n\n     The Girls prepare for festivity. They got a full length mirror.\n     A wardrobe of dresses. A menu of shoes, What they do with them\n     in this scene is their affair. Right now MARGIE's holding some\n     blue number in front of HELENA.\"It's blue silk. You like blue?\"\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Not \"you\" blue. This isn't you.\n\n     She slings the dress on the bed. It joins a pile of rehearsals.\n     Moves deeper into her dresses and HELENA appears in the mirror.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        When did John divorce?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Two or three years ago.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        What was she like?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi-\n                        professional model. But a policeman's\n                        wife she wasn't. So one day, she just\n                        packed it and left. And his whole life\n                        went straight down the nearest toilet.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        What does that mean?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        You know, he crashed. He just couldn't\n                        come to terms with it .. John hates to\n                        lose, and he hated losing her .. Every\n                        spare minute, he's driving down to San\n                        Diego, having a terrible time with her,\n                        getting drunk, and driving back .. you\n                        just don't believe the amount he drank ..\n\n     She pirouettes with black sequins. \"What do you think of black?\"\n     Evidently not much and MARGIE is getting short of alternatives.\n\n                        Wait a minute, I just had\n                        the most brilliant idea ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        You think he still loves her?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Think he still thinks about her. But\n                        not like then. Then was an obsession.\n\n     She emerges from the wardrobe with red satin high heeled shoes.\n\n                        Here .. try these .. if these\n                        fit, we got the perfect dress ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I haven't worn heels since I was 16.\n                        I don't think I could walk in these?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Sure you can. Anyway, parties\n                        are all about standing still ..\n\n     HELENA is excited to try them out. The experiment is a success.\n\n                        I'll go get the dress .. It's kinda\n                        sultry .. I only wore it once, coz\n                        in reality, I can't get away with it ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        You think John would like it?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        I think John, would love it ...\n\n     94:  EXT.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The Ross residence looks like an ad for J&B. Warm yellow light\n     from the windows. Holly wreath on the front door. The Mercedes\n     pulls up and BERLIN gets out with his bag and suit on a hanger.\n     A hard wind around the house. He walks inside without knocking.\n\n     95:  INT.  DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The den looks like a little museum. Walls decorated with Civil\n     War memorabilia. One wall occupied by a cabinet of modern guns.\n     ROSS looks like Roy Rogers trying to look like Fred Astaire. A\n     powder blue evening suit. Ho dumps ice in a barrel full of Bud-\n     wieser and BERLIN produces a couple of presents. \"This is from\n     Helena. And this is from me.\" The first obviously a music tape.\n     ROSS holds it to his ear. \"Sounds like Frank Sinatra?\" And the\n     second a bottle of (Ross tears the wrappings off) Chivas Regal!\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Let's do one of these right now,\n                        then we'll hide the sonovabitch.\n\n     But he's already lost BERLIN's attention. MARGIE walks in with\n     HELENA. Jesus what have you done to her? Bright red lipstick &\n     jet black mascara and dress made of blood red sequins. Sexy it\n     is but her it isn't. She looks like one of those big tit dopes\n     from Tennessee. She also looks like 37 million dollars. Christ\n     that smile works with paint. An appraisal comes from ROSS \"Wow.\"\n\n     96:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The whole house is going around in a haze of booze and colored\n     lights and laughter. Buddy Holly supplies the music \"True Love\n     Ways\" and ROSS is a victim of the nostalgia. Dances close with\n     MARGIE. Among the kaleidoscope of passing couples are HELENA &\n     BERLIN. Eyes closed and oblivious of everything but each other.\n\n     But someone is staring at them. About forty years old with big\n     hands. Too old for acne but the skin is bad. Got a scar on his\n     cheek like a ladder in a stocking. He continues to stare until\n     the dancers separate. Music ends and he's already in the crowd.\n\n     BERLIN arrives with a whisper for MARGIE and next thing HELENA\n     is on her arm heading for the stairs. Obviously a \"ladies room\"\n     run. Everly Brothers next record up and SERATO appears through\n     the crush. Spots ROSS who wants to know \"What happened to you?\"\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        Duty Sergeant fucked up .. can\n                        you believe it, I'm on tonight ..\n\n     \"How long have you got?\" \"One big drink.\" And they head for it.\n\n                        Did you get my message?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        I left a message on your machine.\n                        It wasn't me calling. Sam around?\n\n     This last question to ROSS who delivers a typically large shot.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Yeah .. I guess she's in the kit-\n                        chen .. We got a so-called prof-\n                        essional cook out there having a\n                        nervous breakdown over a turkey ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Are you sure you didn't call?\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        I spoke to old whass-his-name\n                        a couple of times. But not to\n                        her, and I never asked for her ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Her who?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Someone's calling the institute\n                        to talk to Helena. Says he wants\n                        to ask her some more questions ..\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        Not guilty ..\n\n     And he pushes off to see his wife. BERLIN looks around worried.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You got a quiet phone somewhere?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Hey, John, don't start getting\n                        antsy over this tonight. It may\n                        well have been the local cops?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        That's just what I wanna find out.\n\n     97:  INT.  BATHROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARGIE fixes HELENA's lips. Big on the lipstick. Another layer\n     of magenta is going on \"Are you sure I look O.K.\" Her question\n     interrupts the Revlon \"You're the prettiest girl here by about\n     two hundred per cent.\" MARGIE moves in again for the lower lip.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        How you doing on those shoes?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Don't mix very well with beer.\n\n     Perhaps she is a tiny bit tipsy? MARGIE smiles and says \"Press.\"\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Girl like you should be drinking\n                        chill white wine. Press. All done.\n\n     A knock on the door. \"Come in\" and BOBBY sticks his head inside.\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        That woman in the kitchen says\n                        if she doesn't get help within\n                        10 seconds, she's gonna resign.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        That woman is a disaster ...\n\n     She turns to the mirror in exasperation and mends her own face.\n\n                        Alright, tell her I'm coming. No,\n                        wait a minute, honey. Take Helena\n                        for me, and find John? And don't\n                        let go of her hand until you do ..\n\n     INT.  LIVING ROOM/DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A pause in the Music amplifies conversation. Bullshit and beer\n     and everyone talking about nothing. BOBBY leads HELENA through\n     the row. Can't find Berlin and now they're in the den. The ser-\n     ious Guzzlers have made it base. Everyone talking and everyone\n     lying but no Berlin and BOBBY is about to make a major mistake.\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        I'll just go see if he's in the\n                        kitchen .. you stay right here ..\n\n     Her protest is absorbed in sound. And anyway he's already gone.\n     At once she is vulnerable. Doesn't know if she's staring at the\n     back of a head or straight into someone's face. \"Didn't we meet\n     somewhere?\" The question comes from the man with the scar. He's\n     drunk as a dog and already got a tattooed hand around her waist.\n\n                                 VENABLES\n                        Hey, Popeye!\n\n                                 POPEYE\n                        Hey, Fat Guy! Gimme 2 minutes. I'm\n                        about to ask this lady for a dance?\n\n     Trash aftershave and lousy breath and clearly the answer is no.\n\n                        If I told you I'd driven all the way\n                        from Oakland would you dance with me?\n\n     Willy Nelson starts to sing. And HELENA attempts to break away.\n\n                        What's so special about the other guy?\n                        You like cops, don't you .. I'm a cop ..\n\n     HELENA finds the top of a couch. Holds it like a raft of secur-\n     ity. But where ever she goes this frightful mouth is following.\n\n                        .. let me ask you a question? How do\n                        you know the difference between one\n                        guy and another? .. Maybe you don't ..\n                        Maybe you only know the \"difference\"\n                        when you're dancing? (he laughs) If\n                        you knew what I looked like, you'd\n                        dance with me. I look like John Wayne ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I know what you look like. Excuse me.\n\n     She navigates the back of the sofa. Collides with somebody and\n     apologizes. \"I'm sorry. Is anyone sitting there?\" Enough ambiv-\n     alence in the question for the guy not to know she's blind. No.\n     No one sitting there. Simultaneously a pair of middle-age crew\n     cuts occupy the sofa. A second later HELENA sits bang into one\n     of the laps. Spilt drinks and surprise all round. Pleasant sur-\n     prise for the victim. He's a lecherous looking old bastard and\n     Helena's dress rides up for a damned good view of the lingerie.\n\n                                 FLESHY VOICE\n                        Happy Christmas, Max ...\n\n                                 MAX\n                        I normally get socks ...\n\n     Every humiliation there is. However HELENA gets out of this is\n     however she achieves it. But by the time she does she's crying.\n\n     99:  INT.  HALLWAY/STAIRS.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A calm spot between kitchen & stairs. In the background Guests\n     raid the kitchen for food. BERLIN looks like he should be smok-\n     ing a cigarette. At last MARGIE comes downstairs with the news.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        She wants to go back\n                        to the institute ..\n\n     ROSS already arrived. BERLIN looks desolate. She can't go back.\n\n                        You better go talk to her ..\n\n     ROSS watches him walk upstairs. His eyes an assessment of this\n     absurd relationship. \"All sorts of people fall in love, Darlin.\"\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I know .. ain't it a shame ..\n\n     100:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A wedge of light as BERLIN walks in. Then moonlight again. HEL-\n     ENA sits at the edge of a single bed. Hair a wreck and mascara\n     streaks down her face. He sits identifying himself with an emb-\n     race. Clears the hair from her eyes and kisses where the tears\n     were. \"It was an accident .. everyone has accidents.\" Whatever\n     he said would be the wrong thing to say. Because he doesn't un-\n     derstand. And her only explanation of this misery is new tears.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I can't walk in these shoes ..\n\n     Gently he reaches down and takes off her shoos \"You don't have\n     to dress like this for me.\" And suddenly the mood is different.\n     He is amongst her tears. Kissing her mouth. Already undressing\n     her. Her dress glides up. Silk stockings. He unclips them. She\n     feels his hands drift down her legs. Hears the zip opening her\n     dress. She returns his desire and helps him with her brassiere.\n     He kisses her breasts and by now the Camera's too close to see.\n\n     101:  INT.  BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     HELENA asleep in BERLIN's arms. Just the worry of the wind. He\n     kisses her and slips out of bed and everything slams into MASS-\n     IVE CLOSE-UP. PLUS A MASSIVE AMPLIFICATION OF SOUND. THE SLIDE\n     SNAPS BACK ON A 9 MILL BERETTA. THE MAGAZINE SHUNTS OUT. SLUGS\n     LOADED AND MAG BACK IN. THE SLIDE TRAVELS FORWARD BIG AS A CAR.\n\n     BERLIN is fully dressed. Geared up for work. Black leather glo-\n     ves and black leather jacket. Shoves the Beretta into his belt.\n     From somewhere a very soft sound of Christmas carols drifts in.\n\n     102:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM/DEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     This is deep past midnight, The house is quiet and gone to bed.\n     Fallout from the party everywhere. Still that distant sound of\n     carols. BERLIN dumps his bag and walks into the den. Just dark-\n     ness and the forgotten tape machine. Flips on a lamp and tries\n     to open the gun cabinet. Still trying when startled by a voice.\n\n                                 ROSS (O.S.)\n                        You can't get in there ..\n                        That's \"Comanche Proof.\"\n\n     BERLIN swings round in surprise. ROSS is half asleep on a sofa.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Jesus. What are you doin?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        I spose I'm drinking myself to\n                        sleep. It's Helena's Christmas\n                        songs .. they're really pretty ..\n\n     \"Silent Night. Holy Night\" and about two inches of Chivas left.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Have you got any Glasers?\n                              (Ross does)\n                        Twenty fives?\n\n     BERLIN sticks a foot on a table. Pulls a .25 Walther automatic\n     from an ankle holster. Ejects the mag and clicks out the slugs.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        What exactly you doing, John?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm going up to the institute.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Now?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        This \"cop\" that's calling, thinks\n                        she gonna be there over Christmas.\n\n     ROSS unlocks a cabinet and BERLIN is about to load the Glasers.\n\n                        I checked with the locals and our\n                        station, no one's called. Whoever\n                        it is, isn't the police.  I think\n                        this bastard's getting worried ab-\n                        out something? .. and I think the-\n                        re's just a chance he'll turn up.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Well, let's hope he does ..\n\n     ROSS selects a 12 gauge Winchester and rams the mechanism open.\n\n                        And if he does, I'm gonna\n                        drop a bomb on the fukker.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Listen, you don't havta come?\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Hey ..\n\n     ROSS is stuffing solid lead \"car killers\" into the pump action.\n\n                        Watch my lips. I'm your partner.\n\n     103:  EXT.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     This is probably a crane shot. A gale works up the valley. The\n     institute is in total darkness. Not a vehicle out front. Not a\n     sound except the marauding wind. Ross's Chevrolet is concealed\n     amongst trees. Been here long enough to allow slow flurries to\n     accumulate. It stares towards the building maybe 75 yards away.\n\n     104:  INT.  CHEVROLET SEDAN.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN wears a black wool hat. ROSS a big black overcoat. Both\n     got shit frozen out of them. A bottle available and anyone who\n     wants a slug better help himself. Plus sleet on the windshield\n     and a lot of stale time. BERLIN asks what time it is? And ROSS\n     takes a heave on the booze and waits for about a week to go by.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Where's your watch?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I guess by the bed.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        It's twenty of three.\n\n     Yawns do a circuit. ROSS flops in his seat and the angle chang-\n     es. The view from the rear covers windscreen and back of heads.\n\n                        A little young for you, Bro?\n                              (Gets his eyes)\n                        You think if she could see,\n                        she'd be hanging around with\n                        an old dog like you? You got\n                        a stomach growing around to\n                        meet itself behind your back.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Bits.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        What d'you mean, \"bits.\"\n\n     A star-light on the windshield. Distant and nobody seen it yet.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        Policemen's bodies age at diff-\n                        erent rates. Look at me. Gut in\n                        its fifties. Balls in their six-\n                        ties. And feet in their eighties ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Hit those wipers, Ross.\n\n     Urgency snaps him into close-up. Big noise as wipers clear the\n     screen. \"I thought I saw a light?\" BERLIN stares at the instit-\n     ute through small binoculars. \"There. Flashlight went right ac-\n     ross those windows!\" Instant excitement as the adrenalin pumps\n     in. \"Fourth floor. See it? He's fucken in there!\" And suddenly\n     everything including super-sinister Music is happening at once.\n\n     105:  EXT.  CHEVROLET.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Pines singing as the gale tears into them. Clutching his Winch-\n     ester ROSS opens the trunk. A dim light and a fluster of equip-\n     ment. BERLIN sorts out a pair of radios. Selects a channel and\n     ROSS whispers \"What are you on?\" (\"local Tac.\") Here come huge\n     12 cell flashlights and the intense whispers continue. \"Local?\"\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        What if we need a back up?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        We're not here. I don't\n                        want the desk to hear us ..\n\n     O.K. it's channel 4 and copy? And they're already on their way.\n\n     106:  EXT.  BACK OF BUILDING.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The storm bullies its way around the building. Lights approach\n     quickly. But one of them is already fading. It belongs to ROSS.\n     This fucker's got about 5 minutes in it. And whatever the plan\n     was it just got changed. BERLIN looks around in apprehension -\n     going in there alone ain't no joy - his flashlight ascends the\n     fire escape. And there it is 2 floors up. A half opened window.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Alright. I'll start at\n                        the top, and work down.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        You ain't going in alone?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        That's a liability, Ross. I\n                        don't want you hanging on to\n                        my shirt. Anyone but me comes\n                        down these stairs, take em out\n                        but try and keep him alive. I\n                        want this bastard living ..\n\n     Takes off up the stairs. ROSS watches him vanish. (Waiting out\n     here ain't so tasty either.) The wind rages in nearby trees. A\n     door slams repeatedly somewhere a long way away. [Ross?] \"10/2\"\n     [I'm going in.] Big on ROSS and the radio. \"You take care, Bro.\"\n\n     107:  INT.  REAR STAIRWELL.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN climbs through the window. Drops down and waits to orien-\n     tate himself. He's on a small landing midway between flights of \n     stairs. Different kinds of noises in here. One hundred per cent\n     more sinister. \"Ross. Ross? You hearing me?\" [10/2]. \"I'm going \n     upstairs.\" Snaps the safety-catch on his Beretta. And it sounds \n     ominous. Every shadow in this place is animated with foreboding.\n\n     108:  INT.  STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Looking down the stairwell. The light comes up. BERLIN arrives\n     on another floor. Hard to sweat in here but he's doing it. His\n     progress is distinctly cautious. A harsh wind rockets down the\n     stairs flapping a pair of owing doors. BERLIN eases through in-\n     to the corridor. At its far end is the elevator. He travels to-\n     wards it in an eerie piston of light. [John? What's happening?]\n\n     109:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     ROSS has moved into the shelter of a wall. Sleet passes almost\n     horizontally. His flashlight is over. The color of a tangerine.\n\n                                 ROSS [BERLIN]\n                        [I'm on Helena's floor .. I'm\n                        just gonna take a look at her\n                        apartment .. You O.K.] Fucken\n                        flashlight's kaput ..

CORRIDOR.  INSTITUTE.  NlGHT.\n\n     BERLIN stares up at the coiling \"I can hear footsteps .. right\n     up above?\" They disappear into the gale. Doors beat at the end\n     of the corridor. He moves towards them and pushes out onto the\n     stairway. Nothing but the wind. He's about to climb when an al-\n     arming voice shocks him rigid. \"YOU ARE NOW ON THE THIRD FLOOR.\"\n\n     BERLIN is already running. Light swinging wildly as he sprints\n     back up the corridor. Fifteen yards to elevator/stairs. Breath-\n     less as hell he hits the radio. \"Fucker's in the elevator.\" Al-\n     most jumps stairs in haste. Bursts out onto the 3rd floor. Ham-\n     mer back on the Beretta. Just in time to see the doors closing.\n\n     \"Get ready, Ross. He maybe coming down.\" But he isn't. He's go-\n     ing up. By the time he's recovered breath the Voice is back in\n     business. Whoever rides the elevator is now on the fifth floor.\n\n     111:  INT.  STAIRWELL.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Totally breathless now. Eyes ascend faster than feet. Whine of\n     a swinging door. BERLIN rounds the stairwell. The door's still\n     busy. Top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in.\n\n     BERLIN'S P.O.V. as he heads for that door. Closer. Three steps\n     to go. Closer. Two steps more. One step. Reaches for it. Whamm! \n     The door smashes into him like it hates him. So fast it hardly\n     happened. He staggers back. His flashlight clatters downstairs.\n\n     Banisters capsize as the light passes. Every shadow goes crazy.\n     The flashlight arrives at a lower level. Rolls away and stops.\n     Wastes power into a corner. Can't see Berlin and can't see his\n     radio. But Ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet.\n\n                        [John? John? Are you al-\n                        right? .. Come in, John?]\n\n     112:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE/FIRE ESCAPE.  NIGHT.\n\n     ROSS savaged by the gale. In considerable anxiety. Less than a\n     volt in his batteries. His failure to contact Berlin accelerat-\n     es his concern by the moment. Calls repeatedly \"You hearing me?\"\n\n     Big close on the radio. Fingers switch channels. Tries calling\n     on five/six. Still nothing and goes to channel eight. \"Come in,\n     John?\" Alright fuck it. Light or no light. He's going up there. \n     Still calling he barges at the wind making for the fire escape.\n\n                        [You hear me? Just be care-\n                        ful now, coz I'm coming up]\n\n     Stares up into the gloom of the iron stairs. Hardly got a foot\n     on the first before a Figure rushes down. Dressed in black and\n     very breathless. A powerful flashlight floods on dazzling ROSS.\n\n                        Is that you, John? .. Ans-\n                        wer. NOW .. Or I blow this\n                        fucken staircase to pieces.\n\n                                 BERLIN [?]\n                        Me, Freddy.\n\n     Thank Jesus the anxiety's over. The 12 gauge drops to his side.\n\n                                 ROSS\n                        What the hell's going on up there,\n                        Brother? I been calling 10 minutes.\n\n     The light remains steady and blinding and straight in his face.\n\n                        Hey, c'mon, John .. Talk to me ...\n\n     Just the sound of breathlessness. Plus a .25 Walther automatic.\n\n                        Jesus Christ .. What are you doing?\n\n     It glints at the peripheries of his vision and ROSS is alarmed.\n\n                        What the fuck are you doing? - It's\n                        me - Holy shit! - John - John - Not\n                        you - Don't shoot you crazy bastard!\n\n     Two deathly flashes in quick succession. The first practically\n     taken Ross's hand off. The second slams into his guts and he's\n     down. The Glaser is unequalled in ferocity by any other bullet.\n\n     113:  EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE (ATTIC LEVEL).  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The MYOPIC JANITOR looks down. Five floors below a man lays on\n     his back. His shotgun discharges uselessly into trees. Another\n     man leans over him. Illuminates his agonized face with a flash-\n     light. Shoots him again point-blank in the upper body. The MYO-\n     PIC isn't staying for more. Hurries back along the fire escape.\n\n     114:  INT.  ATTIC APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Wind breaks on the roof like waves. An utterly dismal room lit\n     by a starving light bulb. The MYOPIC arrives from the fire esc-\n     ape. Huge eyes behind those orb-like glasses. Picks up a phone\n     and dials. Piles and piles of old newspapers. Hundreds of fuck \n     magazines. In the kitchen section a mass of photographic equip-\n     ment includes an enlarger on the table a flash camera.  On the\n     wall behind him a collage of snaps of half dressed girls. Plus\n     a special enlargement of Helena standing naked in her bathroom.\n\n                                 MYOPIC\n                        Gimme the police. Quickly.\n\n     115:  EXT.  REAR OF INSTITUTE.  FIRE ESCAPE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Close on a bulb in a flashlight. The merest glimmer of energy.\n     Barely the light to see the blood. It seeps into a long-frozen\n     footprint in the ice. Fills it fast and expands over the sides.\n\n     Somebody say this can't be happening? BERLIN crumples to knees\n     in the snow. Dumps his light gasping for breath. Oblique light\n     creating desperate silhouettes. BERLIN howls like a dog. Howls\n     into his radio. \"Nine - Nine - Nine.\" Blood all over his hands.\n\n     \"This is a Nine - Nine - Nine - officer down.\" ROSS is heaving \n     like an old bull elephant. On the verge of unconsciousness. He\n     tries to speak. Got hit in the throat. BERLIN fights off tears.\n\n     \"Don't talk old man.\" Repeats the emergency code but this time\n     he can't be heard. Almost imperceptibly a Carol filters in (In\n     The Bleak Mid Winter) and the Camera moves slowly away. BERLIN\n     cradles ROSS's tragic head and the song drowns the raging wind.\n\n     This beautiful Christmas carol will articulate rhythm of these\n     cuts. And there will be no other sound until the sequence ends.\n\n     116:  EXT.  CITY STREET.  CITY HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.\n\n     A blue emergency light. Revolving in slow motion. Like a dream.\n     The city streets are a blur. The light accelerates into sudden\n     reality. Ambulance plus police convoy speed to a city hospital.\n\n     117:  INT.  EMERGENCY ROOM.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.\n\n     Close-up of MARGIE kissing her husband's lips for the last time.\n     Tears spill down his cheeks from her eyes. FREDDY ROSS is dead.\n\n     118:  INT.  WAITING AREA.  HOSPITAL.  NIGHT.\n\n     Outside in the corridor. Looking in at BERLIN. He sits head in\n     hands on a bench. This is somebody's point of view. The camera\n     travels up the windows. Waits at a distance as CITRINE arrives.\n     Pajamas under his clothes. He walks with assistance of a stick.\n\n     Neither say anything because both know what this is about. BER-\n     LIN stands and hands over his badge. Exits the mag and now his\n     Beretta. A brief word from CITRINE and he turns and walks away.\n\n     119:  EXT.  LANDSCAPE.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     A little house in winter meadows. Kind of pretty now it's pain-\n     ted. Just the first tint of pink on its roof. The Carol dissol-\n     ves into birdsong. Here comes the sun for a fine Christmas day.\n\n     120:  EXT.  VERANDA.  HOUSE.  DAWN.\n\n     All new paint and all new things in expectation of happy times.\n     A barbecue still in polythene wraps. Price tag and unconnected\n     gas pipe shift gently in the breeze. A brand now swinging seat.\n\n     BERLIN sits in it with shock wearing on. Expressionless of sor-\n     row. Though he suffers every sorrow and guilt and regret there\n     is. Sunlight reaches the veranda and colors the end of it red.\n     silent and motionless he watches the lousiest dawn of his life.\n\n     121:  EXT/INT.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  LIVING ROOM.  DAY.\n\n     Lights glow on the Christmas tree. Unopened presents still und-\n     erneath. SERATO sits smoking in silence. Listens to a sound of\n     plates getting stacked in another room. He looks up but not in\n     surprise. He just wasn't aware BERLIN had arrived in the house.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Where's Margie?\n\n     Stunned and stubbled and full of grief. And that's just SERATO.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        Taken Bobby to her sister's ..\n\n     This atmosphere is unbearable and even these whispers seem laud.\n\n                        They were going there anyway.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Does he know?\n\n     SERATO shakes his head. Loses his cigarette. And SAMMY appears.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        Thinks his dad's in hospital.\n\n     SAMMY SERATO is 30 and pretty. She continues collecting plates.\n\n                        Why'd you go up there, John?\n\n     Knows he's not going to get a reply and doesn't bother to wait\n     for it. HELENA materializes from the den like a shadow. Sallow\n     for want of sleep and glad to have BERLIN's hand to hang on to.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I want you to go to your Aunt's.\n\n     A suggestion that surprises HELENA. And clearly doesn't appeal.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Why can't I stay with you?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        It's not possible right now.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Why?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Please don't ask no quest-\n                        ions now .. Not right now ..\n\n     If silence can intensify it's now. Sound of the front door and\n     then footsteps. BERLIN freezes as MARGIE appears. Wracked with\n     grief. Dead sickness of tears. Like she cried bones out of her\n     face. But no weeping now. Maybe shock. Maybe brave. Maybe both.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Is that Margie?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        I'm here, honey. I'm right here.\n\n     The strongest face in the house. And now HELENA is in her arms.\n\n                        Don't cry darlin .. he was a big\n                        old cop and he didn't like tears ..\n\n     Dead echos of plates in the kitchen. And song of birds outside.\n\n                        Feels like every second in my life,\n                        was just the moment leading to this.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Margie ..\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Don't.\n\n     Raises her hand to silence him and this is silence Margie owns.\n\n                        Don't.\n\n     Christ this is just awful. HELENA crying and BERLIN on the way.\n\n                        What's gonna happen now, John?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        She has an aunt, in Vermont.\n                        I'll take her there tonight.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I'm going back to the institute.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No .. not now ..\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Helena can stay here if she'd like\n                        to .. I'd like her to .. I'll look\n                        after her .. and she can look after\n                        me .. I'm tired now .. I must sleep ..\n\n     Footsteps again as she walks out and silence again like before.\n\n     122:  INT.  BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The Camera will slowly crane down on BERLIN. Fully dressed but\n     wiped out he lays an the bad. Last thing he needs is booze. He\n     is clearly full of it. Drifting in and out of consciousness. A\n     nightmare either side of the line. He relives that night again.\n     And Ross is alive again as guilt and regret demand to be heard.\n\n                                 (ROSS)\n                        You want me to make a predict-\n                        ion?

What time is it?\n\n                                 (ROSS)\n                        Twenty-six minutes past two ..\n\n                                 (BERLIN)\n                        You shouldn't have come, Ross.\n\n                                 (ROSS)\n                        Don't worry .. You take your\n                        time .. I just wanna be back\n                        in time for Bobby's presents ..\n\n     A memory that is too terrible to bear. BERLIN gets up and sits\n     at the edge of the bad. Head in hands. Wants the pain to go aw-\n     ay. But anguish is stronger than alcohol. Hears noises outside\n     and makes it to a window. Tears curtains back revealing lights.\n     His Mercedes hangs in space as though staring into the bedroom.\n\n     123:  EXT.  FRONT YARD.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The Mercedes descends onto a low-loader courtesy of a car lift-\n     ing truck. BERLIN out of his door. Almost too ruined to apprec-\n     iate what's happening. Crane lights and flashlights and chains\n     getting tightened. Couple of Strangers and a Kid he recognizes.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        What are you doing, Travis?\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        I been told to take your car in, Sir.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Why?\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        I dunno, Sir.

CHIEF'S OFFICE.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The man from the F.B.I. is 50. Black suit and wing tips. All F.\n     B.I. Investigators are either lawyers or accountants. And this\n     fellow looks like both. When he smiles it's a decaffeinated ex-\n     ercise. Bothers nothing but lips. This smile's always the same.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I want a 24 hour protection\n                        of Margie's house. Otherwise\n                        I'm not saying nothing. You\n                        give me that, or read me my\n                        rights, and talk to a lawyer.\n\n     BERLIN looks awful. Showered and shaved but just fucking awful.\n     CITRINE slips focus to the man. And St ANNE imperceptibly nods.\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        Alright, you got it.

They react to voice-levels\n     on a twin spool tape recorder. But no sound of yakking in here.\n     St Anne's ASSISTANT sucks a pencil. Busy with a cross-word puz-\n     zle. Fills in a word but the Camera isn't interested. It moves\n     away to discover head phones. And moves closer to hear St ANNE.\n\n                        [Always figured I'd like to retire\n                        to a little town like this - maybe\n                        buy a boat even, do some fishing?]\n\n     126:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     A change of chairs. A wood chair for the subject. Mobile chair\n     for the man. Castors give him considerable freedom. Enable him\n     to back off or move in with the intimacy of an ophthalmologist.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You fish, John?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I have done ..\n\n     A side table features several pin sharp pencils. A Sony pocket\n     recorder. Two packets of Pall Mall reds. Two yellow legal pads.\n     The chair moves into reverse and he breaks a puke colored file.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Alright, let's not beat about the\n                        bush, what ever that may mean, and\n                        get down on it.

(St Anne knows well which man.)\n\n                        Is this an interview, or an\n                        interrogation?\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        It's an enquiry ...\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm not prepared to be interrog-\n                        ated.

And\n                        I'm sure that's fine by your Chief.\n\n     He smiles the non-smile. Tosses his pencil down. And sits back.\n\n                        So you thought your man might show?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Yes.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Bit of a long-shot, wasn't it?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        It was the only shot I had ..\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        So the one night you decide to\n                        go up there, he goes up there?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        That's right.

I knew\n                        there was something missing.\n\n     St ANNE cuts him off to pick up the phone. Obviously something\n     vital is needed. \"Could you bring an an ashtray in here? Got a\n     coupla guys who smoke in here.\" And attention back to the file.\n\n                        You don't mind if I jump around a\n                        little this morning, do you?

POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The lights on the Christmas tree are off. That just about sums\n     it up. The word's out and it talks in barren silence as BERLIN\n     appears. TAYLOR and SERATO in conference at a desk. The former\n     looks. The latter turns away. BERLIN walks the room into close-\n     up. \"Like some coffee, John?\" Seems like ANN is the only benev-\n     olent face around. She gets a lost smile & bewildered shake of\n     his head. Disappears into his room And quietly closes the door.\n\n     130:  INT.  CRIME LAB.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     A picture of Ross fills the frame. Snapped the day they search-\n     ed the dump. Blasted with rain. A waterproof cape and a finger\n     raised in defiance. BERLIN shifts eyes from the bulletin board.\n     Pours a last inch of whisky and drinks. Eyes back to the board\n     for a last photographic/panoramic record of his time in Eureka.\n\n     The photo of Ross again before his eyes sweep quickly on. Pict-\n     ure of Amber Stone. Thumb tacks and maps and tape. Information \n     relating to specific areas in San Diego. Carlsbad/Ocean Beach/\n     Point Loma. \"Jennifer Seven\" \"Jennifer Eight.\" But who gives a\n     fuck anymore? Two dead dogs on a refuse dump. And now the dead\n     face of a Dummy. BERLIN stares till someone knocks on the door.\n     St ANNE comes in smoking a cigarette and eating a ham sandwich.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You go home, John, get some sleep.\n                        I don't wanna talk any more today.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Aren't you gonna arrest me?\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You know better than that ...\n\n     He will exit when he stops speaking. Before he does he wanders\n     the lab showing particular interest in the Dummy of Jennifer 8.\n\n                        I arrest you, you'll get bail, and\n                        be walking outta here anyway - and\n                        I'll have no one to talk to - Your\n                        Chief said he'd make you available\n                        to me. If you go to the store, call\n                        in, and let your duty officer know.\n\n     131:  INT.  BOBBY'S BEDROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  NIGHT.\n\n     BOBBY is in hysterics. A gale of tears. Fits his words between\n     them. His Mom does her best to cope with his grief and her own.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Your Daddy would have wanted\n                        you to be strong ..

Why did she have\n                        to come here .. I want my Daddy ..\n\n     132:  INT.  KITCHEN.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.\n\n     Fingers search out and identify phone numbers. Dial for inform-\n     ation and HELENA whispers \"I need the number for a cab, please.\"\n\n     133:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The Camera's getting closer and so is St ANNE. And today there\n     is a definite change of mood. Still very measured. Still a pro-\n     fessional demeanor. But a bad sense of shit about to come down.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        .. there was a gale that night .. all\n                        the doors are swinging .. so this door\n                        swings back and clips you .. and down\n                        you go .. within 35 seconds of uncon-\n                        sciousness, you're back on the fire es-\n                        cape, and you're confused, really con-\n                        fused .. you don't know if Tuesdays\n                        come in two's or happen once a week ..\n\n     Bit of a cold coming on and near enough for BERLIN to catch it.\n\n                        You see a figure coming up the stairs.\n                        Ross ain't meant to be on the stairs?\n                        He challenges you .. and this ain't a\n                        piece of wood with a nail through it ..\n                        this guy's got a 12 gauge Winchester\n                        up your nose .. and he's drunk .. and\n                        you're dizzy .. and your eye's fulla\n                        blood .. you ain't thinking good, and\n                        you're seeing worse .. Wow! .. it just\n                        went off! .. You just put him down? ..\n                        and you get hit by a Glaser, you stay\n                        down .. But he ain't dead .. Now, you\n                        realize you shot your partner .. \"Oh,\n                        Suzanna, how do I get outta this?\" I\n                        know .. The \"Serial Killer\" shot him ..\n                        And here comes the malice, John .. 17\n                        seconds later, you put another one in\n                        his throat .. Isn't that what happened?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Tell us what happened, then?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I already told you what happened ..\n                        You're looking for an inconsisten-\n                        cy, and you're not gonna find one,\n                        because I'm telling you the truth.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Tell me the truth again.\n\n     134:  EXT.  TRACK/FRONT YARD.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     A yellow cab splashes through puddles and pulls up in front of\n     the house. HELENA gets out and pays. No she doesn't need assis-\n     tance. Picks up her suitcase and the cab vanishes into drizzle.\n\n     135:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Back door opens and HELENA walks in. First thing she senses is\n     cold. This place smells like it hasn't been lived in since she\n     was last here. And last time she was here she was happy. Dumps\n     her case and heads for the living room. Can't see it but feels\n     the overwhelming gloom. Finds a couch and now she sits to wait.\n\n     The silence is almost total. But something disturbs it. HELENA\n     looks around. Back on her feet she tries to discover source of\n     the sound. Finally arrives at a table lamp. She feels the bulb\n     and it's hot. A large moth beats itself crazy inside the shade.\n     Reaches in and turns it off & the house is in virtual darkness.\n\n     136:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     St ANNE lights a cigarette. Attention with his notes. Sniffing\n     a fair bit. He's acquired a toilet roll to deal with it. Occas-\n     ionally will tear a sheet or two off to blow his nose. Glances\n     at BERLIN \"You want a cigarette?\" No he doesn't \"I've given up.\"\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You have? .. How about the booze? ..\n\n     How does St ANNE know? Perhaps he doesn't? Sounds like he does.\n\n                        Too much booze can be very dangerous ..\n                        memory black outs .. stuff like that ..\n\n     His attention still with notes like a quack about to prescribe.\n\n                        \"The Man Takes a Drink, Then the Drink\n                        Takes a Drink, Then the Drink Takes\n                        the Man?\" .. Something like that, isn't\n                        it? ..

Which\n                        floor did the elevator run up to?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Five.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You ran up to the fifth? You must\n                        have been real breathless by then?\n\n     BERLIN doesn't know where this is going but he doesn't like it.\n     Eyes to BERLIN now and his smile looks real for the first time.\n\n                        We're gonna get our \"observer\" in\n                        here this afternoon. Keep an eye\n                        on us? (He smiles) Notorious for\n                        withholding information, the F.B.I.\n\n     St ANNE makes a note. Junks the pencil. Sits back in his chair.\n\n                        Were you aware there was a janit-\n                        or in the institute that night?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        You didn't check?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        There wasn't time ...\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        That wasn't my question?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No, Sir, I didn't check.\n\n     St ANNE breaks off to blow his nose. BERLIN looks very worried.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        I'm really catching cold up\n                        here? Must be all this fog?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        What's the relevance of the janitor?\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        The janitor? Let me just ask you\n                        a question - before I forget - do\n                        you take any medication for that?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        For what?\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Breathlessness?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Alright, let me answer your question?\n                        \"What's the relevance of the janitor?\"\n\n     Hits the cigarette like this is the one that caused the cancer.\n\n                        Why don't I take you through it, from\n                        where I'm sitting .. At some time bet-\n                        ween 2 & 2:30 a.m. the janitor thought\n                        he heard a vehicle approaching through\n                        the woods. He looks out, and sees noth-\n                        ing, no lights, nothing. Figures it must\n                        be hunters. Some time later, he thought\n                        he heard something else, like a door, or\n                        a window slam? He gets up, and between\n                        half past two and a quarter of three, he\n                        makes a search - with a flashlight - of\n                        the top 3 floors. Finds nothing untoward,\n                        & goes back to his apartment in the roof.\n\n     BERLIN looks grey as sick. Knows what's coming. And here it is.\n\n                        The flashlight you saw, was his. The\n                        \"footsteps\" you heard, were his. The\n                        elevator you were chasing up and down\n                        after was empty, and is prone to such\n                        activity, due to an electrical fault ..\n                        Apparently it happens frequently dur-\n                        ing gales. The gale that was swinging\n                        the door. That knocked you down. That\n                        confused you so much? And here we are,\n                        back to where I'm sitting. You wanna\n                        tell me what really went on that night?\n\n     It seems St ANNE has effectively destroyed the \"Serial Killer\"\n     scenario. Stubs his cigarette and waits for BERLIN's response.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Two people know I didn't kill\n                        him, Mr St Anne. One's me, and\n                        the other's the man that did.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        What man?\n\n     St ANNE is winning. And they both know it. And he almost grins.\n\n                        We just dealt with \"the man?\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        How d'you know the Jan-\n                        itor didn't shoot him?\n\n     If St ANNE can raise an eyebrow he does. By implication BERLIN is\n     ditching his \"Killer.\" During this St ANNE rewinds his Sony.\n\n                        You're telling me it's his\n                        flashlight I saw, O.K., he\n                        sees my flashlight? And I'm\n                        coming up the stairs with a\n                        Beretta in my hand. And he's\n                        frightened. He hits the door\n                        on me. Picks up my gun. He's\n                        running. He runs into Ross,\n                        and in panic, he shoots him.\n\n     The little Sony snaps to a stop and St ANNE looks at his watch.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Not unless he had a gun in one\n                        hand, and a phone in the other,\n                        he didn't. Ross was shot at ex-\n                        actly two fifty-seven a.m. The\n                        janitor put a call through to\n                        the local police, at 2:57 a.m.\n                        You obviously realize how I can\n                        get so accurate with my timing?\n\n     St ANNE backs off and carefully replaces the Sony on the table.\n\n                        Ross switched into channel 8, &\n                        we got a recording of the whole\n                        incident. I was gonna play it to\n                        you, but I got a meeting, we'll\n                        have to do it after lunch. It's\n                        one, let's make it back by three?\n\n     137:  INT.  BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA is curled up under blankets. Maybe day-dreaming but not\n     asleep. She's maybe here to keep warm as much as anything else.\n     Sound of a vehicle approaching and she sits to listen. The car\n     pulls up and its engine silences. HELENA is already out of bed.\n\n     138:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/PORCH/FRONT YARD.  HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     Silhouette of a figure outside the front door. Someone rattles\n     the handle but it's locked. And by the time HELENA reaches the\n     door the visitor has gone. Thinking it's Berlin she twists the\n     key and steps onto the porch. A stale winter fog settling down.\n\n     Hardly a sound except her own voice. \"John? Is that you?\" Just\n     the rattle of local Crows and a Bull heaving somewhere in some\n     distant field. \"John?\" She cautiously descends wood stairs and\n     walks two or three paces before bumping into a brown Chevrolet.\n\n     Exploration of the car establishes nil. More confused than con-\n     cerned she listens. Country sound and not a sound out of place\n\n     Then suddenly she is alert. Something clatters somewhere. Like\n     cans kicked in the garage? Was it the garage? \"John, is it you?\"\n\n     139:  INT.  KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA locks the front door. Moves into the kitchen. Locks the\n     back door. Glum silence in the house. Nothing but an old alarm\n     clock ticking. Then a sound like something moving. Like a door\n     creaking open? Was it in the garage? The living room? Upstairs?\n\n     She returns to the living room. Curtains drawn and almost dark.\n     The endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes.\n     If anybody's here they're upstairs? HELENA moves to the bottom\n     of them \"John, are you up there? It's me, darling. I got a cab.\"\n\n     The only reply is more silence. She begins to climb the stairs.\n\n     One hand on the wall. She ascends slowly. Her helplessness giv-\n     ing way to suspicion with each new step. At the top she pushes\n     into the bedroom \"John, are you here? Darling? Are you alright?\"\n\n     Apparently no one is here. Certainly no one in the bed. And no\n     one in the bathroom. She reappears with an expression suppress-\n     ing anxiety. Feels her way past an antique wardrobe. Curiously\n     its door is open. A full length mirror inside. Shuts it as she\n     passes and for a split-instant the Man in the room is revealed.\n\n     Almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist.\n     HELENA in speechless with shock. Both she and the INTRUDER are\n     breathing hard. The only other sound is the wardrobe door whin-\n     ing open again under its weight. Manifests a reflection of his\n     back. Totally in black. Black wool hat. Leather jacket. Gloves.\n\n                                 INTRUDER\n                        Got really fucken lucky, didn't ya?\n\n     He backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip.\n     The frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still\n     on the INTRUDER's back. HELENA stares unseeing at her own face.\n\n                        I was getting kinda concerned about\n                        you Jenny. Like, how blind are you?\n                        Blind as your friend? Or less blind?\n                        Coz she could see, you know. Had a\n                        view outta one of em. But you don't\n                        see nothing do you? Nothing at all?\n\n     He reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife.\n     Even closed this thing is 10 inches long. A leather loop attat-\n     ched at one and. He teases the metal in front of HELENA's eyes.\n\n                        Can you see this, blind girl?\n\n     Not a switch-blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out.\n\n                        Gimme your hand.\n\n     Too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him.\n\n                        Gimme your fucken hand.\n\n     HELENA lifts her hand and he takes it. He runs the edge of the\n     blade over her palm. Then closes her fingers around the handle.\n\n                        You like it?\n\n     She is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks.\n\n                        I cut your friend's\n                        head off with that ..\n\n     Words come out she can barely hear herself. \"You are a coward.\"\n\n                        You say something, Jenny?\n                        \n     In this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol.\n\n                        I'd like to cut you. I'd like to\n                        cut you so bad .. But ain't life\n                        strange? You're my little buddy\n                        now .. I guess we all got lucky?\n\n     140:  EXT.  CAR PARK.  POLICE STATION.  CITY OF EUREKA.  DAY.\n\n     Fog and dusk in that order. Headlights descend the slope. Park\n     and CITRINE plus cane get out. As he crosses the lot a Uniform\n     fires up a Harley. Next face is SERATO heading for his car. He\n     accosts the Chief with a piece of paper. It is read with escal-\n     ating incredulity. This would be comic if it wasn't so serious.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        She's in love with him,\n                        Chief, and try anything?\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        Are you going up there?\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        No, I just sent Travis.\n                        I've got a call to make.\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        What about the man? .. Has he\n                        seen this? .. [No he hasn't] ..\n                        Alright, make your call, and\n                        get up there ... Bullshit or\n                        not, I wanna proper statement ..\n\n     141:  INT.  ANTI ROOM/INTERROGATION.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     CITRINE walks in in his overcoat. BISLEY looks across from the\n     window. And the ASSISTANT up from a crossword. \"Are they busy?\"\n\n                                 ASSISTANT\n                        No, Sir, they just got back.\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        Would you ask Mr St Anne\n                        to come in here a moment?\n\n     The ASSISTANT does it via phone. And BISLEY looks over unhappy.\n\n                                 BISLEY\n                        I hear I've been nominated\n                        as an official \"observer?\"\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        It's either you, or Taylor?\n\n                                 BISLEY\n                        He don't wanna do it either.\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        I'll toss a coin for you. But\n                        one of you is going in today ..\n\n     St ANNE comes in blowing his nose. CITRINE shoves him the mess~\n     age. He reads it with similar incredulity (but perhaps a touch\n     more amusement than Citrine) \"What d'you wanna do with it, Sir?\"\n\n                        What do you wanna do with it?\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Let him have it .. I don't\n                        mind putting a little salt\n                        at the edge of his plate ..\n\n     142:  EXT.  FRONT YARD.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  DUSK.\n\n     A single light in a downstairs room. The house is stifled with\n     fog. A brown police Chevy parked out front. Here comes another\n     to join it. As BERLIN gets out SERATO appears on the porch. He\n     descends stairs with the impartial expression of a working cop.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I need a friend, Angelo.\n\n     SERATO keeps it dispassionate. Ignores BERLIN's desperate eyes.\n\n                                 SERATO\n                        You got one.\n\n     Puts a thumb towards the house and already heading for his oar.\n\n                        She's a bad witness, John.\n                        But a fucking lousy alibi.\n\n     143:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     This isn't a good place to be. A dismal lamp supplies light. A\n     close-up Of HELENA on the sofa. Hears a sound of booze getting\n     poured. But nothing else in the house except for a harsh voice.\n\n                                 BERLIN (O.S.)\n                        .. I know why you did it darlin,\n                        but you're not helping me. Every-\n                        thing they're hearing they think\n                        is a lie. Now here comes the man\n                        I'm desperate to prove exists, &\n                        whadda-ya-know, he turns up at my\n                        house, and has a \"chat\" with you?\n\n     By now BERLIN and his glass of anaesthetic are well into frame.\n\n                        No one in the State of California\n                        is gonna believe that. They got the\n                        man in there - an A/1 F.B.I. inter-\n                        rogator, and he's taking me to pie-\n                        ces - doesn't believe a word comes\n                        outta my head - not a word - no one\n                        believes me - I don't believe me ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Don't say that. Don't you dare\n                        say that .. I believe you  ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I know you're trying to help\n                        me, but you don't understand.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Then explain it to me. I got\n                        enough darkness, don't I?\n\n     He doesn't want to. But now he's got to. And so here it comes.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        The man who killed Amber is a\n                        psychopath. He was up at the in-\n                        stitute to kill you - he don't\n                        wanna kill Rose - he was there\n                        to kill you - that's the truth -\n                        and I didn't wanna tell it to\n                        you - but that's the reason I\n                        want you to stay at Margie's -\n                        coz I can't protect you here ..\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Why does he want to kill me?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Coz he thinks you're a witness.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I can't identify him ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        He don't know that. I didn't.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Then why didn't he kill me?\n\n     Back at the booze and he's almost inaudible \"Stop it, will you?\"\n\n                        Why didn't he kill me, John?\n\n     Something snaps in BERLIN and he throws his glass at the grate.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Will you fucken stop it. I'm not\n                        Serato .. He didn't kill you coz\n                        he wasn't here .. he isn't in the\n                        room with you, and lets you live ..\n\n     And just as suddenly he's full of remorse. Takes HELENA in his\n     arms with a lot of sorrys. But she isn't interested in apology. \n     There's a passion in her face. And fire even in her blind eyes.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        Kiss me, John .. Kiss me [he does]\n                        I love you, kiss me again [he does]\n                        I love you .. Are my lips lying to\n                        you? Kiss my mouth [he does] Is my\n                        mouth lying to you?  He. Was. Here.\n\n     144:  INT.  GARAGE.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Music slams in on the cut. Berlin is about to take this garage\n     to pieces. He searches cans and boxes and stacked timber. What\n     ever it is his eyes are looking. The Camera looks down from ab-\n     ove. Bits & pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing.\n\n     145:  INT.  BATHROOM/BEDROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Close on a hand searching underside of the bath. Pipes and cob-\n     webs. He reaches toward the taps. His hand is literally inches\n     from the Walther (taped to the end of the tub). Fingers almost\n     touch it. Just a fingernail away when HELENA interrupts \"John?\"\n\n                                 HELENA (O.S.)\n                        I just remembered something ..\n\n     And BERLIN rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car.\n\n                        He used a breath freshener.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        A \"breath freshener?\"\n\n     HELENA stands in the doorway and BERLIN is already on his feet.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I heard it hiss, twice.\n\n     BERLIN wipes a thought through his hair with fingers. \"I don't\n     know what that means.\" Walks past into the bedroom. Everything\n     taken apart. Every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        ... he's either here to take\n                        something .. or leave some-\n                        thing .. I don't find nothing ..\n\n     146:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN pours last of the whisky. Looks totally snuffed out. He\n     and HELENA sit on the same sofa but the atmosphere puts them a\n     mile apart. A yellow pad on the table covered in notes. BERLIN\n     swallows scotch and reads to himself \"I guess we all got lucky?\"\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        You gotta stop drinking, darling.\n\n     Another mouthful of scotch & she hears the glass hit the table.\n\n                        He's glad you're drinking. Every\n                        drink you take you're helping him.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        He doesn't need my help.\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I know about alcohol, John.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        You do?\n\n                                 HELENA\n                        I'm blind because my father drank.\n\n     That's what she knows about alcohol and he'd prefer to be dead.\n\n                        I lost everyone I ever loved .. I\n                        lost my hopes .. my future .. I'm\n                        in love with you, John .. I don't\n                        want them to take you away from me ..\n\n     147:  INT.  INTERROGATION ROOM.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     St ANNE is close enough to kiss BERLIN. Right into his space &\n     talking right into his face. And today he's not in a good mood.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        He humiliated you. In front of every\n                        one .. In front of a bunch of secret-\n                        aries? .. Well, that would piss any-\n                        one off? ...

You don't\n                        go bitchin on them behind their back?\n\n     And he suddenly switches gear. And whispers like it's a secret.\n\n                        He wasn't much of a \"friend\" at all?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Ross was my best friend.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Did you shoot your \"best friend?\"\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        No.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        The next time I ask you that quest-\n                        ion, you're gonna tell me the truth.\n\n     St ANNE shunts back in his chair. Expands the frame as he goes.\n     Sergeant TAYLOR sits on a chair with his back to the wall. Cig-\n     arettes and ashtray on the table next to his.

They're full of hate.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        If you find him, John. I want you\n                        to call me. I wanna know his name.\n\n     153:  EXT.  HILLSIDE.  OAKLAND.  DAY.\n\n     Wide over the bay area. Wind swept and rain swept. City lights\n     beginning to come on. In the distance the docks and far beyond\n     the ocean. Somewhere here is a solitary phone booth. \"I'm look-\n     ing for a special type of rattan .. friend of mine recommended\n     you, said I should ask for someone called Amanda .. You don't?\n     O.K. .. Thank you.\" Followed by sound of a phone slamming down.\n\n     154:  INT.  PHONE BOOTH.  HILLSIDE STREET.  DAY.\n\n     A stack of coins and a pair of ripped out Yellow Pages. BERLIN\n     crosses off another number. Running out of craft shops and run-\n     ning out of quarters. A new number hears the same old bullshit.\n     But this one is answering good! Fights to keep his voice light.\n\n                                 BERLIN (Phone)\n                        She's not there? - Let me just make\n                        sure I got the right Amanda - lotta\n                        freckles, right? .. Right .. That's\n                        right, that's her .. Well, eh, what\n                        time d'you expect her? .. O.K. I'll\n                        eh, try and pop over this afternoon.\n\n     And he comes out of there running. The Chevy roars up the hill.\n\n     155:  INT.  ANTIQUE MARKET.  CRAFT EMPORIUM.  DUSK.\n\n     The kind of store heads open in abandoned warehouses. A jungle\n     of jewelry and cane furniture and ethnic junk.  Many chairs of\n     the ilk Berlin saw in the Volkswagen van. And now he's staring\n     at its driver. His P.O.V. through windows. He watches as a red\n     headed Girl clears the till in preparation to close up. within\n     moments the lights are dead and AMANDA is heading for her door.\n\n     156:  EXT.  MARKET/WAREHOUSE.  CAR PARK.  DUSK.\n\n     Plenty of rain to hurry in. AMANDA. drives a red Datsun. She ex-\n     its the car park with a man in a brown Chevrolet following her.\n\n     157:  EXT/INT.  CAR/STREETS.  SUBURBS.  OAKLAND.  NIGHT.\n\n     The Chevy tails the Datsun through city streets. A lot of rush\n     hour traffic. Music to go with it and it's probably Mussorgsky.\n\n     A final cut and headlights are navigating the hills. Disappear\n     and reappear as they ascend. Steep inclines and the houses are\n     middle class. Too dark to see much now but lamp posts and rain.\n\n     Still climbing the Datsun takes a side street. BERLIN keeps 50\n     yards behind. She turns off and parks in a sloping driveway. A\n     white Volkswagen van at the top of it. BERLIN has already pull-\n     ed over. Kills his lights and watches her hurry into the house.\n\n     158:  EXT.  STEEP STAIRS.  PORCH.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN just rang the doorbell. Imposes an impartial expression.\n     But this is his last chance and he knows it. The front door is\n     opened & secured on a safety-chain. AMANDA carries a white Cat.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm sorry to trouble you, but eh ..\n                        Wait a minute, don't I know you?\n\n     And she stares like he does not. Before she stares like he does.\n\n                        You're Amanda? Remember, you near-\n                        ly ran into me? Way up in Trinity?\n\n     His smile disarms the securities. And she opens the front door.\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        As I said, Sergeant, you nearly\n                        ran into me? What's the problem?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm afraid it's the \"van\" again.\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        The van?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Is it your vehicle?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        No, my mother's .. You better stop\n                        in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.\n\n     159:  INT.  HALLWAY.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     So far so good. Inside without showing an I.D. he doesn't have.\n     This is a gloomy place. She shuts the door. Shuts out the gale.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'm sorry to worry you with this, but\n                        we had a real serious robbery, and we-\n                        're chasing a white V.W. van? You guy\n                        came up an the computer, so as a matt-\n                        er of routine we have to check. Could\n                        you tell me who's driven it recently?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        Only me and Mom ..\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        How about any guys on your staff?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        We only got one .. He doesn't drive.\n\n                                 BERLIN [AMANDA]\n                        Would he have lent it to anyone? [No]\n                        How bout your Dad? Husband? Boyfriend?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        He is my boyfriend. My fath-\n                        er's dead, and I'm divorced.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I see ...\n\n     His hopes are collapsing by the moment and nothing else is left.\n\n                        Would you mind if I took a look at it?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        I thought this was \"routine?\"\n\n     The Cat cries for its food and AMANDA begins to look suspicious.\n\n                        The only man that has driven it in\n                        the last 6 months is my uncle. And\n                        no way is he involved in a robbery.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Could I have his name? Just so\n                        I can officially eliminate him?\n\n     Maybe too much charge in his head and she doesn't like the vibe?\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                        Could I see your badge again?\n\n     Sure she can and he searches for it. \"Must have left it at home?\"\n\n                        Then you better go and get it. I\n                        feel uncomfortable without an I.D.\n\n     AMANDA opens the front door just long enough for BERLIN to leave.\n\n     160:  INT.  LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN.  HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     The emerging Music is full of threat. Like it's part of the dark-\n     ness. Too dark to see much of anything here. A sound of somebody \n     hammering at a door. A light outside and the Camera moves closer. \n     Creeps towards the door as though it's going to answer. Suddenly\n     glass shatters. The door flies open. Flashlights and Men rush in.\n\n     161.  INT.  CHEVROLET SEDAN.  STREET.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN stares towards the house. Music and rain and a downstairs\n     light just wont out. Headlights go on and the Datsun drives away.\n\n     162:  INT.  CHIMNEY FLUE/BEDROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A flashlight searches cobwebs and soot. Descends the chimney and\n     TAYLOR emerges from a long-sealed-off fireplace. Blinks dirt out\n     of his eyes and moves back into the bedroom. Upended bed against\n     the wall and everything upsidedown. The search looks like it has\n     been thorough. St ANNE appears at the door and TAYLOR looks over.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        We're not gonna find nothin here.\n\n     163:  INT.  MASTER BEDROOM.  (AMANDA'S) HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     BERLIN searches the bedroom. Anxiety and antiques. Does a vanity\n     and now a wardrobe. Nothing much in either. But finds a shoe box\n     full of letters in the latter. Postcards/birthday cards etcetera.\n\n     164:  INT.  BATHROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Half the floorboards already up. VENABLES levers at another. The\n     music is nervous and louder. Next floorboard is next to the bath.\n\n     165:  INT.  BEDROOM/WARDROBE.  (AMANDA'S) HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Big close on a postcard (a fantasy yacht on a blue sea). The cap-\n     tion reads \"JUST ANOTHER DAY IN SAN DIEGO.\" Close enough to read\n     the message \".. too hot .. asthma not too good .. as soon as I'm \n     settled I'll write .. love John ..\" Next letter out is also post-\n     marked San Diego. Inside is a happy snap of Sergeant John Taylor.\n\n     166:  INT.  BATHROOM.  BERLIN'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Almost too close to see what's happening. But a gloved hand just\n     found a pistol under the bath. Out it comes with BISLEY shouting.\n     And St ANNE and TAYLOR arrive. \"Got a little Walther. It's a 25.\"\n\n     167:  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA looks at the floor and listens. MARGIE looks at the T.V.\n     and listens. Big close on the screen. This scene will intercut\n     between the television and those in front of it as appropriate.\n\n     [1]  An exterior shot of Berlin's house. Sheriff's cars parked\n     out front. Various people come and go. One of them is Sergeant\n     Taylor. Perpetual wind on the sound track interrupted by a V.O.\n\n                                 MALE REPORTER\n                        Detectives spent several hours this\n                        morning at Sergeant Berlin's home ..\n                        various property was removed for ex-\n                        amination. Later in the morning, May-\n                        or Heineman arrived for a meeting with\n                        police officers from Shasta Valley ..\n\n     [2]  Heineman's B.M.W. pulls up outside the police station and\n     this is conducted on the move. A Reporter asks \"What's the nat-\n     ure of this meeting, Sir?\" HEINEMAN is sorry but can't comment.\n     He pauses briefly an the steps with the wind savaging his hair.\n\n                                 HEINEMAN (T.V.)\n                        Jim unable to say anything right now,\n                        except, this is a very sad and tragic\n                        day. John Berlin lied to us all. Lied\n                        to me, and much worse, lied to every\n                        man, woman, & child in this community ..\n\n                                 WOMAN REPORTER (T.V.)\n                        Where was Mr Berlin arrested, Sir?\n\n                                 HEINEMAN (T.V.)\n                        Near the Ross residence .. six a.m. ..\n\n                                 MALE REPORTER (T.V.)\n                        Who made the arrest?\n\n                                 HEINEMAN (T.V.)\n                        Sergeant John Taylor. Assist-\n                        ed by Sergeant Angelo Serato ..\n\n     HELENA looks in utmost despair. \"Is it true he resisted arrest?\"\n\n                        You'll have to put that question\n                        to the Chief. I've nothing to add.\n\n     BOBBY appears somewhere behind the Ladies. T.V. commentary con-\n     tinues. \"Meanwhile, Sergeant Berlin remains in a cell at police\n     headquarters arraigned on what is believed to be  a $500,000.00\n     bail. As Mayor Heineman said, this, is a 'sad day' for Eureka.\"\n     Except for the one face that isn't sad and it belongs to BOBBY.\n\n     168:  INT.  CORRIDOR/CELLS.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     The cell window is reinforced glass. BERLIN smashes on it like\n     an insane man. TRAVIS (apparently on cell duty) has never seen\n     nothing like this before. CITRINE doesn't want to see any more.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'll sign anything you want. Please.\n                        Bring here her .. I want Helena here ..\n\n                                 CITRINE\n                        You ain't talking to no\n                        one, till you calm down.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I am calm .. I am calm ..\n\n     But he isn't and CITRINE moves off. BERLIN cracks blood out of\n     knuckles on the glass. Hollers up the corridor after the Chief.\n\n                        Get St Anne .. I want St Anne ..\n\n     169:  EXT.  DRIVE.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.\n\n     Gale still making a mass of the trees. A police Chevy pulls up\n     and TAYLOR gets out. Puts a knuckle on the window of a black &\n     white. A Uniform wakes and TAYLOR interrupts his apologies \"Go.\"\n     And the young Cop does the drive as TAYLOR heads for the house.\n\n     170:  INT.  STAIRS/LIVING ROOM.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DAY.\n\n     HELENA descends the stairs with her luggage. She's towards the\n     bottom when TAYLOR appears via the kitchen. Lights momentarily\n     stall as the gale sucks their electricity. Ignorant of his pre-\n     sence she loses her bags and disappears into the den. He moves\n     after her and startles the shit out of MARGIE as she comes out.\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        Jesus. What are you doing here?\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Been trying to call, your line's\n                        down .. I just wanna let you know\n                        we're taking the guard off today.\n\n     MARGIE heads for a table and unloads a strong-box of documents.\n\n                        Is she going somewhere?\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        I'm taking her back to the Instit-\n                        ute. Her new term starts tomorrow.\n\n     He watches her select various papers aware of what she's about.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Not gonna try and bail him are you?\n                        I really wouldn't bother, Margie ..\n\n     HELENA reappears wearing a coat and TAYLOR is in generous mood.\n\n                        You want me to drive her? ..\n                        I'm through with my shift ..\n\n                                 MARGIE\n                        No .. I'll drive her ..\n\n     171:  INT.  CELL.  POLICE STATION.  DAY.\n\n     Here's a classic twenty-two. BERLIN is consumed with anxiety &\n     rage. But get mad in here and get nothing. No shoe strings and\n     no wrist watch. But a wrist-band like something medical summar-\n     izing his charge. St ANNE sits impassive as BERLIN walks floor.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        I'll sign anything you like - you\n                        write it, I'll sign it. But I want\n                        her and Margie here. I want an opp-\n                        ortunity to talk to them - that's\n                        all I'm asking? - That's my deal? ..\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        O.K. I'll put it to your Chief?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Well, you'd better put it to him\n                        pretty dammed quick, Mr St Anne,\n                        because if you don't, she's dead.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Didn't push her down stairs on\n                        their previous meeting, did he?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        He was up there to plant the gun.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        Did Taylor plant this, too?\n\n     Produces a Zippo in a plastic sack and BERLIN's senses capsize.\n\n                        Is it yours?\n\n     A question for which St ANNE expects no answer and he is right.\n\n                        We found \"Jennifer Eight.\" At least,\n                        we've found a headless and handless\n                        girl. A couple of hunters found her.\n\n     Maybe BERLIN asks him \"Where\" or maybe his expression's enough?\n\n                        About 4 miles south of the institute,\n                        less than 50 feet from the road. This\n                        was less than 100 feet from the body.\n\n     BERLIN can't believe it and knows St ANNE wouldn't believe him.\n\n                        Is it yours? - (no answer) - I know\n                        it's yours? - You know it's yours?\n                        The only prints on it are Freddy's?\n                        You wanna tell me how it got there?\n\n     BERLIN wouldn't believe it either. Door open and TRAVIS enters.\n\n                                 TRAVIS\n                        Margie Ross put up your bond, Sir.\n\n     St ANNE and BERLIN look surprised. And BERLIN looks at St ANNE.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Are you getting in the way of it?\n\n     St ANNE examines the bail/bond paper and raises eyes to BERLIN.\n\n                                 St ANNE\n                        I don't make the law.\n\n     172:  EXT.  THE ROSS RESIDENCE.  DUSK.\n\n     Music on the cut and this is a crane shot high above the house.\n     A car tears up the drive with the Camera descending to meet it.\n     BERLIN out and into the house. And still the gale howls around.\n\n     173:  INT.  DOWNSTAIRS ROOMS.  HOUSE.  DUSK.\n\n     Darkness and silence. Where the hell is everyone? He quicks it\n     to the den, Cartoons on T.V. but no one watching. With escalat-\n     ing concern he hits the kitchen and now he's shouting upstairs. \n     \"Margie. Margie.\" About to climb when BOBBY appears at the top.\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        There's no one here.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Where are they?\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        Mom took her back to the institute.\n\n     BERLIN freezes. He maybe says \"What?\" He definitely says \"When?\"\n\n                        I dunno. How come they let you out?\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Is Margie with her? Is she with her?\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        No, she came back and went out ag-\n                        ain .. gone to see Auntie Charles ..\n\n     BERLIN has already grabbed a telephone. Aware it's dead before\n     BOBBY tells him \"They're all out around here.\" He wanders down-\n     stairs in apparent oblivion to BERLIN's distress. BERLIN races\n     back to the den and new problems. Desperate to get at the guns\n     but all cabinets locked \"Where's the keys, Bobby? I need a gun.\"\n\n                        They're my Dad's guns.\n\n                                 BERLIN\n                        Come on, Bobby, for God's sake. I\n                        wanna get the man that killed him.\n\n     BOBBY stares at BERLIN as though he's staring at that very man.\n\n                                 BOBBY\n                        I hate you .. I really hate you ..\n\n     He turns away into the darkness. BERLIN looks frantic and with-\n     out options. Smashes the cabinets with a chair. Grabs a 44 rev-\n     olver plus a 12 gauge Remington and the slugs that go with it.\n\n     174:  EXT.  FREEWAY INTERSECTION.  NIGHT.\n\n     Wide over an intersection. Berlin's Chevy crosses a bridge and\n     descends into lights. Music travels with him but the Camera re-\n     mains static. Watches tail lights dissolve into a river of red.\n\n     175:  EXT.  FREEWAY.  NIGHT.\n\n     Tracking back with the car. As yet 100 yards away. Moving fast\n     and getting closer. As it approaches a remote sound of a phone\n     drifts in. And headlights so near now they wipe out everything.\n\n     176:  INT.  CHEVY SEDAN.  FREEWAY.  NIGHT.\n\n     Starting to sleet and windshield wipers on. The phone is still\n     ringing like it's at the end of Berlin's brain. Like it's part\n     of his thoughts mixed up with the nightmare he's hearing again.\n\n                                 BERLIN (V.O.)\n                        Go take a look in his office. It's\n                        fulla rattan - that's the connect-\n                        ion, that's the \"link\" - that's why\n                        they never got an I.D. - He kills\n                        blind girls - put their picture in\n                        the newspaper, and 99 percent of\n                        the people who know them are blind ..\n\n     Intercutting BERLIN's fearful eyes with his P.O.V. of the road.\n\n                                 St ANNE (V.O.)\n                        Havta be a real dope to kill her\n                        now, wouldn't he? I mean, we're\n                        talking real, full-blown, insane?\n\n                                 BERLIN (V.O.)\n                        He is insane. His fucken brain's\n                        upside down. But he's also very\n                        cunning. He's not going after her\n                        with a \"Pearl Handled Colt,\" he-\n                        'll just push her down the stairs ..\n\n     Just the sound of tho phone and the road dissolving into black.\n\n     177:  INT.  CORRIDOR.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A miserable corridor with the merest of lights. A phone rings\n     somewhere at its end. HELENA is on her way up the corridor and\n     the ringing is louder. Finds keys and walks into her apartment.\n\n     178:  INT.  APARTMENT.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Phone in close-up and the frame widens as HELENA heads towards\n     it. Reaches out and is maybe a second away before it rings off.\n\n     179:  INT/EXT.  PHONE BOOTH.  GAS STATION.  NIGHT.\n\n     This is a little country stop some place an the peripheries of\n     the snow-line. BERLIN slams the phone down and runs to his car.\n     Screeches out onto the highway and the Camera begins to ascend.\n\n     The Camera climbs higher revealing somber mountains. Plus mile\n     upon mile of road he has yet to travel. Still it ascends until\n     the Chevrolet is reduced to an insignificance by the landscape.\n\n     180:  EXT.  SHASTA-TRINITY INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     A panoramic over the institute wide enough to include surround-\n     ing forest. Headlights approach down a wooded track and go out.\n     Just possible to see a tiny Figure moving towards the building.\n\n     181:  EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     High on the fire escape looking down. A flashlight arrives bel-\n     ow. Eerie fragmentation of light as the Figure begins to climb.\n\n     182: EXT. CHEVY SEDAN/ROAD.  SHASTA VALLEY.  NIGHT.\n\n     The highway is winding and narrowed with snow. Couldn't find a\n     lousier road on which to overtake. BERLIN is right up behind a\n     forty ton truck and he's trying to overtake. Hits the horn and\n     tries again. Halfway past the trailer when a bend suddenly rel-\n     eases headlights. An angry claxon and he's forced to pull back.\n\n     183:  INT.  BEDROOM.  APARTMENT.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Although curtains are open the room is in darkness. Someone on\n     the fire escape looking in. A flashlight snaps on and a circle\n     of light explores the room. Creeps across the floor and pauses\n     at the bed. Climbs slowly to illuminate HELENA's sleeping face.\n\n     144:  EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     Close-up sound and close-up picture. A glass-cutter scores the\n     window. A nasty noise but you'd have to be wide awake and list-\n     ening to hear it. A gloved fist punches the section out. Falls\n     to the floor and shatters. And a hand reaches in for the catch.\n\n     145:  INT.  BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM.  APARTMENT.  NIGHT.\n\n     HELENA is wide awake and listening. Hurrying into her dressing\n     gown with a similar urgency to get out. She arrives in the liv-\n     ing room as the FIGURE is clambering through the window. Panic\n     as she blunders for the front door. Tears it open and vanishes\n     into the corridor. He crosses the room and follows her outside.\n\n     186:  INT.  CORRIDOR/STAIRS.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     HELENA knows the building and moves faster than he may have ex-\n     pected. Green dressing gown and bare feet. White nightgown and\n     blonde hair. The man in black hurries after her. She's already\n     at the swing doors and he's virtually running to stay with her.\n\n     She bursts through the doors and rushes downstairs. He follows\n     only seconds behind. The wind groans down as they descend. HEL-\n     ENA turns a corner of the stairwell and momentarily disappears.\n\n     For a moment he loses her! Which way did she go? Downstairs or\n     along the corridor? His anxiety is immediately assuaged. Spots\n     what already looks like a ghost fleeing into shadows. He takes\n     off along the corridor. Getting breathless. But getting closer.\n     Near enough now to sense her fear. Near enough now to grab her.\n\n                                 TAYLOR\n                        Say night, night, dead girl.\n\n     As he reaches for her she turns. MARGIE wears a green dressing\n     gown and a blonde wig and has a very big fucking pistol in her\n     hand. TAYLOR can't believe what he's looking at. And for an in-\n     stant neither does MARGIE. Their surprise is mutually stunning.\n\n     How can it be him? How can it be her? TAYLOR's still trying to\n     work out how they made the switch when the first bullet smacks\n     into his chest. Gets another as he goes down. He crumples in a\n     deadly heap and revenge is completed with two more in the back.\n\n     187:  INT.  LANDING/STAIRS.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARGIE barges through the doors. The MYOPIC Janitor is halfway\n     up adjacent stairs peering down. No time for introductions and\n     no time for explanations. \"Call the Police. Do it. Now.\" Shout-\n     ing up at him she's already descending. \"Tell em the gymnasium.\"\n\n     188:  INT.  GYMNASIUM.  INSTITUTE.  NIGHT.\n\n     MARGIE patrols plate glass windows. Where are the fucking cops?\n     She's shocked and looks strange indeed. Wig off but hair grips\n     all over her head. An overcoat and shoes but still wearing the\n     nightgown underneath. A couple of dreary lights in the ceiling.\n     HELENA sits numb under one of them all but hidden in a blanket.\n\n     MARGIE can't stand waiting any longer. \"I'm gonna call them my-\n     self.\" HELENA nods and sure she's O.K. to stay here. The doors\n     settle and she is alone. Headlights cross the windows shifting\n     the shadows of everything. Swooping the walls they move attent-\n     ion back to the door. TAYLOR stares in and then pushes through.\n\n     Worse for wear but very much alive. Discarded his leather jack-\n     et revealing the bullet proof vest. Blood all over his T-shirt.\n     Looks like he caught one in the shoulder. A bad burn and blood\n     runs from his left hand. In his right hand he clasps the knife.\n\n     He cracks it open like a whip. HELENA hears it and stands. Ter-\n     ror as the footsteps approach. \"Margie. Margie.\" But Margie is-\n     n't around. He's less than 30 feet away. She tries to back off\n     but is hindered by the blanket. Tries to scream but is stifled\n     with fear. Maybe six seconds to live but this refers to Taylor.\n\n     \"Taylor\" He swings around but this time he doesn't get time to\n     look surprised. BERLIN blows the fucker across the room. Solid\n     load slugs weighing an ounce each crash into him. BERLIN keeps\n     pumping the Remington and doesn't stop firing until the magaz-\n     ine is over. No conjecture now. This bastard is very much dead.\n\n     BERLIN throws the 12 gauge aside. And maybe it means something.\n     Maybe at last he accepts he's stopped living in that world and\n     ready to give himself a chance in this. HELENA in his arms and\n     this is his new world. Flashing lights and headlights flood in-\n     to the darkness. Their embrace goes on. And this story is told.\n\n                                 THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Eight\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Bruce Robinson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:28:19.008199"}
