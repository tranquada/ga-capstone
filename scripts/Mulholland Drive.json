A fire erupts in the sedan and as the dust clears we\nsee the woman appear, then crawl out of the Cadillac to the\nroad. Her face is vacant. There is a bleeding cut just above\nher forehead.

The woman then loses control and runs at the coyote\nand it races off. She falls to the ground. We can hear the\nthunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder.

He's\nsmoking a cigarette and is laughing at something the man at\nthe desk has said.

Ed's famous black book.\n\n<b>    \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tED\n</b>\t\tYeah, the history of the world in phone\n\t\tnumbers.\n<b>    \n</b>Joe's hand still at the small of his back moves into view\nholding a silenced pistol and in one swift move reaches out\nand fires a hole through Ed's temple - blowing Ed's brains\nout across the desk, carpet and wall. Ed's head bangs down\non the desk, then is still save the leaking of blood from the\nwounds. Joe flips his finished cigarette out the open window\nbehind Ed's desk, wipes the gun clean with a handkerchief and\nplaces the cleaned gun in Ed's right hand. He places Ed's\nright forefinger gently onto the trigger. As he puts the\nfinger on the trigger he presses a little too hard and the\ngun goes off. The bullet shoots out and penetrates the cheap\nwall at the far end of Ed's office. Joe hears a muffled\nscream.\n<b>    \n</b>\t\t\t\tJOE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t(disgusted with himself)\n\t\tOh...man!\n<b>    \n</b>With a sense of \"just more stuff I got to do\" Joe moves\nslowly and begrudgingly out of Ed's office, checks the\ncorridor and goes toward the screaming which still persists.\nHe opens up the office door next to Ed's and finds a heavy\nset woman screaming bloody murder as she is grabbing her\nbuttock and lower back. He sighs and walks over to her and\ncups his hand tightly around her mouth to squelch the\nscreaming. Wide-eyed, she tries to fight him off and he\nbegins dragging her out of her office. Joe's foot catches on\na computer cable clumsily taped across the floor and he falls\nbackwards bringing the heavy woman down with a bone-crushing\nblow on top of him. The woman begins beating his face with\nher meaty fists. Joe snaps her head back, instantly stilling\nher violent activity. He wrestles the stunned heavyweight\nback to her feet and out her door. He pushes and pulls her\ninto Ed's office. Just before they enter, Joe notices a man\nwith a vacuum cleaner watching him from the far end of the\ncorridor. He stops and calls to the man.\n<b>    \n</b>\t\t\t\tJOE (cont'd)\n\t\tHey man. She's hurt bad. Get down here\n\t\tand use the phone. Help me out.

She's\n\t\thurt and I can't do everything myself,\n\t\tman.\n\n<b>    \n</b>Joe pushes the woman inside Ed's office, throws a glance back\ndown the corridor and sees the man is on his way to him,\npushing his industrial vacuum and trailing a 200 ft. long\nthick black cord as he goes. Joe goes in to Ed's office\nwith the woman. He throws her down on the floor in line\nbetween Ed's desk and the bullet hole in the wall. She\nstarts screaming immediately and struggles to get up. Joe\ngrabs the pistol from Ed's dead hand and lifts it to fire,\nbut the woman has turned around and is almost standing.\n<b>    \n</b>\t\t\t\tJOE (cont'd)\n\t\tNo, no, no. You gotta be turned around.\n<b>    \n</b>He goes to her, slaps her hard in the face and spins her\naround. Before she can turn again Joe races back to place\nhimself in the proper line at Ed's desk and quickly fires two\nsilenced shots into the back of her head. The man with the\nvacuum enters. His eyes begin to widen in reaction to the\nscene. Just then Joe fires a bullet into the man's chest.\nThe man inadvertently flicks on the vacuum cleaner as his\nhands rush up to the wound. As the vacuum cleaner whines Joe\nrushes to the man before the man falls back out into the\ncorridor. He pulls him into the room - the man moaning and\nclutching his chest, starting to collapse. Joe releases him\nand the man goes down. The vacuum cleaner seems to be\nscreeching now in the threshold. Joe fires the last bullet\ninto the heavy duty vacuum cleaner. The bullet shorts out\nthe internal wiring of the vacuum. That in turn blows the\nbuilding's circuit breaker and all the lights go out.\n<b>    \n</b>\t\t\t\tJOE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t(disgusted with himself)\n\t\tOh ... man!\n<b>    \n</b>Now he hears voices - voices moving into the corridor.\n<b>    \n</b><b>\t\t\t\tVOICES\n</b>\t\tWhat the hell .... what happened?

It's the vacuum.\n\t\tIt's the vacuum what did it.\n<b>    \n</b>Joe cleans the pistol once again and places it back in\nEddie's hand - Eddie's finger on the trigger.

We hear strings soar up and the blonde girl\nbegins to sing SIXTEEN REASONS by Connie Stevens. The male\nvocalists backing her up flawlessly.\n\nWe move back and realize we are on a movie set inside a sound\nstage. A screen test is being shot of the girl and as we\ncontinue moving back we see the director Adam Kesher\nsurrounded by his crew. Behind them there are many people\nstanding, eating, watching, working. The stage is full and\nbustling. The song plays loudly over. Sarah and Nicki bring\nBetty into this scene through a giant stage door. A guard\nmimes for them to be quiet as they approach the set. The\nsong continues to play over.\n\nAs Sarah leads Betty up close Adam turns and his eyes fall on\nthe beautiful face of Betty Elms. Sensing something Betty\nturns and sees Adam. They each seem to feel the thrill of\nthe thunderbolt, but each embarrassed to stare longer than\nthey already have turn back and watch the girl finish the\nsong.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tADAM\n</b>\t\t\t(calling out through an\n\t\t\telectronic megaphone)\n\t\tCut it!\n<b>    \n</b>He gets out of his chair and walks into the set - up to the\nblonde girl.

Great chunks of mattress are standing upright\nhaving been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. A dried sea of\nblood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. The\nscream comes out of Rita as a force propelling her to look\ncloser. Betty lunges after Rita, her eyes also not able to\nleave the sight. She covers Rita's mouth with her hand and\nbrings her close. The scream is stifled by Betty's hand.\n<b>    \n</b>In the silence that follows, knocking can be heard.
