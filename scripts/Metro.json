Just the truck.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         I certainly wouldn't.\n\n               He says it as if the very idea disturbs him. He turns away \n               from the window. Baffert feigns a coughing spell.\n\n                                     BAFFERT\n                         Could I please have a little water?\n\n                                     KORDA\n                              (the perfect host)\n                         Of course.\n\n               Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an \n               opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.\n\n                                     BAFFERT\n                         The reason I'm asking you is because \n                         we arrested him with some stolen \n                         jewelry. It was traced to the robbery \n                         of a store down on Polk Street. He \n                         said he was fencing it for you.\n\n               Baffert notices something in the trash can.\n\n               HIS POV\n\n               Several glassine envelopes used for raw jewels. They have \n               jeweler's markings on them indicating gem weight and grade.\n\n               INT. KITCHEN\n\n               Korda, pouring the water, notices Baffert's discovery, but \n               his face betrays nothing.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                              (calmly)\n                         There's obviously some mistake.

Korda is still holding the \n               water.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         Your cough seems to be better.\n\n               A real repressed tension here.

Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts \n               the glass down on the table.\n\n                                     BAFFERT\n                         Well, I'm on my way to the game. I \n                         appreciate your cooperation, Mr. \n                         Korda.\n\n               Korda smiles. Baffert walks to the door.

HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Baffert gets into the elevator.\n\n               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT\n\n               Baffert takes out his cell phone.

This is \n                         Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a \n                         suspect's residence. I'm requesting \n                         a telephonic search warrant in \n                         connection with an armed robbery at \n                         a jewelry store. There's visible \n                         evidence on the premises. Glassine \n                         envelopes with jeweler's markings \n                         were seen in the trash can...\n\n               The elevator hits the first floor.\n\n                                     BAFFERT\n                         ...I believe a full search of the \n                         premises will turn up some stolen \n                         property...\n\n               The elevator opens.\n\n               Korda is standing there with a knife.\n\n               Baffert has no time to react...\n\n               The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and \n               slashing across the throat.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, \n               returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any \n               particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her \n               groceries enters the building.\n\n               Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.\n\n               INT. BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his \n               neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look \n               good.\n\n               The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first \n               flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes \n               by her up the stairs.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (to the woman)\n                         Get an ambulance!\n\n               INT. THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Roper arrives at the top of the stairs. Korda's door is ajar. \n               Duke Ellington can be heard faintly.\n\n               INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT\n\n               Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... \n               No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a \n               door. Roper races out.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it \n               open. Gun aimed.\n\n               INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT\n\n               A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds \n               up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he \n               leaves.\n\n               EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT\n\n               Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. \n               Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that \n               Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.\n\n               INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN\n\n               Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window \n               looking out to the rain.

He exits.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               INT. METRO OFFICE AREA - NIGHT\n\n               Two detectives.

Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's \n               ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch \n               and his head in Roper's lap.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Hey, Troy.

She wants to, but she won't do it. \n               She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Oh, hell, forget it.

Ronnie \n               makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him \n               to follow Roper.

He just goes.\n\n               EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING\n\n               A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE \n               TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of \n               coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME\n\n               Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence \n               shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are \n               connected to the end of the warehouse.\n\n               INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME\n\n               Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is \n               waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence \n               from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him \n               around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         If you weren't family I'd kill you.\n\n               Clarence is scared.

He's gonna \n                         try to lowball me, Mike.\n\n               Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         You fucking idiot!

It's kind of touching in a \n               twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from \n               striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         God damn it! I still needed to case \n                         that fucking store. It's too risky \n                         to show my face now.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         I got a couple thousand bucks. You \n                         could leave town.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         Leave town?

That's freedom, man. \n                         I could go anywhere I want.\n\n               Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add \n               up in his head.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         Did you kill him, Mike?\n\n               Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers \n               the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper \n               again.\n\n                                     CLARENCE\n                         I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...\n\n               We're talking major fear here...\n\n               Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around \n               again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against \n               his chest.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         It's not your fault you're stupid.\n\n               Tears of relief from Clarence.\n\n               INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n               Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks \n               to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.\n\n               A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, \n               reading a book entitled, \"Strategies and Counter Measures in \n               Hostage Situations\". On the desk in front of him is the bottle \n               with the pen cap still in it.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (to Kimura and Glass)\n                         What do you got on Korda?\n\n                                     KIMURA\n                         We ran a search on relatives.

You're not active on this \n                         case.\n\n               Roper looks at him icily.\n\n                                     SOLIS\n                         It's in everyone's best interest.\n\n               McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. \n               After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis \n               heads back to this office.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (softened)\n                         You guys are doing good work.\n\n               He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him \n               coming.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         I'm sorry about your friend. I had a \n                         friend in SWAT killed. I know how it \n                         can be.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         I appreciate your concern. Let's \n                         leave it at that.\n\n               McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda \n               bottle.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         I don't see much progress here.\n\n               McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot \n               from a nearby \"Mr. Coffee\" machine. It's filled with water. \n               He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.\n\n               CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE\n\n               The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without \n               touching or moving the bottle.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Very nice... You get an \"A\". Notice... \n                         No force required. No damage.\n\n               Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.\n\n                                     SERGEANT\n                         Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 \n                         6th Street.

The wife squeezes her eyes \n               closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... \n               Then...\n\n                                     RAYMOND\n                         I need my coat.\n\n               It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has \n               to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns \n               and goes to get his coat.\n\n               He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. \n               POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. \n               The wife runs out of the room, screaming!\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         NOOOO!!\n\n               He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the \n               carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. \n               He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A \n               couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper \n               bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds \n               down the stairs... down another flight...\n\n               EXT. APT. BLDG.\n\n               McCall comes across the street. Roper sees McCall, cool as \n               ever. Rifle slung over his shoulder. Roper steps into his \n               path.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?\n\n               McCall gives no answer. He pushes past Roper and continues \n               into the building.\n\n               INT. APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               Roper follows, screaming his head off.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Do you think because the police \n                         department issued you a sniper rifle, \n                         it makes you God! What the fuck goes \n                         on in your head?\n\n               McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow \n               \"crime scene\" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops \n               are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under \n               the tape. Roper follows.\n\n               INT. APT. - DAY\n\n               McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes \n               up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. \n               Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun \"Saturday night special\" \n               variety. McCall looks up at Roper.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? \n                         I just saved a life. Yours.\n\n               Roper doesn't miss a beat.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (still angry)\n                         You think I've never had a gun pulled \n                         on me?! You think every fucking time \n                         someone pulls a gun they use it?!\n\n               McCall gets to his feet.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Eighty-five percent of domestic \n                         disturbances of this nature end in \n                         murder/suicide.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (fiercely)\n                         Not the ones I'm at.\n\n               McCall and Roper glare at each other. Toe to toe. A beat. \n               McCall's face softens just perceptibly.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Sorry. My mistake.\n\n               He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, \n               contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses \n               the sheet over Ray's dead body.\n\n               INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT\n\n               Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked \n               \"Internal Affairs\". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the \n               floor. Waiting.\n\n               The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal \n               affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on \n               the back.\n\n                                     INVESTIGATOR\n                         Looks like a clean shoot. Go home \n                         and get some rest.\n\n               McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear \n               back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled \n               off considerably. Even a tad friendly.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Come on. Let's go for a drink.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         I don't really like to drink.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You have to. It's a tradition.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Well, if I have to, I have to.\n\n               INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT\n\n               A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half-\n               finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over \n               the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper \n               studies him.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You got a girlfriend?\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Why?

Sinks his shot. Moves around the table.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You living together?\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         She's back in Jersey... going to \n                         graduate school.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Explain how that works.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         She's going to come here when she \n                         graduates and then we're gonna get \n                         married.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         She grow up in Livingtston, too?\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                              (as if that were \n                              unthinkable)\n                         No, no, no...\n                              (a beat)\n                         She's from Hoboken.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Oh, \"city girl\".

Roper misses his \n               shot. Picks up his beer glass.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Lesson two, \"Dead Eye\"... should \n                         have been lesson one.

Nears the bottom of his glass. \n               Calls to the BARTENDER.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Zack, another round.\n\n               Roper turns back to McCall.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         My partner gave himself in exchange \n                         for a ten year old girl.

Maybe he can.\n\n               INT. ROOM - DAY\n\n               We're looking at a door. It's not clear where we are. McCall \n               enters. We only see his face. Determined.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         I'm Officer McCall, what's going on?\n\n               REVERSE ANGLE\n\n               It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience \n               store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to \n               represent a hostage situation. The \"BAD GUY\" has a walkie-\n               talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out \n               of it.\n\n                                     BAD GUY\n                         What the fuck do you think is going \n                         on, turdhead? I'm about to waste \n                         everyone in this place.\n\n               McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response.

It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting \n               goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a \n               ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands \n               out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The \n               negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman \n               grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his \n               head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.\n\n               Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over \n               at him.

Members of police and SWAT are \n               standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on \n               a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of \n               the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone.

Photos of the hostages are \n               being posted on a bulletin board.

The fire \n                         alarm was probably set off by gunfire. \n                         I believe he's working alone, both \n                         from his conversation and the fact \n                         that he wouldn't come out beyond the \n                         doorway.

JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\n               The jewel thief pulls off his ski mask to reveal he is Korda. \n               His face is sweaty. Hair matted. ANGLE WIDENS to show five \n               very scared hostages: A JEWELER, middle-aged, balding. The \n               male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO \n               SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, \n               gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against \n               the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The \n               guard and one of the jewelers.\n\n               Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler \n               and motions to the dead bodies.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         Drag them behind the counter.\n\n               The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the \n               grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The \n               older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of \n               reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.\n\n               Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't \n               been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, \n               reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open \n               satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones \n               and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to \n               her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She \n               starts walking toward the front door frowning with \n               dissatisfaction.\n\n                                     WOMAN CUSTOMER\n                         I'm not staying here another minute.\n\n                                     SALESGIRL #1\n                              (panicky)\n                         No, Mrs. Dotson.\n\n               Korda rushes around the display case.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         Come here, hag.\n\n               He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags \n               her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a \n               step toward Korda.\n\n                                     MANAGER\n                         Leave her alone!\n\n               Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her \n               unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         You're a brave one, aren't you?\n\n               The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks \n               about making a run at him.\n\n                                     SALESGIRL #2\n                              (pleading)\n                         Sit down, Doug.\n\n               A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with \n               the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old \n               woman.

It whine and smokes... \n               Then disintegrates before our eyes.\n\n               THE CABLE CAR\n\n               Roper feels the lever go slack in his hands. The cable car \n               is speeding toward the end of the line... No way to stop \n               it... Roper turns and takes a running leap into the Caddy...\n\n               INT. CADDY\n\n               He lands in the passenger seat. Roper pounds his foot down \n               on the accelerator. The Caddy lunges ahead of the cable car... \n               McCall can't figure out what he's doing. Roper yanks the \n               steering wheel hard right...\n\n               EXT. STREET\n\n               The Caddy collides with the front of the cable car. Tires \n               SCREAM. The steel wheels CLATTER. A cloud of burning rubber \n               forms. The cable car grinds forward pushing the Cadillac... \n               But it's working. The cable car is slowing.\n\n               BOTTOM OF STREET\n\n               The crowd now sees the Caddy and cable car bearing down on \n               them. General hysteria as they flee.\n\n               THE CABLE CAR\n\n               Korda regains consciousness. Sees what's going on. He grabs \n               the satchel and bails out of the cable car...\n\n               STREET\n\n               ...Onto the hood of a passing taxi. The taxi slams on its \n               brakes. Korda rolls off the hood, picks himself up and runs \n               into an underground garage.\n\n               THE CABLE CAR\n\n               Grinding to a halt just short of the end of the line. Roper \n               grabs McCall's gun off the seat and leaps out of the Caddy \n               to pursue Korda. People approach to ogle the two vehicles in \n               astonishment.\n\n               INT. GARAGE - DAY\n\n               Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in \"ready\" position. \n               He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He \n               glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over \n               the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the \n               garage... Footsteps maybe.\n\n               Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...\n\n               INT. THIRD LEVEL - GARAGE\n\n               Lots of cars, but no one in sight. Roper moves quickly to \n               the protection of a row of cars... He crouches down. Scans \n               beneath the cars... No sign of Korda.\n\n               Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... \n               Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward \n               the window.\n\n               A dog lunges at the CAMERA... Snarling... baring teeth... \n               Roper moves on.\n\n               NEW ANGLE\n\n               As a BMW crawls through the parking structure. Roper steps \n               into the FOREGROUND, right into its path, gun visible. The \n               BMW rolls to a stop. Roper approaches with caution.\n\n               Roper comes up beside the car and sees a very frightened 30 \n               year old blonde. Roper takes a check out of the backseat.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Sorry, go.\n\n               INSIDE THE CAR\n\n               The woman rolls up the window and hits the gas. She drives \n               off.\n\n               INT. GARAGE\n\n               Roper stands in the middle of the garage and takes a final \n               scan... He has the discouraging feeling that Korda might \n               have escaped.\n\n               He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... \n               Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives \n               and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.\n\n               The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the \n               path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make \n               it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear \n               window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail \n               and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.\n\n               GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL\n\n               As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and \n               piles into a parked car.\n\n               Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel \n               of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.\n\n               Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the \n               satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car \n               door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his \n               gun right up between Korda's eyes.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Give me one reason why I shouldn't \n                         kill you right here.\n\n               Korda stares back at Roper defiantly. He knows a cop won't \n               kill him in cold blood...\n\n               What he doesn't know is that Roper doesn't give a shit about \n               those rules at this moment.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You know Sam Baffert was a friend of \n                         mine. He had a wife... and he had a \n                         daughter.\n\n               Korda stares past the barrel of the gun.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         I don't give a shit about you or \n                         your fucking friends.\n\n               And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all \n               inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.\n\n               He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter \n               against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing \n               this guy.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         You can't kill me like this.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         What if you and me got into a \n                         struggle... and my gun went off?\n\n               In a flash, Roper points the gun upward and fires off a SHOT!\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Could I kill you then?\n                              (beat, beat)\n                         Could I kill you then?\n\n               Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the \n               trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. \n               And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. \n               Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst \n               out of his skin.\n\n               ANGLE - MCCALL\n\n               moving across garage into position.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Roper!

Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when \n               we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks \n               Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls \n               his head back and shoves the gun in his face.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         We do this shit by the book, but you \n                         ain't gonna be smiling.\n\n               Korda is doubled up coughing, spitting up blood. Roper walks \n               away as McCall moves in to put the cuffs on Korda.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT\n\n               Roper is sitting in a cubicle doing paperwork. A group of \n               reporters and photographers move down the hallway adjoining \n               the squadroom. One of them is Ronnie. Through the glass walls, \n               she notices Roper sitting alone at the computer.

It spatters on her \n               blouse. She regards the stain with dismay. Puts the lid back \n               on and leaves the kitchen.\n\n               INT.

BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws \n               it open. She looks around. Something's not right. She takes \n               a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A \n               laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the \n               soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a \n               hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...\n\n               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored \n               medicine cabinet.\n\n               IN THE REFLECTION\n\n               Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so \n               slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some \n               perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and \n               closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing \n               right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. \n               She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the \n               floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves \n               closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is \n               in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.\n\n               BRIEF CUT\n\n               A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.\n\n               BACK IN THE HALL\n\n               Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. \n               She reaches down to touch it...\n\n               BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.\n\n               INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the \n               oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the \n               refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The \n               refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around \n               for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, \n               he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce \n               and... Closes the door... Still no one there.\n\n               She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie \n               shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid \n               from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She \n               bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... \n               RIP! She pulls away.\n\n               IN THE HALLWAY\n\n               She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She \n               goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down \n               the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has \n               her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of \n               reach.\n\n               EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps \n               out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway \n               toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. \n               He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.\n\n               Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the \n               wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check \n               himself in the window.\n\n               Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front \n               bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it \n               bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. \n               FLICKERING and FLASHING.\n\n               Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front \n               door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper \n               hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He \n               shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out \n               his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.\n\n               INT. RONNIE'S APT. - NIGHT\n\n               A QUICK SHOT of Clarence's hand grabbing the knife.\n\n               INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Roper kicks open the door. Charges in.\n\n               INT. RONNIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Ronnie is laying on the floor, gasping for air. Choke marks \n               around her throat. Roper rushes to her side. Paco is on his \n               heels.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You okay?!\n\n               She nods.

Roper dashes out the \n               back.\n\n               EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT\n\n               Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back \n               porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire \n               escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape... \n               Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.\n\n               EXT. STREET - NIGHT\n\n               Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... \n               HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty \n               on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the \n               shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the \n               intersection... Into the shadows.\n\n               EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT\n\n               This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He \n               shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. \n               Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep \n               street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots \n               him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence \n               is faltering.\n\n               NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL\n\n               Clarence staggers into an alleyway...\n\n               EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT\n\n               Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the \n               mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes \n               adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the \n               rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.\n\n               He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. \n               Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. \n               Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising \n               into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks \n               another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. \n               Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light \n               of the street... Slowly...\n\n               The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down \n               out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper \n               across the arm.\n\n               Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun \n               CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence \n               has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car \n               and grabs the gun...\n\n               Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence \n               down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the \n               street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights \n               like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him \n               on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.\n\n               WIDER SHOT\n\n               Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. \n               Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the \n               battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns \n               the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of \n               the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. \n               Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! \n               He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body \n               lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of \n               his vehicle.\n\n                                     CABBY\n                         Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!\n\n               Roper walks down the hill to the body. The cabby follows.\n\n                                     CABBY\n                         There was no way I could miss him.\n\n               Roper ignores the cabby. He looks down at Clarence's body, \n               contemplating something.\n\n                                     CABBY\n                         This isn't my fault.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Shut the fuck up!\n\n               The cabby immediately clams up.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Get on your radio and get the police \n                         here.\n\n               Roper stares at Clarence's body, steel-eyed.\n\n               INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Korda is led in again.

He picks up his \n               receiver as Roper picks up his.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         If you try again to hurt me or anyone \n                         I know, I'm going to have you killed.\n\n               Korda feigns total innocence.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         What in the world are you talking \n                         about, Mr. Roper?\n\n               Roper takes out a photograph and holds it up against the \n               glass.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         Here's a picture of your cousin \n                         Clarence. That gentleman standing \n                         over him is the coroner.\n\n               Korda's face tightens. He drops the innocent act. His \n               countenance is now a study in hate.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         I used to have an apartment, a car, \n                         jewelry. I had a fucking eight \n                         thousand dollar watch. Now look what \n                         I have.\n\n               He motions around.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         You're threatening me?

Get some of your guard friends \n                         in here to help. I'd like that.\n\n               Roper glares at him mounting rage.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                              (smirking)\n                         He really shook you up, didn't he?... \n                         I've got ten years worth of appeals \n                         to figure out how to fuck with you. \n                         Who knows? Maybe some scumbag lawyer \n                         will get me out on a technicality.\n\n               Roper sits there, suddenly feeling powerless.\n\n                                     KORDA\n                         You came here to threaten me? That's \n                         a laugh. Maybe you should BEG me... \n                         Go ahead. Get down on your knees.\n\n               Roper leaps from his chair and smashes the receiver against \n               the plexiglass wall.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                         You motherfucker, I swear I'll kill \n                         you!\n\n               The guard rushes over and restrains Roper. Wrestles him away \n               from the glass wall. Roper pushes him off and gathers himself. \n               He gives Korda one last stare. Korda sits there smirking \n               back at him... Roper turns his back and walks out.\n\n               INT.

Fourteen floors up. The two front \n               wheels are literally hanging out there in space.\n\n                                     VET #1\n                              (rambling incoherently)\n                         I can't fight this technology. They \n                         have microprocessors made in totally \n                         sterile environments. I've seen those \n                         places. Everyone is dressed in white. \n                         It's like paper clothing, man. They're \n                         not even human.\n\n               Vet 2 is struggling to stay in the chair and not be tipped \n               into the street 150 feet below. He is, needless to say, very \n               panicky.\n\n                                     VET #2\n                         Dave, don't do this, bro. Pull me \n                         in. We'll do a few laps in the park \n                         and figure out some other way.\n\n               But he's not getting through to his friend.\n\n                                     VET #1\n                         I can't help this, man. Do you have \n                         any idea what those microchips look \n                         like?

A COUPLE OF COPS and MEMBERS OF THE \n               HOSPITAL STAFF peek out at the vet as he continues to rant \n               and rave. McCall arrives at the top of the stairs. OFFICER \n               #4 sure looks happy to see him. McCall takes a peek out onto \n               the roof. He isn't happy about what he sees.\n\n                                     OFFICER #4\n                         When we got here, he was already \n                         doing his balancing act. I was talking \n                         to him, but it made him more agitated \n                         so I backed off.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Why is he up there?\n\n                                     OFFICER #4\n                         Something about a microchip in his \n                         brain.\n\n                                     MCCALL\n                         Who is he?\n\n               A NURSE answers him.\n\n                                     NURSE HERRIN\n                         David Adler.

Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over.

He \n               runs past another building, heading towards the dry dock \n               area and Roper's pickup. A moment later Roper emerges from \n               the machine shop just in time to see Korda round the corner \n               of the next building.\n\n               KORDA\n\n               Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP.

Roper's gun jams. Roper \n               leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he \n               grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper \n               blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.\n\n               KORDA\n\n               Speeds around the buildings and down the alleyways, whipping \n               from side to side, trying to shake Roper off, Roper hanging \n               on for dear life.\n\n                                     ROPER\n                              (shouting)\n                         Give it up, Korda, you got away with \n                         nothing!

He hammers \n               the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the \n               pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through \n               the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with \n               his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the \n               cab...\n\n               ROPER\n\n               In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame \n               of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls \n               over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck \n               along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.\n\n               KORDA\n\n               Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone!

Grabbing a BOARD \n               he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift \n               movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the \n               2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel, \n               past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL, \n               pinning it to the floor.\n\n               As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame, \n               locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING \n               wide open. Korda reacts in panic...\n\n               Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK \n               looming towards them.
