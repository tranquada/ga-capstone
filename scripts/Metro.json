Her eyes are a bit far away.\n\n               Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't \n               been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, \n               reaches in and picks out the jewelry.

Tries to make \n               it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear \n               window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail \n               and continues down to the next level.

He strips the \n               satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car \n               door. Korda goes to his knees.

But he keeps it all \n               inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.\n\n               He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter \n               against Korda's forehead.

A pull of the \n               trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. \n               And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. \n               Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst \n               out of his skin.\n\n<b>               ANGLE - MCCALL\n</b>\n               moving across garage into position.\n\n<b>                                     MCCALL\n</b>                         Roper!

He looks back. \n               Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep \n               street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots \n               him crossing and picks up the pace.

No other sound.\n\n               He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. \n               Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. \n               Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising \n               into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks \n               another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. \n               Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light \n               of the street... Slowly...\n\n               The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down \n               out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife.

He scrambles into the street, around the car \n               and grabs the gun...\n\n               Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence \n               down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the \n               street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights \n               like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him \n               on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.\n\n<b>               WIDER SHOT\n</b>\n               Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill.

Turns \n               the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of \n               the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. \n               Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! \n               He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body \n               lands limply 30 feet down the street.
