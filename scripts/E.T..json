Purple is\ntraditionally the color of that which is sacred.]\n\nEXT: NIGHT SKY: NIGHT\n\nThe black screen becomes a night sky. The camera angles lowers to show a\nforest against the night sky.\n\nEXT: LANDING SITE: NIGHT\n\nIn an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft. The view of the craft is\nobscured by tree branches. The atmosphere is misty, with blue lights coming\nfrom the spacecraft.\n\n[The opening scene is misty and diffused. This forces the audience to pay\nclose attention to the images on the screen. The characters are not clearly\nseen. This engages the audience, as they attempt to see what the aliens\nreally look like.]\n\nOne creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship.\n\nINSERT: ALIEN HAND\n\nA strange hand, with two long and slender fingers protruding, move aside a\nbranch that obstructs the view.\n\n[This concentrates the audience's attention. The creature going into the\nship is being observed by another creature. Who are they? What's going on?\nThis is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action.]\n\nINT: SPACECRAFT'S GREENHOUSE: NIGHT\n\nThe inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse. There are sounds of\nwater dripping. Cone shaped objects (possibly alien plants) sit among earth\nplants. Vapors flow up from the plants.\n\n[These images all appear non-threatening. The aliens are inferred to be\ncollecting vegetation, and are thereby inferred to be harmless.]\n\n[Like many of Spielberg's other films, the opening sequences contain almost\nno dialogue. The story is told without verbal exposition. He forces the\naudience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just\nbits of information that they have to piece together into the story. He\ndoesn't insult their intelligence.]\n\nEXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT\n\nA group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear\na dog howl, and they all stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their\nchests. It appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as\nthe red glow seeps through their translucent skin. After a moment the red\nlights dim and they return to their work.\n\n[This sets up the prop of the red-lights signifying danger. These small\ncreatures are endearing and non-threatening. They are like children, which\nis immediate grounds for audience empathy. The thought that they may be in\ndanger from wild creatures in the forest, also creates empathy for them.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nA small fern grows on the forest floor. An alien hand, with two fingers\nprotruding, reaches out for the fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and\nlistens. The fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then\ncarefully uproots the plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the\ngigantic redwood trees. He's dwarfed by the huge trees.\n\n[The awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for\nthe creature. The audience identifies with him because they too feel small\nwhen confronted by these trees.]\n\nEXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT\n\nThe creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights\nbelow. Suddenly he lets out a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights\nglaring, pulls up next to him.\n\n[The quiet, peaceful alien is now in jeopardy.]\n\nThe creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head- lights\nglaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men's legs are seen\nas they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle as E.T. watches\nfrom behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a\nheadlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands.\n\n[Keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story:\nthe faceless government agent. Like the antagonist of many other fantasy\nfilms, his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences\nattention.]\n\nThe man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map\nthat's placed on the hood of the truck. The man with keys holds the\nflashlight up and points it at the hood. E.T watches them from the bushes.\n\n[The fact that E.T. is observing the actions of the men also creates a\npsychological bond between the audience and him, since they are also\nobserving these characters.]\n\n[While the audience doesn't actually see a map, they presume its existence\ngiven the actions of the characters. This style of story telling engages\nthe audience, and gets them guessing about the characters' actions. They\nthen create expectations, which are later often proved to be wrong. This\nmakes the story both unpredictable and exciting.]\n\nEXT: SPACESHIP: NIGHT\n\nAn alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal,\npresumably to call the other aliens back to the ship.\n\n[These characters are all in jeopardy.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nWhen E.T hears the sound, his red heart lights up. The homing signal\nreverberates in his chest.\n\n[This establishes that his heart is used as a communication device, i.e.,\nthese aliens communicate with their hearts.]\n\n\"Keys\" hears this sound and quickly turns around. He points his flashlight\ntowards the sounds. The other men join him as they walk towards the sound.\nE.T. screams and runs away, which is indicated by the shaking bushes. The\nmen with flashlights chase after him.\n\n[So, like Dorothy in the WIZARD OF OZ, the opening scene has the\nprotagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist.]\n\nEXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT\n\nThe lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft, presumably because the\nspacecraft is preparing to takeoff.\n\n[The protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nE.T. screams as he races for the spacecraft. The glow from his red-heart\nreflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the\nspacecraft.\n\n[The audience still hasn't seen the face of the protagonist.]\n\nEXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT\n\nA lone alien stands before a large round white light, as he signals for the\nother aliens to return to the ship.\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nMen with flashlights run through the forest, as they pursue the red glowing\nlight racing towards the spacecraft. One of the pursuers is the man wearing\nthe keys on his waist.\n\nEXT: SPACECRAFT: NIGHT\n\nThe grated gangplank lifts up, blocking the entrance to the ship. Behind\nthe grate stands the alien against the large round white light. The red\nlight of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier.\n\n[This image exhibits an obstacle to E.T. returning to his ship.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nThe men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the\nspacecraft lift off.\n\nOne red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the\ndeparting spacecraft. Men with flashlights are still in pursuit. They stop\nat a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away.\n\nE.T., with face obstructed by a branch, and with red-heart aglow, watches\nthe spacecraft fly away into the night. He utters a sorrowful moan.\n\n[He has been abandoned in a hostile alien world. This situation is\nguaranteed to generate audience empathy.]\n\nThe men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space- craft\nfly away. They hear E.T.'s groan, and in unison point their flashlights in\nhis direction.\n\n[Not only is the small childlike creature abandoned, but he is still in\njeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him.]\n\n[This is the inciting event in E.T.'s story: his spacecraft has deserted\nhim.]\n\nEXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT\n\nBelow lies the city, lit up against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes\nhis way down the slope.\n\nMen with flashlights follow. They reach the hilltop, search the underbrush\nfor the alien, then start down the slope after him.\n\n[This concludes the prelude to the story. Both the protagonist and\nantagonist have been introduced, and audience empathy has been established\nfor the protagonist. The protagonist's primary objective is to survive and\nfind a way home, while the antagonist's primary objective is to capture the\nalien.]\n\nEXT: SUBURBAN HOUSE: NIGHT\n\n[This is an establishing shot.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nA group of boys are sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS\ngame. One boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of\npaper at each other as they play.\n\nElliott, the youngest boy, sits behind the counter. He's separated from the\nother boys. After a few moments he yells that he's ready to play the game.\n\n[The character's positions are structured to emphasize Elliott's separation\nfrom the others.]\n\nOne of the boys tells Elliott that he can't join when they are in the\nmiddle of the game.\n\n[Audience empathy is generated for the young child who is being excluded\nfrom the game.]\n\nElliott walks up to the table and yells at his brother, Mike. Michael says\nthat Elliott has to ask Steve, who is the Game Master, and who has absolute\npower.\n\n[The notion of \"absolute power\" is set up here, for a \"payoff\" later when\nElliott uses it to keep Michael silent about E.T.]\n\n[Elliott's objective here is to play the game, but also to be accepted by\nthe group and gain the respect of the older boys.]\n\nSteve tells Elliott that first he has to wait for the pizza, then when he\nbrings it back he can play. Steve gives him money for the pizza. Elliott\npicks up his baseball and glove, then leaves the room.\n\n[The ball and glove are props that will be used in the story.]\n\n[Elliott's sub-objective is to get the pizza. Once this is accomplished,\nhe'll be able to play the game.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nIt's a rainy, misty night. Elliott, with ball and glove in hand wait at the\nbottom of the driveway for the pizza. A car pulls up and parks in the\ndriveway. Elliott pays the driver, then takes the pizza box from him as the\ncar pulls out of the driveway.\n\nElliott walks up the driveway and into the garage. He hears a noise in the\nbackyard, then calls out the name \"HARVEY,\" presumably his dogs name.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nElliott's mother wears an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen. She\nbends over to put dishes into the dishwasher. When she does this one of the\nyoung boys reaches out to put his finger on her rear. Mike yells for him to\nstop. He pulls his finger away.\n\nINT: PATIO: NIGHT\n\nElliot walks past the ping pong table when he hears more noises in the\nbackyard. Again he calls out the name \"Harvey.\"\n\n[This generates tension and suspense in the audience.]\n\nWith the pizza box in hand, Elliot walks past the patio table and towards\nthe shed in the backyard. A bright crescent moon hangs in the night sky.\n\n[This adds enchantment to the scene.]\n\nThere is a mist in the air, and a bright light shines in the shed. Elliott\nplaces the pizza box on the ground as he approaches the shed. He's still\ncarrying the baseball and glove as he stands in front of the shed's\nentrance. He tosses the ball into the shed. After a few seconds the ball is\ntossed back out at him and hits him on the foot.\n\n[This is the payoff to the setup of the baseball prop. This event surprises\nboth Elliott and the audience.]\n\nElliott becomes frightened, turns and steps on the pizza box as he runs\ntowards the house.\n\n[This is the inciting event in Elliott's story: there is some creature\nhiding out in his shed that will change his whole life.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nElliott's mother is talking to the boys when Elliott runs into the house\nscreaming that there's something in the tool shed. He tells them that it\nthrew a ball at him, but they continue to ignore him until he screams\n\"QUIET!\" \"Nobody go out there,\" says Elliott. The boys immediately jump up\nfrom the table. Two boys grab kitchen knives as Michael tells his mother to\nstay inside. He and his friends will check it out. She yells at them to put\nthe knives back as she follows them outside.\n\nEXT: SHED: NIGHT\n\nThe light is still on in the shed.\n\nEXT: PATIO: NIGHT\n\nElliott's mother walks into the yard with a flashlight in her hand. She is\nsurrounded by the boys as they approach the shed. The mother says that\nthere's nothing in there as Michael walks through the entrance. Michael\nbends down and finds tracks on the dirt floor. \"The coyote's come back\nagain, Ma.\" he says. His mother becomes frightened and orders them all back\ninto the house.\n\n[Jeopardy is introduced into the situation. Even though the audience knows\nthat it is probably the alien in the shed, the scene increases the\ntension.]\n\nOn his way back to the house, Michael sees the pizza box. He bends down,\nopens the box, then takes out a piece. He's angry at Elliott. Elliott tries\nto explain that it was just an accident, but his brother is still angry.\nWhen the mother asks who ordered the pizza, Elliott points to one of Mike's\nfriends. This makes the friend mad at Elliott. Elliot tries to persuade his\nmother that there is a creature in the shed, but she doesn't believe him.\nThey walk into the house.\n\n[Empathy is generated for Elliott because the two boys are unfairly angry\nat him and his mother doesn't believe him.]\n\nINT: SHED: NIGHT\n\nThe alien's fingers point out into the shed entrance, then wrap around the\nside of the door. The sound of his heavy breathing is heard.\n\n[This establishes for the audience that he really is in the shed. They feel\nsorry for Elliott because he was telling the truth and no one believed\nhim.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: NIGHT\n\nThe clock on the end table indicates 2:00. Next to the clock is a picture\nof a dog, presumably Harvey. This same dog lies asleep in the bed. He hears\na noise and picks up his head. He is in the lower half of a bunk bed. On\nthe top bunk sits Elliott. He is awake as he listens to the noise outside.\n\n[Elliott's objective is to prove there's a creature in the shed.]\n\nEXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT\n\nElliott opens a gate and walks into the backyard. He carries a flashlight\nin his hand and shines it into the cornfield next to his house. He walks\ninto the field.\n\nEXT: CORNFIELD: NIGHT\n\nElliott walks into the cornfield. He whistles, and gets entangled in the\ncornstalks as he walks. He sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball\nnearby. He continues to walk through the field.\n\n[The stalks are obstacles that obstruct both his path and his vision. It\nalso clutters the visuals and forces the audience to pay closer attention.\nThe suspense increases because they aren't sure whether he'll meet up with\nthe alien or the coyote.]\n\nElliott pushes aside some stalks and shines the light into the face of E.T.\nTogether, in unison, the scream. Elliot drops his light, then continues to\nscream as he looks around the field. E.T. cries out and runs away through\nthe cornfield.\n\n[Their reactions upon seeing each other were identical. This is the first\ninstance of a series of situations which will \"merge\" their characters to\nsuch an extent that whatever empathy the audience has for one they will\nalso have for the other.]\n\nEXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT\n\nElliott runs into his backyard. His play swings sway back and forth in the\nair, as if someone had just bumped into them. Two garbage pails fall over\nnear an open metal gate at the top of a stone stairway. The garbage rolls\nout of the cans and down the stone stairs. A red light by the gate lights\nthe stone stairway.\n\n[The audience psychologically associates this red light with E.T.'s red\nlighted heart, and makes the inference that he had run up the staircase and\nout the gate.]\n\nElliott has an expression of wonderment and gratification on his face as he\nlooks up the staircase, for he has just established the existence of the\ncreature in the shed.]\n\nEXT: GARAGE: DAY\n\nElliott rides down the driveway on his bicycle. He next rides down a dirt\nroad that overlooks the suburban community.\n\n[Elliott's new objective is to locate the creature.]\n\nEXT: FOREST ROAD: DAY\n\nElliott holds a bag of candy in one hand as he pours some into the other\nhand. He tosses candy onto the round as he walks through the woods calling\nout for the creature.\n\nIn another part of the woods Elliott lays his bike down, then continues to\ntoss candy and yell out \"hello!\" He sees a man on the road below and\nquickly hides behind a tree.\n\n[\"Keys,\" the faceless antagonist, is still pursuing the alien.]\n\nElliott runs back to his bike, then rides down the forest road past a wire\nfence. The alien's fingers side down the side to the tree. He was watching\nElliott.\n\n[Elliott is in jeopardy both from the faceless man and the faceless alien.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nElliott's mother sits at the tale with the dog, Harvey, at her side.\nElliott, Michael and Gertie are eating supper.\n\n[This is a home without a father, which creates more empathy for the\nprotagonist.]\n\nGertie asks Elliott what he's going as for Halloween. He's depressed, and\nreplies that he's not going. Mike mocks him by suggesting that he go as a\ngoblin. Elliott snaps back, telling Mike to shut up. The mother tries to\nexplain that it's not that they don't believe him, but Elliott cries out\nthat the creature was real.\n\n[The audience also knows that the creature is real. This generates more\nempathy for the protagonist, because he is mocked and not believed when he\nis expressing the truth.]\n\nMike offers other suggestions: perhaps it was an iguana, a deformed child,\nor maybe an Elf or a Leprechaun. Elliott gets angry and shouts \"It was\nnothing like that, penis breath.\" Mary, his mother shouts at him to sit\ndown. Elliott responds with \"Dad would believe me.\" Mary replies \"Maybe you\nought to call your father and tell him about it.\" \"I can't. He's in Mexico\nwith Sally\" says Elliott. Both Mary and Mike are upset, while Gertie asks\n\"Where's Mexico?\" Mary excuses herself and leaves the table. She walks to\nthe window as Mike tells Elliott that he's going to kill him. \"If you ever\nsee it again, don't touch it. Just call me and we'll have someone come and\ntake it away,\" says Mary. \"Like the dog catcher?\" says Gertie. \"But they'll\ngive it a lobotomy, or do experiments on it or something,\" says Elliott.\n\n[This sets up the audience's expectations about the harm that will befall\nthe alien when he is captured.]\n\nAfter a bit of dialogue concerning who should be doing the dishes, Mary\nleaves the room saying \"He hates Mexico.\"\n\n[This scene explores the emotional relationships between the family members\nin greater detail. Empathy is also generated for Mary who was abandoned by\nher husband. She is left with the responsibility of raising the children\nwhile he's traveling with his new girlfriend to Mexico, a country which he\nhates.]\n\nElliott takes some dishes to the sink, turns on the faucet and gazes out\nthe kitchen window as water steams up from the sink.\n\nEXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT\n\nA crescent moon floats in the sky. A bright light is on in the shed. In\nfront of the shed Elliott lies inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair\nwith a flashlight in his hand. He hears the sound of feet walking in the\nunderbrush.\n\nElliott sits up to see the alien standing in front of the shed. The alien\ngroans as Elliott freezes from fear in his chair. He tries to call out for\nhis mother, but can't get the words out of his mouth. He next tries to call\nMike, but fear makes him choke on his words.\n\nThe alien approaches Elliott. The bright light from the shed makes it\nimpossible to see his face: only the outline of his form is visible. The\nalien walks right up to the edge of the lawn chair.\n\n[The scene is filled with suspense because Elliott may be in jeopardy from\nthe creature.]\n\nThe alien slowly moves its hand over the chair, then drops candies onto the\nblanket. Elliott relaxes.\n\n[This non-verbal gesture by E.T. demonstrates that he is harmless. The\ntension in the scene is thereby released. Elliott has achieved his\nobjective: he established contact with the alien.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nElliott places candy on the carpet, then walks backwards down the hallway\ntowards his room. E.T. walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy,\nwhich he then takes into his hand and eats.\n\n[Elliott's new objective is to get the alien into his room. His main\nobstacles are to somehow persuade the alien to come into the house, while\nnot waking his family.]\n\n[This scene also is a good example of how to structure a scene's beginning.\nIn real life, the scene would have started in the backyard, tracked through\nthe kitchen, the living room and then up the stairs. But since all of that\ninformation would have been redundant, picking the action up from the top\nof the stairs was sufficient.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT\n\nElliott places candy on the floor by the entrance to his room. A sign on\nhis door contains the word \"ENTER.\" E.T picks up the candy.\n\nElliott has run out of candy. He goes to his desk in search for more. He\nopens some drawers, but doesn't find any. When he returns to the doorway,\nE.T. has already entered the room. E.T. pulls a box down from the table,\nthen knocks a can filled with pens onto the floor. This makes a loud noise,\nand forces Elliott to quickly close the door to his room.\n\n[The audience still does not have a clear view of E.T.'s face nor body.\nThis holds their attention during the scene. They are waiting for that\nwonderful moment.]\n\nElliott throws a blanket over E.T. as they stare at each other. E.T. is\nfinally revealed to the audience.\n\nElliott moves his hand in front of his face, a gesture indicating\nbewilderment. E.T. mimics this action.\n\n[This is the beginning of their efforts to communicate, but also the start\nof the audience emotionally identifying the two characters as one object of\nempathy.]\n\nElliott places his fingers to his lips to see if E.T. will respond in the\nsame manner, which he does. Elliott then places one finger to his ear,\nwhich E.T. also mimics. Elliott smiles, then holds his left hand up with\nall five fingers spread apart. E.T. raises his left hand with three fingers\nspread apart. Elliott closes his fingers until there is only one remaining\nup. E.T. does the same. They both wiggle this one finger. A poster on the\nwall between Elliott and E.T. has the word \"SUPERSTAR\" printed on it.\n\n[These actions help the audience to conceive of these two characters as\n\"mirror images\" of one another, worthy of equal empathy. It also bonds the\nyoung children in the audience to them, because the characters are speaking\nin a language they too can understand. All the children in the audience\nhave just been through the experience of learning a language. They can\neasily identify with the problems that that two characters in the story are\nhaving in communicating with each other. This forges a bond between the\nchildren and both Elliott and E.T. This also forms the basis for the repeat\nviewing of this film which was essential for its phenomenal box-office\nsuccess.]\n\nSuddenly, Elliott becomes tired and yawns, then sways as if in a trance. He\nslowly walks backwards and sits down in a chair. Elliott seems asleep as\nthe camera moves up for a closeup of Elliott's face.\n\n[Presumably, E.T. has used his telepathic powers to place Elliott into a\ntrance in order to merge their minds and feelings.]\n\n[This is the end of the first act. Elliott has succeeded in gaining\npossession of the dramatic objective E.T.), and has him in his room. But\nE.T. has also taken possession of Elliott by merging their feelings, so\nthat they both become one protagonist. The second act will end when they\nare both captured by the antagonist.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: DAY\n\nMist envelops the fence and gate in the section of the forest where E.T\noriginally landed. Men with flashlights and floodlights search throughout\nthe area. \"Keys\" walks into the forefront, holding a flashlight in his\nhand. He bends to the ground and finds some candy.\n\n[The objective of the faceless antagonist is to capture the alien. The\ncandy is a prop that will lead them to Elliott's house just as Elliott used\nthem to lead E.T. into his room. This scene shows that the protagonist is\nin jeopardy, because he is still being pursued.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nElliott lies in bed with a thermometer in his mouth. His head rests on an\norange pillow (same color as his mother's dress in the first scene) while\nhis mother sits besides him. She takes out the thermometer, reads it, then\nsays \"Okay, you're hot.\" She then leaves the room. Elliott quickly swings a\nlamp back over his head and heats the thermometer. He also places a blue\nheating pad over his face, to heat himself. He then places the thermometer\nback into his mouth, swings the lamp away, and places the heating pad under\nthe covers as his mother enters the room. She opens his closet and\nseparates the hanging clothes as she walks into the closet. Elliott sits up\nin bed and intensely watches her.\n\n[Elliott's objective is to stay home from school in order to be with E.T.\nHis obstacle is his mother, who wants him to go to school. To overcome this\nobstacle he must persuade her that he's sick. A crisis occurs when she\nenters the closet in which E.T. is hiding. This creates jeopardy for the\nprotagonist.]\n\nEXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY\n\nMike backs the car down the driveway.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nMary walks out of the closet carrying a blue sleeping bag. Elliott is\ntense, then relieved, once he realizes that she didn't find E.T. He falls\nback into bed.\n\nINTERCUT: DRIVEWAY\n\nMike backs the car over part of the lawn.\n\n[This scene functions not only as comic relief, but also as a set up for\nthe scene here Mike has to drive the van during E.T.'s escape sequence.\nThis demonstrates both his incompetence, and that he is only allowed to\ndrive the car backwards down the driveway.]\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nMary covers Elliott with the blue sleeping bag as Elliott puts the\nthermometer back into his mouth (first backwards, then he corrects it).\n\n[Humor is generated because the audience knows that he is fooling his\nmother.]\n\nINTERCUT: DRIVEWAY\n\nMike continues to back the car down the driveway. He overshoots the edge\nand goes out into the street. He then pulls forward across the sidewalk.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\n\"You were outside waiting for that thing?\" says Mary. Elliott nods.\n\n[Elliott is covered in blue-white colors, which traditionally signify\ninnocence, and which generates audience empathy for him.]\n\nShe tells him not to watch TV, kisses him, then leaves the room. Elliott\nquickly closes the blinds.\n\nEXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY\n\nMary runs down the driveway towards the car. Gertie points out the patches\nof lawn that Mike pulled onto the driveway as he was driving the car. Mary\npulls her into the car.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nElliott gestures for E.T. to walk out of the closet, which he does. He is\nwearing Elliott's robe. Elliott asks him if he talks.\n\n[Elliott's objective is to communicate with E.T., his obstacle is that E.T.\ndoes not speak the English language.]\n\n\"Me Human. Boy. Elliott, Elliott, Elliott\" says Elliott.\n\nE.T. turns away and walks towards the work table. Elliott picks up objects,\nsuch as a can of coke and toy soldiers, from the table then names them for\nE.T. Elliott points to the fish and explains how the fish eat the fish\nfood. He places a wooden toy shark into the fishbowl, then states that the\nshark eats the fish but nobody eats the shark.\n\n[In his effort to communicate with E.T., Elliott tries to teach him the\nlanguage by showing him objects that are used in everyday life. This\nprocess is similar to that experienced by the children and parents in the\naudience everyday as they also learn and attempt to communicate with each\nother. This type of scene solidifies the audience's emotional bonding with\nElliott and E.T.]\n\nE.T. takes a toy car into his mouth on chews on it.\n\n[Like many a child would.]\n\nElliott takes this to mean that E.T. is hungry. Elliott tells E.T. to stay\nwhere he is.\n\n[Elliott's new objective is to get food for E.T. and himself.]\n\nElliott opens the door and Harvey tries to run into the room. E.T. groans\nwith fear and backs into a corner as Elliott pulls Harvey out of the room.\n\n[This introduces jeopardy into the scene, for Harvey could harm E.T.]\n\nINT: KITCHEN: DAY\n\nElliott, dressed only in white underwear, opens the refrigerator door and\ntakes out some food.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nE.T. walks around the room.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nElliott opens up a jar of peanut butter.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nE.T. touches a tennis racket.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nElliott picks up cheese and tomatoes.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nE.T. picks up an umbrella.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nElliott takes a carton of milk out of the refrigerator.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nE.T. accidentally opens up the umbrella.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nElliott screams with fright and drops the milk carton onto the floor.\n\nINTERCUT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM\n\nE.T. screams with fright, drops the umbrella, then runs into the closet.\n\n[This further establishes the merging of E.T. and Elliott into one being.\nElliott shares E.T.'s feelings and simultaneously experiences what he\nexperiences. The audience also experiences this surprise with them, which\nfurther tightens the bonds.]\n\nMilk flows from the open carton onto the floor, as Elliott leans into the\nopen refrigerator. He clutches his chest and looks up towards the ceiling\nas he ponders his experience.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nElliott carries a plate of food into the room. He walks past the open\numbrella and looks into the closet. Stuffed animals line the back of the\ncloset wall. E.T. pushes the animals forward. He was hiding behind them. He\nis still shaking from the fright experience. \"Are you okay? Too much\nexcitement, huh? You want a coke?\"\n\n[This is the resolution of the last scene sequence. We see both characters'\nreactions to the events that have occurred.]\n\nEXT: DRIVEWAY: DAY\n\nMichael runs up the driveway towards his house. He's wearing a red football\nblazer.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMichael opens the front door and runs into the house. He takes off his red\nshirt to reveal the blue shirt he's wearing underneath. He picks up a\nmagazine then opens the refrigerator. \"Nothing but health shit,\" he says,\nas he takes out a can and shakes it.\n\n[The audience tenses up because jeopardy has just been introduced into the\nstory. They wonder what will happen when Mike discovers E.T. in Elliott's\nbedroom.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nElliott walks away from his closet and opens the door to his room. He tells\nMike to come in. Both boys are dressed in blue and white colors. Mike calls\nElliott a faker, then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game,\nwhen Elliott interrupts, to tell him about the goblin. Michael makes fun of\nElliott and his belief that the goblin has returned. But Elliott persists,\nand makes Mike promise to give Elliott \"absolute power.\"\n\n[This is the payoff to the \"absolute power\" concept as set up during the\nDUNGEON AND DRAGONS scene.]\n\n[Elliott's objective is to vindicate himself to his brother and sister by\nproving that \"the Goblin-E.T.\" really does exist.]\n\nEllott makes Mike close his eyes, then he retrieves E.T. from the closet\nand leads him to the center of the room. Mike has a silly grin on his face\nas he opens his eyes and turns around to look at E.T. A sickening look of\nterror comes over his face.\n\nSuddenly Gertie opens the door and walks into the room with her doll under\nher arm, saying \"Elliott, look what I made for you.\" E.T. sees her then\nstretches his neck to raise his head high. Gertie walks right up to him and\nscreams. E.T. screams back at her. Elliott screams for both of them to\nstop. Mike falls back against the wall and knocks down the bookcase. They\nall scream together. Elliott grabs Gertie's mouth and pushes her back to\nMike.\n\n\"Kids, I'm home,\" shouts Mary from downstairs.\n\n[Jeopardy! The mother, an adult, is about to discover E.T. Even though they\nare terrified, the children all band together against the threat. They'd\nrather sit in the closet with the \"monster\" than have their mother discover\nhim.]\n\nMike quickly shuts the door, then they all run to the closet. Gertie\nscreams again. Mike grabs her by the mouth and pulls her away as E.T. runs\nacross the room with his arms raised. Elliott shuts the closet door just as\nhis mother walks into his room. Mary notices the fallen bookcase. She looks\naround and then comments, \"This is no room, this is an accident.\" Elliot\ntries to cover by saying he was \"reorganizing.\"\n\nINT: CLOSET: DAY\n\nE.T.'s head appears among the stuffed animals. Mike has his hand over\nGertie's mouth as she tries to scream. Mary walks past the closet door.\n\n[This creates suspense in the audience: will E.T. be discovered by Mary?]\n\nMary asks Elliot to keep an eye on Gertie while she takes a shower. She\nkisses him on the head then leaves the room. Elliott opens the closet door.\nMichael, in awe with mouth open wide, watches as Elliott approaches E.T.\n\n\"Elliott,\" whispers Mike. \"I'm keeping him,\" says Elliott.\n\nE.T. sits behind the stuffed animals as if he was one of them.\n\n[The use of stuffed animals as props around E.T helps to transfer positive\nfeelings that the audience has for them to E.T.]\n\nGertie asks what it is as she and Michael approach E.T. Elliott tells her\nthat it won't hurt her. When asked if it's a boy or girl, Elliott replies\nthat it's a boy. He then tells her that she can't tell Mom about the\ncreature. When asked why not, he explains that \"grownups can't see him.\nOnly little kids can see him.\" Gertie snaps back, \"Give me a break.\"\n\n[The charm in Gertie's character lies in the contradictory attributes of\nbeing a sophisticated child. Humor is generated by this incongruity.]\n\nElliott then goes into his Dracula voice: \"Then do you know what will\nhappen if you do tell?\" He grabs Gertie's doll, tosses it to Mike and tells\nhim to \"Do it!.\" Mike \"tortures\" the doll by twisting its arm. Gertie cries\nas she runs to it. E.T. watches the scene with wonderment in his eyes.\nGertie finally promises not to tell about E.T. They all watch him as he\nstretches his neck and lifts up his head.\n\nEXT: COMMUNITY: DAY\n\nOn the hilltop overlooking the neighborhood stands a man with a camera as\nhe takes photos of the houses below. The man with keys on his waist walks\ninto the area, as other men comb the ground with electronic equipment.\n\n[Jeopardy is introduced in the scene in order to maintain tension in the\naudience. The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\n[This is an establishing shot.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT`S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nMary, carrying a yellow watering pail, walks across the room and waters a\nlarge plant. Gertie pulls a little red wagon into the hallway. When asked\nby Mary what she's doing, Gertie replies that she's going to play in\nElliott's room. \"Okay, don't let them torture you,\" says the mother. \"I\nwon't, Mary,\" replies Gertie.\n\n[This generates humor because the child deals with the mother as if they\nare equals.]\n\nGertie picks up a pot containing a sickly geranium plant and places it into\nthe wagon. The phone rings and Mary answers it off screen.\n\n[The plant becomes an important prop because in the story it will represent\nthe health and well-being of E.T.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT\n\nGertie knocks on the door. Mike lets her and Harvey into the room. They\nwalk to the table where E.T. and Elliott are sitting. Gertie puts the\nsickly plant n the table. E.T. puts his finger into the plant. Elliott\nopens up an encyclopedia and points to California on a map of the United\nStates. \"We are here,\" Elliott says as E.T. munches on celery. Michael\nhands Elliott a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map. Elliott\npoints to the globe, then asks E.T. where he's from. E.T. points out the\nwindow.\n\n[Elliott's objective is to discover more about the alien.]\n\nElliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy. He points to\nthe planet earth, touches the globe, then says \"HOME, HOME.\" E.T. makes a\nsoft noise that sounds similar to the word \"home.\" Gertie watches him as he\npicks up round objects and places them on the map: three small pieces of\nfruit and two eggs. E.T.'s eyes concentrate on the table, which then starts\nto shake. The two eggs and three small pieces of fruit then lift off the\ntable and float in the air. The children watch with awe.\n\n[This introduction of \"magical\" powers that E.T. possesses was unexpected\nand thereby helps to make the story unpredictable.]\n\nElliott screams with fright and the floating objects drop to the floor. He\nwalks to a lamp and stares into it. Mike asks what is wrong. \"I don't know.\nSomething scary,\" says Elliott as E.T. places his finger on Elliott's\nshoulder.\n\n[Jeopardy is introduced into the scene with this comment. Yet it is not\nE.T. who is to be feared, as indicated by his comforting gesture of placing\nhis finger on Elliott's shoulder.]\n\nEXT: BACKYARD: NIGHT\n\nElliott runs by the shed, past a swaying swing, up the stairs to the red\nlamppost and to the wire gate. He strains to hear the sounds of men\ntalking.\n\n[The antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: NIGHT\n\nE.T. sits next to a lamp as he reads a child's ABC book. He sits next to a\nRaggedy Ann doll.]\n\n[Another image of E.T. learning the language which helps to forge a bond\nbetween him and children in the audience. Good feelings for the doll are\nalso transferred to the alien.]\n\nOn the floor next to E.T. is the pot containing the sickly flowers. He\nlooks at the flowers, makes a moaning sound, and suddenly they become\nhealthy and transform into full bloom.\n\n[This establishes the magical healing powers of E.T.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nElliott and Mike walk down the driveway. They are on their way to school.\nThey discuss E.T., arguing about how smart he is.\n\n[This is just a transition scene.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nMike and Elliot walk towards a bus stop where a group of children are\nwaiting. Mike's friends torment Elliott about his \"goblin.\"\n\n[This generates more audience empathy for Elliott, who is unfairly mocked\nby the ignorant boys. Elliott still has not earned the respect of Mike's\nfriends, which is one of his dreams.]\n\nThey finally get on the bus as Elliott walks away, followed by a pretty\nblonde girl who seems to have a crush on him. Michael appears worried as he\nsits on the bus among the other children who are throw- ing objects at each\nother.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nGertie stands on the stairway looking up, presumably thinking about E.T. in\nElliott's room. Mary comes running downstairs and tells Gertie that they\nhave to get into the car, otherwise they'll be late. Suddenly, Mary hears a\nnoise upstairs. She goes up to see what caused the sound.\n\n[Jeopardy: E.T. is in danger of being discovered by an adult. The\naudience's expectations were shaped in the earlier dinner scene, where Mary\ntold the children she would call to have the creature taken away if he came\naround the house again. This is what the audience expects her to do if she\nfinds E.T.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S BEDROOM: DAY\n\nMary walks into the closet and looks around. The camera pans across the\nlarge faces of all the stuffed dolls: Raggedy Ann, a Bear, a Monkey, E.T.'s\nFace, a Lion, etc. Mary doesn't notice E.T., then closes the closet door\nand leaves.\n\n[Humor is generated because of the incongruity of a living creature among\nthe dolls, and the inability of Mary to distinguish between them. The\nlaughter releases the tension that was created in the previous scene. This\nalso reinforces the audience's emotional ties to E.T., since he is so\n\"doll-like.\"]\n\nINT: SCHOOL: DAY\n\nA teacher walks down the aisle and announces to the class that today they\nwill perform the frog dissection for which they have been preparing. As he\npasses Elliott's desk, he starts to say \"frogs similar to,\" then he notices\nthe drawing of E.T. The teacher picks it up. Elliott turns to see the\npretty blonde girl staring at him. Realizing she's been caught, she quickly\nturns and looks away.\n\n[This attraction to Elliott is set up in order to payoff before the end of\nthe school sequence.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nE.T. opens the door to Elliott's room and walks out into the hallway.\nHarvey sees and quickly approaches.\n\n[Jeopardy: will the dog attack E.T.? At there last encounter E.T. was\nfrightened by Harvey.]\n\nINTERCUT: CLASSROOM\n\nThe teacher continues his instructions, telling the students that the\nscalpel is very sharp, and that they should use discretion when cutting.\nThere should be very little blood, and maybe a little body fluids.\n\n[This exposition of the plans sets up the audience's expectations, which\nlater will not be fulfilled. This is a standard structure used to generated\nexcitement and unpredictability in a story.]\n\nINT: KITCHEN: DAY\n\nE.T., wearing a blue-flannel shirt, walks into the kitchen with Harvey at\nhis side. He opens the refrigerator. Harvey licks his lips as he watches in\nanticipation of getting something to eat. E.T. takes out a plastic\ncontainer of potato salad, opens it, then sticks his tongue into the salad.\nHe hates the taste and throws it onto the floor. Harvey licks it up. E.T.\nthen picks up a can of beer and drinks it as Harvey barks.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott sits at his desk as he listens to the teacher speak. Elliott burps.\nAll the children in the classroom stare at him.\n\n[This again shows the merging of Elliott and E.T.]\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nE.T., drunk, wobbles across the kitchen floor and walks into a counter.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott places his fingers to his head. He is also becoming drunk. The\nteacher tells the class that in this bisection they should locate the heart\nand notice that it is still beating.\n\n[The red-lit heart is the most prominent feature of E.T. Having the teacher\nfocus on the frog's heart starts the identification in the audience's mind\nof the frogs and E.T.]\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nE.T. turns and walks into another wall as Harvey continues to eat the\npotato salad on the floor.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott, now drunk, slides down in his chair.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nE.T. turns, walks, then collapses head first onto the floor.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott slides under his desk and falls onto the floor. The teacher doesn't\nhear this because at that moment he pulls down a wall hanging which\ncontains pictures of a frog's anatomy.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nE.T. opens another can of beer.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott pulls himself up off the floor with a drunken smile on his face.\n\nINTERCUT: KITCHEN\n\nE.T. gulps down another can of beer.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott, drunk, sits at his desk. He turns and smiles at the pretty blonde\ngirl across the aisle. She turns away from him with disgust.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVING ROOM\n\nE.T. plays on the keys of a voice generating language game. He next presses\na button on a remote control which activates the TV set. A cartoon appears\nwith a cat getting its tail caught on fire. The cat screams and E.T reacts\nwith horror. He throws the beer can at the TV set.\n\n[Laughter is generated, for while this under normal circumstances would be\ninappropriate behavior, he makes sense given E.T.'s point of view.]\n\nHe then presses another button on the remote, and the image of a flying\nplane appears on the screen. A spaceship next appears, and pulls the plane\nup towards it.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nThe teacher carries a jar of cotton balls soaked in chloroform, which he\ndrops into the jars containing frogs. He tells the children to immediately\nput the lids on the jars. After telling the children that this won't hurt\nthe frogs, he places a cotton ball into the last two jars, one of which\nbelongs to Elliott. Elliott doesn't place the cover on his jar, but instead\nsadly watches as the frog tries to escape. Slowly he places to lid on it,\nas he gazes at the frog.\n\n\"Say hi. Can you talk? Can you talk? Can you say hi?\" says Elliott.\n\n[Elliott is making an emotional identification of the frog with E.T. by\nattempting the same process of communication. The situation also creates\nexpectations in the audience that similar things will happen to E.T. once\nhe is captured.]\n\nCLOSEUP: FROG'S FACE\n\nCLOSEUP: E.T.'S FACE\n\n[A cinematic technique which reinforces the identification of the frog with\nE.T. This sets up the audience for E.T.'s operation. They expect the frog\nto die, and they project these expectations to E.T. later in the story.]\n\nINTERCUT: LIVING ROOM\n\nE.T. has a hangover as he hiccups and puts his hand on his head. He then\npicks up the cartoon section of a newspaper. One cartoon strip has a\npicture of a communication device with a caption stating \"HELP, HELP.\"\n\nOn the TV monitor a woman is talking long distance n her telephone to her\nUncle Ralph in California. E.T. hears the sounds coming from the TV, then\nturns to look at the monitor, where he sees a man talking into a phone in\nhis hand. The camera pans to a phone near E.T. A child in the TV program\npicks up the phone, says hello to his uncle, then hangs up.\n\n[This generates laughter because it's inappropriate behavior to just say\nhello, then hang up.]\n\nE.T. looks closer at the Buck Rogers cartoon. One cell has an image of a\nman in a spacesuit setting up a transmitter. The next cell has him saying\n\"It works\" as the communication device transmits \"help, help!\" E.T. lifts\nup his head from the newspaper.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\n\"Save him\" shouts Elliott. Elliott picks up his jar, unscrews the top, then\nlets out his frog, screaming \"Run for your life. Back to the forest! Run!\"\n\n[Another merging of E.T. and Elliott's feelings and thoughts. E.T.\npresumably had the feeling of wanting to be saved by his friends, and this\nfeeling prompted Elliott to cry out.]\n\nHe next opens the jar of the girl besides him. Elliott struggles with one\nstudent, then proceeds to turn over many of the other jars as he frees the\nfrogs. Some of the other children also free their frogs.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nE.T. studies the electronic circuitry of the language game. Suddenly John\nWayne comes on the screen. E.T. is fascinated with his image. It's a scene\nfrom the movie \"QUIET MAN.\" Maureen O'Sullivan huddles in a corner of the\nroom.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nA pile of frogs gather at the feet of a terrified little girl with blonde\nbraids. Elliott, drunk, staggers by her.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nE.T. continues to watch the TV monitor as the woman in the movie screams.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nA blonde girl who has a crush on Elliott screams when a frog is placed on\nher shoes.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nThe woman in the movie runs out the door. John Wayne grabs hold of her arm.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott grabs hold of the blonde girl as she runs out the door.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nJohn Wayne pulls the woman back.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott pulls the blonde girl back.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nJohn Wayne takes the woman into his arms.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott takes the blonde girl into his arms.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nJohn Wayne kisses the woman.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nElliott, too short to kiss her, stands on the back of a student who was\ncrawling on the floor after a frog. Elliott kisses the girl.\n\nINTERCUT: LIVINGROOM\n\nE.T., filled with fascination, watches the TV monitor.\n\nINTERCUT: SCHOOL\n\nThe children's hands poke through the windows and free the frogs by\nthrowing them out onto the grass.\n\n[Elliott was able to accomplish his objective of freeing the frogs. This\nsequence was structured to run in parallel in order to emphasize the\nmerging of Elliott and E.T.]\n\nINT: LIVING ROOM: DAY\n\nA blanket containing aluminum foil, electrical toys and appliances is\npulled across the floor.Mary opens the door and yells hello. Harvey runs to\nthe front door. E.T walks out from behind the TV and kicks beer cans across\nthe floor.\n\n[The alien quickly learns the appropriate behavior for drinking at home.]\n\nMary, with her arms filled with grocery bags and clothes from the cleaners,\nwalks into the kitchen. She is followed by Gertie, who sees E.T standing\nnear the refrigerator. Mary opens the refrigerator door, and knocks E.T. in\nthe head. He falls backwards onto the floor. Gertie helps E.T. up off the\nfloor. He walks past Mary as he goes back to the refrigerator. Mary still\ndoesn't see him.\n\n[This increases the audience's tension. They are expecting E.T. to be\ndiscovered by Mary, and they are expecting her to scream.]\n\nGertie keeps telling her that she wants Mary to meet somebody, but Mary\nignores her as she talks about how much the price of food has gone up in\none week. E.T. grabs a can of coffee from the kitchen table, then again\nwalks past Mary as she goes in the opposite direction. He goes back into\nthe TV room.\n\n[The laughter's produced by Mary's failure to see the reality of the alien\nwho's right under her nose.]\n\nGertie is watching a language teaching program for children on the TV. The\nprogram is teaching words that begin with the letter \"B\". The phone rings\nas Mary accidentally kicks a can of beer across the floor. She answers the\nphone with the beer can in her hand. The person on the phone tells Mary\nthat Elliott is intoxicated.\n\nGertie, watching the TV monitor, responds to the program by practicing the\n\"B\" words. E.T. pokes his head up from behind the monitor and says\n\"BBBBBBB.\" Gertie stares at him as he repeats the \"B\" sound, then lowers\nhis head back down below the TV.\n\n\"You said 'B',\" says Gertie. \"B,\" repeats E.T. \"You said 'B,' good,\" says\nGertie. \"B...GOOD,\" repeats E.T.\n\n[This is a set up for the closing communication between E.T. and Gertie\nbefore he flies away in the spacecraft. This is also the first moment that\nhe spoke an English word. Many children and parents in the audience can\nidentify with this moment, and the first moral precept usually taught to a\nchild: be good.]\n\nMary hangs up the phone and tells Gertie that she has to pick up Elliott.\nShe asks Gertie to be a good girl. \"Mommy, he can talk,\" says Gertie. \"Of\ncourse he can talk,\" says Mary, referring to the TV program.\n\n[The humor is generated from Mary's misunderstanding of Gertie's\nstatement.]\n\nAs Mary leaves, E.T. walks out from behind the TV. He walks to a phone and\nstares. \"Phone,\" says Mary. \"Phone,\" says E.T. E.T. presses the numbers of\nthe phone. \"You want to call somebody?\" asks Gertie.\n\n[This establishes E.T.'s objective: to communicate with his fellow\ncreatures so that he can return home.]\n\nINT: HOUSE: DAY\n\nElliott walks up the stairs to his room. Mary's voice can be heard from\nbelow saying she refuses to pay for frogs.\n\n[This is a fine example of the point of attack for a scene: Instead of\nshowing what would happen in real life (Mary's discussions with the teacher\nabout Elliott's behavior in the classroom), the scene picks up with what is\nimportant for the audience: Elliott's discovery that E.T. can now talk. A\nscene showing Mary in school would be redundant and dramatically\nirrelevant.]\n\nElliott is walking towards his room when he hears Gertie talking to E.T. in\nher room. He drops his bags on the floor, and quickly enters her room.\n\n\"Be good, be good,\" says Gertie as she closes the doors to her closet.\nElliott pushes Gertie away from the closet and opens it. Inside is E.T.\ndressed up in girl clothes with a blonde wig on his head. He has a rabbit\nfur around his neck and wears a black hat with flowers.\n\n[This is completely inappropriate attire for an alien, whether male or\nfemale. The visual incongruity of E.T. in girl's clothes generates the\nlaughter.]\n\n\"Oh God!\" says Elliott. \"Elliott,\" says E.T. \"What?\" says Elliott, not yet\nrealizing that it was E.T. who spoke. \"Elliott, Elliott,\" repeats E.T. \"I\ntaught him how to talk. He can talk now,\" says Gertie.\n\n[Elliott, with the help of Gertie and the TV program, has completed one of\nElliott's objectives: communicating with E.T.]\n\nGertie points out the things that E.T. has brought upstairs: electrical\ntoys and the plant. She wonders what he needs this for. E.T. holds the\ncartoon page of the newspaper out to Elliott. \"E.T., can you say that? Can\nyou say E.T.?\" asks Elliott. \"E.T.,\" repeats E.T. Elliott laughs with joy.\nE.T keeps repeating his name as he turns and walks through the closet into\nElliott's room.\n\n\"E.T., be good,\" says E.T. \"Be good,\" I taught him that too,\" says Gertie.\n\n[\"Be good\" is a fundamental value taught children, as basic as the\nprinciple \"There's no place like home,\" taught in the WIZARD OF OZ.]\n\n\"You should give him his dignity. This is the most ridiculous thing I've\never seen,\" says Elliott.\n\nE.T. hands Elliott the newspaper, and points to the Buck Rodgers comic\nstrip. He then says \"PHONE\". Elliott is amazed at this. E.T. walks into the\ncloset and says \"HOME.\" Elliott confirms that this is E.T.'s home. E.T.\nthen turns, walks to the window, points to the sky, and says \"E.T. HOME\nPHONE.\"\n\n\"E.T. PHONE HOME\" says Gertie. \"E.T. PHONE HOME\" says Elliott.\n\n\"He wants to call somebody,\" says Gertie.\n\n[This reconfirms E.T.'s objective.]\n\nMike walks into the room and laughs at E.T.'s attire.\n\n\"E.T. Phone Home,\" says E.T.\n\n\"Oh my God, he's talking now,\" says Mike.\n\nE.T. once again points out the window and repeats that he wants to call\nhome.\n\"And they'll come?, says Elliott.\n\"Come?\" responds E.T. \"Home, home\" he repeats.\n\nEXT: STREET: NIGHT\n\nA truck drives down the street. Inside a man with earphones listens to the\nconversations in the neighborhood homes, as he fine tunes his electronic\neavesdropping equipment. He focuses in on Elliott's voice.\n\n[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are getting closer and closer. They\nare now inside the privacy of the protagonist's home, listening to their\nmost intimate conversations.]\n\nINT: GARAGE: NIGHT\n\nElliott, Mike and Harvey are in the garage searching for objects that E.T.\ncould use in building his communications device. Elliott restates that he\nhas \"absolute power\" and that E.T. belongs to him.\n\n[Elliott's objective is to possess E.T., not set him free. Freeing the one\nhe loves is the lesson he will have to learn in this story.]\n\nEXT: STREET: NIGHT\n\nThe van containing electronic eavesdropping equipment drives past Elliott's\nhouse.\n\n[They are still in jeopardy: their actions and words are being monitored.]\n\nINT: GARAGE: DAY\n\nMike tells Elliott that E.T. doesn't look too good anymore.\n\"Don't say that, we're fine!\" says Elliott.\n\"What's all this we stuff. You say we all the time now. Look Elliott,\nI think he might be getting sick,\" replies Michael.\n\n[This confirms Elliott's belief that he considers himself and E.T. to be\none being. It also introduces further jeopardy for E.T. Besides being\ntracked by the antagonist, he is also becoming sick.]\n\nINT: VAN: NIGHT\n\nThe man with the earphones is listening to Elliott and Michael's\nconversation as they discuss E.T.'s sickness.\n\nINT: GARAGE: DAY\n\nMike tells Elliott to grab the fuzzbuster. Elliott pulls his father's blue\nshirt out from the shelf. They reminisce about the days when he used to\ntake them to baseball games and the movies, where they would have baseball\nfights. Mike says that they'll do that again, but Elliott doesn't really\nbelieve him. They each smell their father's shirt.\n\"Old Spice,\" says Mike.\n\"Sea Breeze,\" says Elliott.\n\n[Here a prop (their father's shirt) is used to reveal the emotional\nrelationships between the two boys and their father. Audience empathy is\ngenerated for them because they have been abandoned by their father. The\naudience's anger is transferred from the father to the antagonist who is\neavesdropping on this private intimate moment.]\n\nINT: VAN: NIGHT\n\nThe man in the van continues to listen to Elliott and Michael's\nconversation. Only the listener's eye is clearly visible.\n\n[This is a cinematic technique to signify the \"ever-watching eye\" of the\nfaceless antagonist.]\n\nINT: GERTIE'S ROOM: NIGHT\n\nMary lies in bed next to Gertie as she reads her the Peter Pan story. Mary\nreads that Peter has defeated the Indians, but Wendy and the boys have been\ncaptured by the pirates. He vows to rescue her. E.T. watches them from the\ncloset.\n\n[Here the notion of \"a rescue\" is introduced, and visually associated with\nE.T. as he watches them from the closet. This is an emotional set up for\nthe audience, so that they will later be supportive of Elliott and the\nboy's efforts to rescue E.T.]\n\nMary reads the section of the Peter Pan story where Tinker Bell becomes\npoisoned. Elliott comes into the closet, stands next to E.T., then closes\nthe door behind them.\n\n\"Tinkerbell swallows the draft as Peter's hand reaches for it,\" reads Mary.\n\"Why T, you have drunk my medicine.\"\n\nElliott pulls E.T. away from the door, then shifts through a box of items\nthat he brought up from the garage. He cuts his finger on the blade of a\npower saw, then says \"OUCH,\" as he holds his bleeding finger up into the\nair. E.T. points his own finger towards Elliott. E.T.'s finger glows like a\nlaser light as he says \"ouch.\" He then presses this lit finger on Elliott's\ncut and heals it.\n\n[This establishes the fundamental goodness and healing power of E.T.]\n\nE.T. opens the slit in the closet door and continues to watch Mary read to\nGertie the part where Tinker Bell is dying.\n\n\"She says she thinks she can get well again if children believe in fairies.\nDo you believe in fairies? Say quick that you believe.\"\n\"I DO! I DO! I DO!\" says Gertie.\n\"If you believe, clap your hands.\"\nBoth Gertie and Mary clap their hands. Elliott places a blanket around\nE.T.'s shoulders and a scarf around his neck, as they listen to the rest of\nthe story.\n\"Thank you, thank you. And now to rescue Wendy,\" reads Mary. Elliott places\nhis arm around E.T.\n\n[The Peter Pan story is used to set up the audience's emotional reactions\nto a fairy tale concerning near death and rescue. This emotional empathy\nwill then be transferred to E.T., another \"fairy-like creature\" when he\nbecomes sick and is rescued. Just as the audience felt like clapping for\nTinker Bell, they will applaud the children's efforts to save E.T.]\n\nEXT: HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nExhaust flows from the tailpipe of a van. This is the same type of\npoisonous exhaust image that the audience saw when vans drove into the\nforest at the beginning of the movie.\n\n[Jeopardy: the forces of the antagonist are still nearby.]\n\nINT: BEDROOM: NIGHT\n\nElliott, dressed in white long-johns, sits on his bunkbed as he watches\nE.T. Michael stands next to him. Elliott comments that E.T. is putting\ntogether his instrument, while Mike fears that it might blow up the house.\nHe also comments on the irregularity of E.T.'s breathing.\n\n[More jeopardy, both in Mike's fears of his family and home being\ndestroyed, and in E.T.'s illness becoming progressively worse.]\n\nE.T places his communication device over the Buck Rodgers comic strip.\n\n[This movement establishes a mental association between the device and the\nspaceman's communication efforts in the comic strip.]\n\nPetals drop off the flower in the pot.\n\n[This represents E.T.'s failing health.]\n\nE.T. lifts up his head (which indicates he's using his telekinetic powers),\nthen lifts part of his communication device into the air. He next lifts up\nthe umbrella and opens it. Both objects float in the air in front of him.\n\n[E.T's primary objective is to go home. To accomplish this he must create a\ncommunication device. This is his sub-objective, which appears to be\ncompleted. He next must activate this device from the landing site and call\nhome. The obstacles he has to overcome are Mary, the community, and the\ndistance to the forest. These obstacles will be confronted in the next\nscenes.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S ROOM: DAY\n\nPreparing for Halloween, Elliott paints his lips with makeup. He talks to\nGertie about her going out that night as a ghost. They review the evening\nplans. She will meet them at the lookout.\n\n[This is an example of incomplete exposition which engages the audience.\nThey only talk about part of the plan: the meeting at the lookout. They\ndon't discuss anymore details, such as deceiving Mary into thinking that\nGertie is with them instead of E.T. The partial information forces the\naudience to stay involved with the action and to create their own\nconjectures about what will happen.]\n\nINT: CLOSET: DAY\n\nMike helps Elliot put on his knapsack. Elliott then places a sheet over\nE.T.\n\nINT: STAIRCASE: DAY\n\nE.T., covered with a sheet and clown shoes, walks down the staircase. The\nclown shoes cover his three-toed feet.\n\nINT: HOUSE: DAY\n\nMary walks through the house dressed in a tight fitting leopard skin dress\nwith facial makeup that makes her look like a cat. Mike tells his mother to\nwait and not peek, as he and Elliott lead E.T. into the room. Finally, Mary\nturns and shrieks with glee. She runs to get a camera.\n\n[The tension in the situation is caused by their fear that E.T. will be\ndiscovered by Mary. Mike and Elliott's objective is to get him out of the\nhouse undiscovered.]\n\nE.T. looks through holes cut out for his eyes and sees Michael with a fake\nbutcher knife through his head. He lights up his finger in an attempt to\nheal Mike's wound. Mike grab's E.T.'s hand and puts it back under the\nsheet. \"Ouch, ouch\" says E.T, as he tries once again to heal Mike. \"It's a\nfake knife, it's fake,\" says Mike.\n\n[Laughter is generated because while E.T.'s behavior would be appropriate\nif Mike was really wounded, it is inappropriate in this situation since the\nknife is fake.]\n\nMary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them.\n\n\"You look great,\" says Mary.\n\"Thank you,\" says Mike.\n\"Thank you,\" says Elliott.\n\"Thank you,\" says E.T.\nMary doesn't notice that E.T. has spoken.\n\n[Laughter is generated by the \"rule of three\" humor structure and Mary's\nignorance.]\n\nWhen Mary takes the photo, the flash shocks E.T. and knocks him onto the\nfloor. Mike and Elliott quickly pull him up before Mary notices and lead\nhim out of the house.\n\n[They succeed in their objective with the help of their \"not so smart\"\nmother.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nMary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than\none-hour after sundown. E.T., dressed in the sheet, turns and looks at\nMary, then continues down the driveway with Mike and Elliott.\n\n[This creates a \"timelock\", a sense of urgency, and the expectation of an\nupset mother if they haven't returned by the assigned time.]\n\nEXT: COMMUNITY: DAY\n\nEstablishing shot of the neighborhood. On a hilltop by a fence stands\nanother person in a white sheet (presumably Gertie). She kicks dirt at the\nbicycle near the fence.\n\n[This is the end objective of Mike, Elliot and E.T.: to connect up with\nGertie at the lookout. Their obstacle is to get E.T past all the children\non the streets.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nThe sun is setting. Children in Halloween costumes walk through the\nstreets. E.T. walks between Mike and Elliott, as he watches the other\nchildren parade by. One child dressed as YODA from RETURN OF THE JEDI walks\nby. E.T. turns and walks after him saying \"HOME,HOME.\"\n\n[The laughter is obviously the result of E.T. misinterpreting the situation\nby believing that the child is another alien.]\n\nThey walk towards the setting sun as Mike reminds Elliott that he must be\nback by one hour after sunset. Elliott promises to try, but he wants Mike\nto cover for him.\n\n[This creates jeopardy for the characters, because if they don't complete\ntheir mission within the time frame, they will have trouble with Mary.]\n\nEXT: HILLTOP: DAY\n\nThe sun is setting as Mike, Elliott, and two small characters covered with\nsheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city. Elliott asks Mike to help\nhim lift E.T. onto the bike. Mike does and then tells Elliott that they\nwill be waiting for him.\n\n[They have reached this objective. The next objective for Elliott and E.T\nis to get to the landing site in the forest.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: DAY\n\nElliott, with E.T sitting in the front basket, rides his bicycle through\nthe forest. The road becomes very bumpy. Elliott tells E.T. that they will\nhave to walk from there. Suddenly, E.T. takes control of the bike through\nthe use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward. Eliott becomes\nfrightened as E.T. speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over\nthe edge. E.T. then makes the bike up through the air.\n\n[The audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this\nsurprising and magical turn of events.]\n\nThey continue to fly over the tree tops. Elliott yells \"Not so high, not so\nhigh.\"\n\n[E.T and Elliott both have white hoods over their heads, which further\nvisually reinforces their identification.]\n\nThey ride across the front of the moon, the guiding light of magic. Elliott\nlaughs with glee. When they start their descent he begs E.T. not to crash.\nThey hit the ground. The bike turns over, and both E.T. and Elliott are\nthrown to the ground.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nThe grandfather clock indicates 9:45. Mary watches the clock as she sits in\nfront of lighted candles. The time has long passed when Elliott was\nsupposed to be home. The lighted candles give a church like effect as if\nMary was praying for the safety of her children. She is upset that they\nhaven't returned. She blows out the candles, then taps out another candle\nwith her wand.\n\n[There is jeopardy for the children as Mary and the audience wonder if they\nare okay. Empathy is generated for Mary who is truly concerned for the\nsafety of her children.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nThe sun has set. It's nighttime in the forest. E.T opens a box which\ncontains the saw blade brought to him by Elliott. Elliott ties a rope up to\na tree branch. He then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil\nand points it towards the star-filled sky. It will function as a\ntransmitter. E.T. places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade,\nplugs a cable into a battery, then activates the toy language teaching\ndevice.\n\n[They succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site.\nTheir new objective is to communicate with E.T.'s fellow aliens in order to\naccomplish E.T.'s primary objective, which is to return home.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nMary, still dressed in her leopard outfit, leaves the house. She is very\nupset that her children have not yet returned home. She mumbles to herself,\nsticks the wand in her mouth, and shakes the car keys. She gets into the\ncar and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one.\n\"Mexico!\" she says. She drives down the driveway and into the street to\nsearch for her children.\n\n[This creates more empathy for Mary, who is very upset that her small\nchildren are out this late. The parents in the audience can easily identify\nwith her. But the real function of this scene is to get her out of the\nhouse so that the antagonist can invade their home. She could have stayed\ninside, we never see her in the car searching for the children, and the\nnext time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the kitchen.]\n\nMen get out of a parked car as Mary drives away. They take suitcases out of\na second car, then walk up the driveway to Elliott's house.\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nElliott watches the treetops sway. He scratches his face, as does E.T.\nTogether they stare at the stars. The wind causes the branch to sway, which\nthen pulls the rope, which, in turn, pulls a fork across the saw blade.\nThis drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade,\nand sends signals out into space. Elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it\nworks, while E.T. repeats the word \"Home.\" Together they gaze up to the\nstars.\n\n[They have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space.\nNow, they wait to receive a signal back.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT\n\nThe light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkin's face. More\nlight floods through the slits of Gertie's door. A hand holding a\nflashlight opens Gertie's door, and shines the light into the face of a\nblack doll.\n\n[This has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience\nwho has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face.]\n\nLight from the flashlight searches around Gertie's room.\n\nINT: HALLWAY: NIGHT\n\nA pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair. It\nslowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in Elliott's room. The door to\nElliott's room is shut, with a poster sign hanging on it saying \"DO NOT\nENTER.\" The silhouette of a man passes behind the door, as sounds of a\nGeiger counter filter into the air. Muffled voices are heard as the cord is\npulled to its fullest extent. It forces a chair to slam against the wall.\n\n[This last action has a jarring effect on the audience. Emotionally, the\naudience is outraged at the invasion of the children's rooms, and this\ncreates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts. They are still faceless\nso the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto\nthese characters. This personalizes the story for them and gets them more\nintensely involved on an emotional basis. They also become intellectually\ninvolved, because the sounds of the Geiger counter and the extension of the\ncord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has\nfound E.T.'s \"home\" in the closet. This involves the audience in the story\nmuch more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in\nthe closet.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\n\"We have to go now E.T. It's so late already,\" Elliott says as both he and\nE.T. sadly gaze into the sky.\n\n[Their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved. Their\nsadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience.]\n\nElliott coughs from being out in the cold, damp air.\n\n[This is a setup for the later scenes when both Elliott and E.T. are\ndeathly ill.]\n\nElliott repeats that they really have to go home, but E.T. ignores him and\nhas a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky. Elliott tells\nthem that he has to give them some time. E.T. responds by saying \"ouch,\"\nsignifying that he feels pain. A small fawn watches them from a distance.\n\n[The jeopardy in the scene is due to their being so late. Mary will be very\nangry and they face the obstacle of getting E.T. back into the house\nwithout being discovered. The fawn generates feelings of sympathy in the\naudience which is transferred to E.T. The audience also empathizes with the\nsadness they feel at failing to make contact. For now, supposedly, E.T.\nwon't be able to go home.]\n\n\"You could be happy here. I could take care of you,\" says Elliott\ntearfully. I wouldn't let anybody hurt you. We could grow up together,\nE.T.\"\n\n[Elliott states his primary objective: to always have E.T. with him.]\n\n\"Home, Home,\" says E.T.\n\n[E.T. states his primary objective: to go home.]\n\nElliott sits down and cries. E.T. touches one of his tears.\n\n[The audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT\n\nIt's morning. Elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock. He is\ncovered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him. Next to him\nlies E.T.'s communication device.\n\nElliott coughs, gets up, tugs on the rope which activates the device, then\nlooks around for E.T. but can't find him.\n\n[The new objective: where is E.T. and what has happened to him? This is\nalso the new question that will maintain the audience's interest.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk. Mike and\nGertie sit besides her. A policeman asks Mary how Elliott was dressed when\nshe last saw him. Mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback. The\npoliceman, whose face is not shown (I suppose so that the audience will\nassociate him as \"one of them\"), asks Mary if there is any indication that\nhe might have run away? Were there any family problems or recent arguments?\nMary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has\nnot been easy on the kids.\n\n\"My father is in Mexico,\" says Gertie.\n\n[This scene generates empathy for the whole family.]\n\nMary slams the refrigerator door shut, thereby revealing Elliott standing\nbehind it. White light floods onto him making him look ghastly. Mary hugs\nhim as Mike and Gertie join them.\n\n[The audience is relieved and overjoyed with Elliott's safe return.]\n\n\"Oh Elliott,\" she says as she hugs him. \"Don't ever do this again, Elliott.\nYou're so hot.\"\n\nElliott is feverish from spending the night outside. Mary tells Gertie to\ngo upstairs and draw him a bath. Mary walks over to the policeman (whose\nface is still unseen) and thanks him for his concern.\n\nElliott asks Mike if E.T. is in the house. Mike shakes his head, indicating\nno. Elliot pleads with Mike to find him. He's somewhere in the forest near\nthe bald spot.\n\n[This is the new objective: find E.T. and bring him back.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nMike rides the bicycle with the basket in front down the driveway and into\nthe street, past a car filled with waiting men. The car starts and follows\nMike. He looks behind and realizes that he is being pursued.\n\n[This is a standard chase scene, with a friend who is trying to save the\nlife of the protagonist being pursued. Both he and the protagonist are in\njeopardy. Mike's new sub-objective is to lose those who are following him.]\n\nMike cuts through a backyard and into an alley behind some houses. The car\nfollows him. Mike then rides up an embankment and drives off in the\nopposite direction, leaving the car stranded behind.\n\n[He successfully accomplished his subobjective.]\n\nEXT: FOREST: DAY\n\nMike rides through the forest as he calls out E.T.'s name. He stops and\nsearches for E.T. Mike finds the abandoned communication device, then runs\nup a path and discovers E.T.'s white sheet hanging from the open gate.\n\n[The blue-orange colors of E.T.'s communication device are the same colors\nthat Spielberg chose the logo of his production company, AMBLIN\nENTERTAINMENT.]\n\n[This is the same gate near the landing site that the characters ran past\nin the opening sequence.]\n\nIn another part of the forest, Mike rides his bike on a ridge above a\nstream. E.T lies in the water below, is skin discolored to that of sickly\nwhite. Mike sees him, grabs the sheet, then runs down the embankment. A\nraccoon wanders near E.T. Mike shouts him away, then covers E.T. Mike hears\nthe sounds of a helicopter above him and looks up at the sky.\n\n[Mike has achieved his objective: he has found E.T. But, danger hovers\nabove him in the unseen presence of the ever observing antagonist.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nThe shadow of a man falls on the driveway. The sound of keys jangling is\nheard.\n\n[High jeopardy: the antagonist is about to invade the home of the\nprotagonist.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMike is in the hallway as Mary walks up the stairs. She has a cup of coffee\nin her hand.\n\n[The cup is a prop which will be used to reveal Mary's emotions.]\n\nHe wants her to come with him. He asks her if she remembers the goblin. He\ntries to get her to make a promise, but she is annoyed with him.\n\nINT: BATHROOM: DAY\n\nMichael then opens the door to the bathroom. Elliott is sitting on the\nfloor as Gertie sits on the counter. They are both looking into the\nbathtub. Mary smiles as she walks into the bathroom with the cup of coffee\nin her hand. Then she sees E.T. on the floor. He is a sickly white. He\nextends his arms out towards her. Mary is stunned, as she turns the cup\nover and coffee pours out onto the floor.\n\n[Here a character's non-verbal action with a prop reveals her true\nemotional state. She has lost it.]\n\n\"He's sick. I think we're dying,\" says Elliott. Mary covers her mouth. Mike\ntries to tell her that E.T. won't harm them, but she orders him to take\nGertie downstairs. Gertie cries that he's the man from the moon as Mike\npicks her up and carries her downstairs.\n\n[Elliott, clothed only in white long-john underwear, is visually almost\nidentical to the ghastly white-colored E.T.]\n\nMary picks up Elliott and carries him out of the room as E.T. groans and\nreaches out for them.\n\n[Mary's objective is to save her family from the alien in her home.]\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMary carries Elliott down the stairs. He protests that she can't leave E.T.\nalone. Michael runs down the stairs with Gertie on his back. He opens the\ndoor, freezes, then backs away. Mary, with Elliott in her arms, approaches\nthe door and is confronted by a man in a spacesuit.\n\nMary backs into the living room as the spaceman enters and reaches out for\nher. She goes in the opposite direction, only to run into another man in a\nspacesuit. She runs into the kitchen, followed by Mike carrying Gertie. The\nare blocked by still another spaceman with outstretched arms. Mary and her\nchildren are backed into a corner. Another man in a spacesuit opens up the\nwindow blinds from the outside. Mary shouts \"THIS IS MY HOME.\"\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nDawn. The sun rises as a line of men wearing helmets and uniforms march up\nthe street.\n\nINT: BATHROOM: DAY\n\nE.T., his skin discolored to a grey-white hue, lies on the floor as a man\nin a space suit enters the room. \"Home,\" says E.T.\n\n[This is the end of act two. The antagonist and his forces have invaded the\nhome of the protagonist and taken them into possession. This terrifying\ninvasion of the privacy of their home generates more empathy for Mary and\nher children.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nMen in helmets walk up a street as they push a large plastic tunnel. Police\ncars slowly drive up the street, as faceless men march to a drumbeat.\n\n[This is the beginning of the third act with the forces of the antagonist\nin complete control.]\n\nEXT: STREET: NIGHT\n\nMen with welding torches work on a truck. The plastic tunnel leads up the\ndriveway to Elliott's house. The faces of the men are still not shown. They\nare either wearing helmets or are silhouettes.\n\nCLOSEUP\n\nThe man with keys jangling on his side is putting on a pair of light-blue\npants.\n\nINTERCUT: STREET\n\nMen are working outside. Large bright lights flood the area.\n\nINTERCUT: \"KEYS\"\n\nThe man in the blue suit puts on a white pair of plastic gloves. Red and\nblack colors on his cuff are associated with his keys as ominous music\nfills the soundtrack.\n\n[This is the only instance in this film where the traditional colors of the\nantagonist (red and black) are associated with the antagonist (\"keys\").\nPutting on a light-blue outfit starts the transformation of the antagonist\ninto a character worthy of audience empathy, for blue-white is the\ntraditional production design colors signifying \"innocence.\"]\n\nThe man in the light-blue suit gets up walks through the plastic tunnel\ntowards Elliott's house. He exits the tunnel and walks into the house which\nhas been completely enclosed by plastic.\n\nFinally, the antagonist's face is shown. His head is covered by a blue hood\nwhile a light under his face mask accentuates his white shirt.\n\nMary stands in the middle of the room with Gertie at her side. A doctor\nasks her questions about E.T., but Mary is more concerned with Elliott's\nstate. A nurse cuts a lock from Gertie's hair (presumably for analysis),\nwhile both Elliott and E.T. can be seen on a video monitor. This nurse\nwalks to Mike and cuts a piece of his hair while a doctor asks him\nquestions about E.T. A video monitor shows Elliott and E.T. \"Elliott thinks\nhis thoughts,\" asks the doctor. \"No, Elliott feels his feelings,\" answers\nMichael.\n\n[This is the first time in the film that the merging of Elliott and E.T.\nhas been explicitly stated. Yet, this condition has been revealed to the\naudience non-verbally throughout the story. The verbalization seems\nredundant and not necessary, but does make sense as an explanatory comment\nto a character new to the story.]\n\nINT: CHAMBER: DAY\n\nA man stands in what appears to be a decontamination chamber.\n\nINTERCUT: MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nHands push buttons on electronic equipment used to gather medical\ninformation about Elliott and E.T. Graphs representing E.T. and Elliott run\nin exact parallel.\n\n[This is another representation of the fact that E.T. and Elliott have\nmerged and are to be considered as one being.]\n\nINT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY\n\nTwo people in white suits zip open a plastic covering and enter the room\nwhere Elliot and E.T. are being examined.\n\n[The color white traditionally signifying purity. A transition in the\naudience's emotional alliances is being manipulated at this stage of the\nstory. Their hatred will be transferred from \"keys\" who will become much\nmore sympathetic to \"death itself\" which threatens the life of E.T. It\nwould be too much to ask of the adult audience to remain sympathetic to the\nemotional pleadings of a child when space scientists are trying to save the\nlife of a sick alien.]\n\n\"You're scaring him,\" cries Elliott, as the doctors examine both Elliott\nand E.T. as they lie on adjacent tables. E.T's head rests on a blue piece\nof cloth.\n\n\"Leave him alone, leave him alone. I can take care of him,\" moans Elliott.\n\n[Which, of course, he can't. But this is something that both he, and\nprobably most of the children in the audience, really believe.]\n\nElliott looks up into the face of \"Keys,\" who says that he's been to the\nforest. He wants to know what the machine does. Elliott says that it's a\ncommunication machine, and asks if it's still working. He then states that\n\"He came to me. He came to me.\" \"Keys\" explains that he's been wishing for\nthis too, ever since he was ten years old. He doesn't want the alien to\ndie. He asks what more can they do that they are not already doing.\n\nElliott's image reflects in \"Keys\" face gear. Elliott tells him that E.T.\nwas calling his people because he needs to go home.\n\n[\"Keys\" is no longer the threat. He has been transformed into a friend who\nalso wants to help the alien. A new antagonist must now be created in order\nto maintain conflict in the story. In this scene DEATH will serve that\nfunction. For the rest of the film the forces of the United States\nGovernment, who attempt to block E.T.'s escape, will function as the\nantagonist.]\n\nAnother Doctor dressed in white enters the room and announces that E.T. has\nDNA. Suddenly, a display screen shows a drop in E.T. and Elliott's graphs.\nOne doctor says there's a drop in the creature's blood temperature, while\nanother states that Elliott's condition is stabilizing: his blood pressure\nis coming back up.\n\nE.T. calls Elliott's name, and the medical personnel become aware that he\ncan talk. Elliott pleads with him to stay. E.T. repeats the words \"stay,\nstay,\" then slowly turns his head away.\n\nTheir graphs separate. One doctor announces that the boy is coming back,\nbut they are losing E.T.\n\nINT: CLOSET: NIGHT\n\nMichael enters the closet space where E.T. stayed. He looks at the objects,\nincluding the cartoon page from the newspaper, then huddles down among\nE.T.'s possessions.\n\n[These actions create more empathy for Michael who suffers at the thought\nof losing E.T.]\n\nThe is a time transition, for Michael is asleep in E.T.'s space when the\nmorning sun shines on his face. Michael wakes up, then watches the plant\n(which represents E.T.'s life force) wilt. He screams.\n\nINT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY\n\n\"E.T., don't go\" screams Elliott.\n\nDoctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or\nrespiration. A bell rings, which signifies a life and death situation.\nDoctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding\nE.T.\n\n\"Leave him alone. You're killing him,\" says Elliott. They wheel Elliott out\nof the room as he continues to scream. The medical staff frantically tries\nto revive E.T. They try electrical shocks, but that fails. Gertie holds her\ndoll as she watches. She reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are\napplied to E.T.\n\n[Showing one character's reactions to a situation help to create the\nintended reaction in the audience.]\n\nThe doctors are losing him. Elliott watches and cries. Mary goes to him and\nthey hug each other. Gertie cries as she holds her doll. Mike walks into\nthe room, as \"Keys\" watches, then turns away.\n\n[This provides the audience with each character's reaction to the death of\nE.T. This is a surprising event for the audience: the protagonist has died.\nEmotionally, it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will\nbecome overjoyed when he is brought back to life.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nA white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway.\n\n[Previously, the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark\ncolors. The color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined\ncolor associations to manipulate the audience's emotional responses.]\n\nPolice and other officials walk past a white van, white truck, police cars\nand other white vehicles towards a tan colored car. Mike's friends sit on\ntheir bikes behind police barriers. They make comments that something has\njust happened inside the house.\n\n[This establishes the existence of Mike's friends who will play a crucial\nrole in the last chase scene.]\n\nINT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY\n\nThe medical staff gives up on E.T. and decide to pack him in ice. Mike\nwatches as the staff of E.T. slowly walks away. \"Keys\" removes his headgear\nand walks to Elliott who is standing vigil over E.T.'s body. \"Keys\" then\napproaches E.T. Mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his\nheadgear. The faces of several medical attendants are shown.\n\n[This humanizes the forces of the antagonist and makes them much less\nthreatening. That's why they had to be faceless for so long throughout the\nstory.]\n\n\"Keys\" kneels besides E.T. and with gloved hand closes his eyes. Mary holds\nGertie. When Gerite asks if he's dead, Mary replies that she thinks so.\nGertie then says she wishes him back.\n\n[The interchange between Gertie and Mary reminds the audience of the Tinker\nBell situation when Mary read to her from Peter Pan. Those same feelings\nare reintroduced here: the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the\ndesire to rescue the children. This is the payoff to the emotional\nreactions set up in that earlier scene.]\n\n\"Keys\" looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with\nice into which they will place E.T.'s body.\n\nMary picks up Gertie and carries her out of the room. Medical technicians\nprepare the casing as Elliott watches. Keys approaches Elliot and tells him\nthat they will be taking E.T. away. \"They are just going to cut him all\nup,\" replies Elliott.\n\n[This is the payoff to the frog sequence. The audience believes that\nElliott is correct, given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the\nteacher. They also now remember the joy they felt when Elliott freed the\nfrogs, and wish they could experience that again now.]\n\n\"Do you want to spend some time alone with him?\" asks \"Keys,\" as he puts\nhis arm around Elliott and walks him to the casing. He tells the medical\nattendants to leave the room.\n\n[This generates empathy for \"Keys\" who is shown to be concerned for\nElliott's feelings.]\n\nThe attendants walk out of the room past Michael who is watching Elliott.\n\"Keys\" leaves Elliott alone with the body of E.T., which is covered in a\nplastic bag as it lies on dry ice. Elliott stares down at E.T.\n\n\"Look at what they've done to you. I'm so sorry. You must be dead. I... I\ndidn't know how to feel. I can't feel anything anymore. You've gone\nsomeplace else now. E.T., I love you.\"\n\n[Elliott wears a partially open white-jacket. He is framed within an oval\nshaped glass.]\n\nElliott places the cover down over E.T. and walks away from the oval glass.\nA red-light flashes from inside the casing, but Elliott doesn't notice this\nas he walks away. He passes the pot of wilted flowers. The flowers slowly\nstart to regain strength. Elliott notices this, then quickly returns the\ncasing.\n\n[This is the payoff for the pot-of-wilted-flowers prop.]\n\nHe opens the casing, sees the red-light flashing from E.T.'s heart, then\nzips open the plastic bag. The alien looks up and says \"E.T. phone home.\"\nElliott screams with joy.\n\"Home, home, home, home,\" says E.T.\n\"Does this mean they are coming?\" asks Elliott.\n\"Yes,\" answers E.T.\n\n[E.T. has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home.]\n\nElliott tells him to stay and shut up, as he places his hand over E.T.'s\nmouth. Elliott zips him back up, then places a cloth over his flashing\nred-heart, as \"KEYS\" re-enters the room. Elliott slams down the cover.\n\"KEYS\" pulls Elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its\nremoval. Elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he\nsees the wilted flowers regain their health. The attendants lock the case.\n\nINT: DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER: DAY\n\nElliott tells Mike that E.T. is alive. Mike's also overjoyed. Mike and\nElliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom.\n\nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMary is talking to \"KEYS\" as Gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her\nhands. He asks Mary if the boys have gone because she's sup- posed to give\nher a note when they have gone. Mary takes the note from Gertie and reads\nit.\n\n[This note provides the crisis to which Mary must react, yet the audience\nis kept in suspense.]\n\nEXT: PLASTIC TUNNEL: DAY\n\nElliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue, then enters the\nback of the van. Elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate\nthe drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal Michael in the\ndriver's seat. He to is wearing a blue jacket. Elliott yells at Mike for\nnot wearing his mask. Suddenly, a black official walks by the van, spots\nMike in the driver's seat, and knocks on the window. He holds a\nwalkie-talkie in his hand as he asks Mike who he is. Mike responds that\nhe's driving. The official tells Mike to open the door. When Mike looks to\nElliott for advice, Elliott tells him to drive away.\n\n[Elliott and Mike's objective is to escape with E.T.]\n\nA group of men approach the van. Mike screams that he's never driven\nforward before, shifts into first gear, and drives away.\n\n[This is the payoff to the scene of Mike incompetently backing the car down\nthe driveway.]\n\nAs Mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men\nstill inside. Mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him\nat the playground at the top of he hill. He then drives away, pursued by a\ngroup of men. Mike's friends put on their hats and sun- glasses, and join\nthe fray.\n\n[The chase is on. Suspense is created because the audience wonders whether\nthey will get E.T. back to the forest before the are stopped. They face\nimpossible odds, yet Mike's friends display loyalty as they join the fight.\nMike and Elliott's first objective is to reach the park. Their major\nobstacle is the men trying to capture them.]\n\nMike drives the van down the street. The two men still in the plastic\ntunnel try to climb back towards the van. Elliott starts to disconnect the\ntunnel by pulling out metal braces.\n\n[Jeopardy: If these men get into the van, they will overpower Elliott and\nMike, and prevent E.T. from getting home.]\n\nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY\n\nMary backs her car out of the garage. Gertie is sitting next to her in the\nfront seat holding onto the flower pot. \"Keys\" runs up to Mary and asks\nwhere she's going. Gertie blunts out \"to the spaceship.\"\n\n[\"Keys\" now realizes that the aliens are returning for E.T. This is his\n\"crisis\" information, that spurns him into action.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nThe van continues down the road, still pulling the plastic tunnel behind\nit. The two men have almost made it to the back of the van as Elliott pulls\nout the final stake. He tosses it to one of the men. When Mike turns a\nsharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects, leaving the two men behind.\n\n[They have overcome their immediate obstacle. Humor is generated when\nElliott tosses the nail to one of the men, because it is the reversal of a\nlife saving situation. Instead of catching something (like a rope) that\nwill save him, he catches the object that is his undoing.]\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nA convoy of police cars drive up a street.\n\n[The chase is still on. Even though one obstacle has been overcome, the\nantagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight. The protagonist is\nstill in jeopardy.]\n\nEXT: PARK: DAY\n\nThe white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park. It swerves\nbetween the children's rides, then finally stops. Smoke pours out of the\nvan, whose back two doors are still open.\n\n[They have reached their sub-objective: the park where they are to meet up\nwith Mike's friends and continue on their bikes.]\n\nMike's friends wait on their bikes. Between them they also have bikes for\nElliott and Mike. E.T. is revealed to the boys. He stands among the smoke\nfrom the dry-ice with his red-heart light flashing. \"Okay, he's a man from\nouter space and we're taking him to his spaceship,\" says Elliott, now\ndressed in blue pants, white shirt, and red jacket.\n\"Why can't he just beam up?\" asks Greg.\n\"This is reality, Greg,\" says Elliott.\n\n[Of course, the joke is that it isn't reality. It is a fantasy movie with a\nrealistic response to a fantastic situation. Right?]\n\n[Elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of Mike's friends,\nsomething he's desired from his introduction scene when they wouldn't allow\nhim to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with them.]\n\nEXT: PARK: DAY\n\nMary, along with a crowd of plain clothes police, run towards the van.\n\"Don't shoot, they're only children,\" screams Mary.\n\n[This introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene. It also\ncharacterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot\nchildren.]\n\nThey reach the back of the van only to find it empty.\n\nEXT: STREET: DAY\n\nElliott and friends ride down the street. E.T., covered with a white\nblanket, rides in Elliott's basket. Elliott, with the red hood over his\nhead, shouts that they are to ride to the forest.\n\n[To cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes. This helps the\naudience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace\nis fast and the action intense. Spielberg used this technique for Elliot in\nthis scene and for Marion in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK when she runs through\nthe market chased by Arabs.]\n\nCars chase them. Elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow\nhim. Police cars encircle them and try to cut them off. The bikers turn off\nthe main road and ride into a dirt field. A tan car with \"UNITED STATES\nGOVERNMENT\" written on the driver's door rides parallel to the bikers.\n\nTwo men ride inside the tan car. One speaks into the car radio saying that\nthey'll get them at the bottom of the hill. The tan car pulls into the base\nof the hill and stops. One man gets out and starts to climb up the\nembankment. The bikers almost run him over. They ride over the hood of the\ncar, then continue down the street, now pursued by a blue police car.\n\nThe bikers cycle down a dirt road of a section of the community that is\nstill under development. E.T., with the white blanket covering his head,\nsits in the basket of Elliott's bike. A blue car trails them. The bikers\ndecide to split up. Two ride down an embankment. They are followed by\nanother police car. The bikers then escape from their pursuers by riding\ndown steep embankments. The cars cannot follow and must stop on different\nlevels. The bikers unite and ride away.\n\n[It seems that the chase is over and they have eluded the antagonist.]\n\nThe biker's are overjoyed by their victory. One takes off his hat, waves it\nin the air, and shouts \"We've made it!\" Suddenly, he quickly ducks to avoid\nbeing grabbed by a man. A group of men continue the chase. Several cars\npull up ahead and form a blockade in the road.\n\nElliott and E.T. ride forward. Horror grows on Elliott's face as he stares\nat the enemy in front of him.\n\n[This final confrontation between the protagonist (Elliott and E.T.) and\nthe antagonist.]\n\nThe antagonist is explicitly revealed at this moment. On the side panel of\na car is a sign stating:\n\n                           FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n                              U.S. GOVERNMENT\n                           INTERAGENCY MOTOR POOL\n                                    GSA\n\nThe shadow of a shotgun covers the sign. Next, two shotguns are raised\nagainst E.T. and Elliott.\n\nElliott shuts his eyes with fear. There is a closeup of E.T.'s face. With\nshotguns drawn, government agents gesture for them to stop.\n\n[This is the life and death final moment before the climax. The audience\nhas been set up to expect that the government agents would shoot at the\nprotagonist by Mary's comments in the park scene.]\n\nSuddenly, E.T. saves the day with his telekinetic powers. He lifts all of\nthe bikers up into the air as they fly above the blockade.\n\n[The climax is over E.T. has saved himself and his friends]\n\nE.T. then flies the bikers over the housetops, and across the setting sun.\nFinally they float down onto a path in the forest.\n\nEXT: FOREST: DAY\n\nElliott has reached the landing site. He brushes the leaves away from the\nturntable of the communication device. A blue-light floods Elliott's face.\nHe looks up into the, along with the other bikers. E.T., with red-heart\nhappily flashing, also gazes into the sky as his spaceship descends.\n\"Home,\" says E.T.\nThe spaceship continues its descent as E.T.'s red-heart flutters. The\nspaceship finally lands in a golden glowing light.\n\nA car pulls into the forest, and Gertie's voice can be heard pointing out\nthe location of the boys. The ramp to the spaceship lowers. Gertie runs up\nto Mike and E.T. She gives E.T. the plant and says that she just wanted to\nsay goodbye. Michael responds that E.T. doesn't know goodbye.\n\"Be good,\" says E.T.\n\"Yes,\" says Gertie, as she kisses him on the nose.\nMike places his hand on E.T.'s head.\n\n[This is a basic gesture of trust. The fact that E.T. allows Mike to do\nthis indicates that he considers him a friend.]\n\nE.T. puts the plant on the ground, as Mary and \"Keys\" run up to the edge of\nthe site. Mike picks up Gertie and carries her away as Elliott approaches\nE.T.\n\n\"Come,\" says E.T\n\"Stay,\" says Elliott.\n\n[The two characters that had merged into one protagonist must split apart\nbecause they now have different primary objectives. E.T. want's to return\nhome, and Elliott wants him to remain.]\n\nE.T. lifts his finger to his lips and says \"ouch.\"\n\n[Of course, this indicates the pain he feels in their separation.]\n\nElliott tearfully lifts his finger to his lips and says \"ouch.\"\n\n[The symmetry of his movements indicate that in some sense, they still are\none.]\n\nE.T. and Elliott hug each other as the are visually surrounded by blue and\nwhite lights. Then Elliott and Mary exchange glances as Mike and Gertie\nstand by and watch. E.T. lifts his finger to Elliott's forehead. It lights\nup, then he says: \"I'll be right here.\"\n\n[The resolution of the dilemma. Though E.T. leaves, he will still remain,\nperhaps telepathically, or perhaps only within Elliott's thoughts.]\n\n\"Bye,\" says Elliott..\n\nE.T. picks up the potted plant and carries it up the gangplank. Elliott\nwatches from below as Harvey starts up the plank, then returns to Elliott's\nside.\n\n[E.T. leaves with what he really came for, a sample of the earth's\nvegetative life form. But now he has much more in the flowers that will\nserve as a memorial of all that he has experienced with his new friends.]\n\nThe gangplank lifts up and separates E.T. from Elliott. The ships circular\nentrance closes. The spaceship lifts off. Elliott watches it float up into\nthe sky. It then speeds away, leaving an orange-blue rainbow behind against\nthe blue-morning sky.\n\n[Orange and blue were also the colors of E.T.'s makeshift communication\ndevice as found by Mike in the forest.]\n\nMary watches and laughs with happiness. The other boys also watch, as Mike\nholds Gertie in his arms. The film ends with a shot of Elliott gazing up\ninto the sky.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\nE.T.\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Melissa Mathison\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Family\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Fantasy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:24:19.746871"}
