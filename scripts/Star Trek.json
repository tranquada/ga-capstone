VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK\n\n     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,\n     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm\n     water runs down its face and body.\n\n     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the\n     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind\n     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the\n     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:\n\n                                 MIDWIFE\n                He is strong.\n\n     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out\n     to the new MOTHER:\n\n     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a\n     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly\n     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.\n     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                ... hello.\n\n     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.\n     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:\n\n                              YOUNGER MIDWIFE\n                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?\n\n                              MIDWIFE\n                        (a beat; then)\n                She is human.\n\n     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking\n     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,\n     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.\n\n                                 MIDWIFE (CONT'D)\n                Sarek arrives.\n\n     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for\n     a moment, clearly disquieted.\n\n\n\n\n15A   OMIT                                                              15A\n\n15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B\n\n      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities\n      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the\n      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the\n      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built\n      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.\n\n      A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.\n\n      The speeder parks outside the home --\n\n15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C\n\n      SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the\n      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He\n      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:\n\n                                  SAREK\n                 Well done.\n\n      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just\n      enough rancor:\n\n                                  AMANDA\n                 Thanks.\n\n      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --\n\n                               SAREK\n                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The\n                 Science Council required my presence for\n                 a session regarding--\n\n                                  AMANDA\n                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you\n                 here.\n\n      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.\n      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a\n      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,\n      clinically:\n\n                               SAREK\n                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is\n                 traditionally not present at the moment\n                 of delivery.\n\n                                AMANDA\n                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one\n                 giving birth.\n                         (then)\n                                (MORE)\n\n                                               3\n15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C\n                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)\n                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to\n                   be with you. I needed you to be with me\n                   today. Holding my hand and telling me\n                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...\n                   breathing the best I can.\n\n      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at\n      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers\n      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:\n\n                                 SAREK\n                   You are correct. I should have been\n                   here. I am sorry.\n\n      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses\n      him. And the two look at the baby.\n\n                                 SAREK (CONT'D)\n                   I had a thought. That we might name the\n                   child after one of our respected early\n                   society-builders. His name was \"Spock\".\n\n      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.\n\n                                 SAREK (CONT'D)\n                   Your silence does not suggest enormous\n                   enthusiasm.\n\n                                  AMANDA\n                   No... Spock.\n                           (smiles, touches his\n                            face)\n                   ... Spock.\n\n      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.\n\n                                 SAREK\n                   The child has your eyes.\n\n      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She\n      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,\n      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.\n\n                                 AMANDA\n                   ... and your ears.\n\n      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,\n      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM\n      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER \"THREE YEARS LATER\" APPEARS\n      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS\n      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:\n\n                                                4\n\n\n15D   INT.

He turns --\n     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING\n     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in\n     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:\n\n                              YOUNG SPOCK\n                I did not mean to create conflict between\n                you and mother.\n\n     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.

But you may choose the\n                  ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity\n                  humans seldom experience.

But he holds steady:\n\n                                SAREK\n                  As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to\n                  observe and understand human behavior.\n                  Marrying your mother... was logical.\n                          (Spock seems disquieted)\n                  Spock.

We realize that the constant shocks of light was\n      LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:\n      \"RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID\". And we see they're\n      heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING\n      ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to\n      find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.\n      And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --\n      THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses\n      Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And\n      offers his cuffed hands, willingly.\n\n54A   INT.

Cold as fucking\n      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:\n      A DRAWING OF SPOCK.

But because the Romulans\n                   deny your existence, I believe you are\n                   much more than that.\n\n      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches\n      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-\n      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.\n\n                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)\n                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.\n                   We've been asking for its secrets for too\n                   long.

She begins adjusting his\n      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying\n      like hell to look impassive.\n\n                               AMANDA (CONT'D)\n                 There is no need to be so anxious.\n                 You'll do fine.\n\n                               SPOCK\n                 I am hardly \"anxious\", mother.\n                         (beat, then, anxiously)\n                 And \"fine\" has variable definitions.\n                 \"Fine\" is unacceptable.\n\n      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it\n      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his\n      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he\n      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.\n\n                                                 29\n57   CONTINUED:                                                           57\n\n                                SPOCK (CONT'D)\n                  May I ask a personal query?\n\n                                  AMANDA\n                  ... anything.\n\n                                SPOCK\n                  Should I choose to complete the Vulcan\n                  discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all\n                  emotion...

VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58\n\n     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before\n     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL.

I see you\n                  have applied to Starfleet as well.\n\n                                SPOCK\n                  It was logical to cultivate multiple\n                  options.\n\n                                SCIENCE MINISTER\n                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby\n                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.\n                  A distinction all the more significant\n                  given that you will be its first half-\n                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,\n                  Spock. That you have achieved so much\n                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to\n                  the Academy.\n\n     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:\n\n                                SPOCK\n                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what\n                  \"disadvantage\" are you referring to?\n\n                                SCIENCE MINISTER\n                  ... your human mother.\n\n                                               30\n58   CONTINUED:                                                         58\n\n     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same\n     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his\n     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.\n     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes\n     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --\n\n                                SPOCK\n                  Council -- ministers.
