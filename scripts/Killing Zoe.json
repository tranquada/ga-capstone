TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY\n</b>\n       Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi \n       zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.\n\n       Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the \n       cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic \n       loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not \n       permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that \n       they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other \n       automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get \n       their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is \n       Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\".\n\n       Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE \n       UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes \n       shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red \n       hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.\n\n       He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy \n       going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                 Hotel Mondial.\n\n<b>                           CAB DRIVER\n</b>                 Le Mondial.

From \n       around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.\n\n       Zed is right behind him.\n\n       They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.\n\n<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n       The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, \n       walks into the room.\n\n       He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and \n       proceeds to show him the room.\n\n       Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                     (in broken English)\n                 Your package...It arrived in the last \n                 night of before last night.\n\n       He points to the telephone.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                 Ah...telephone, for the room service.\n\n       He motions toward the bathroom.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                 The toilet.\n\n       He opens the closet door.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                 To hang the clothes.\n\n       He points to a control console next to the bed.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                 From here you can operate the television.\n\n       Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.\n\n       Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, \n       he starts fingering through it.\n\n       Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which \n       bills to give him.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                     (after getting what he wanted)\n                 Merci.\n\n       He starts to leave.\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                 Oh, wait.\n\n       The bellboy turns around.\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                 What time is it?\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                     (confused)\n                 What time is it?\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                     (pointing at his watch)\n                 Time.\n\n<b>                           BELLBOY\n</b>                 Ah.

Before he \n       dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on \n       the bedside table.\n\n       He is asleep.\n\n<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK:\n</b>\n<b>       INT.

Inside \n       of it is a black steel briefcase.\n\n       The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.\n\n       On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.  \n       Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of \n       folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:  \n<b>       45.63.53.37.\n</b>\n<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY\n</b>\n       Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his \n       face and cascade down his body.\n\n       He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits \n       some out with a spurt.\n\n       Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.\n\n       He turns the shower off.\n\n       Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.\n\n<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY\n</b>\n       Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his \n       way toward the knocking.\n\n<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n       Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped \n       around his waist.  He opens it.\n\n       In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than \n       twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but \n       she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.\n\n<b>                           ZOEY\n</b>                 Bonjour.\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                     (a little awkwardly)\n                 Bonjour.\n\n       Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the \n       room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way \n       to the window for a view of the city.\n\n<b>                           ZOEY\n</b>                 Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.

A French talk show comes \n       on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station \n       playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, \"Nosferatu\".  She \n       smiles and sits back to watch.\n\n<b>                           ZED(O.S.)\n</b>                     (from the bathroom)\n                 What's your name?\n\n<b>                           ZOEY\n</b>                 Zoe or Zoey.

We both have Z names.\n\n       Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His \n       pants are on.\n\n<b>                           ZED\n</b>                 What was that?\n\n       She notices his pants.\n\n<b>                           ZOEY\n</b>                 You can take those off.

Zed.\n\n       Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she \n       slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her \n       eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.\n\n<b>                           ZOEY\n</b>                 Slow enough for you?\n\n       Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the \n       bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.\n\n       She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin \n       to make love.\n\n       On the television, \"Nosferatu\" silently plays.\n\n       Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't \n       resist during a moment of passion.\n\n       She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.
