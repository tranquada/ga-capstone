TAXI CAB - MOVING - DAY\n\n       Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi \n       zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport.\n\n       Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the \n       cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic \n       loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not \n       permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that \n       they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other \n       automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get \n       their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is \n       Angelique Kidjo's funky song \"Batonga\".\n\n       Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE \n       UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes \n       shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red \n       hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside.\n\n       He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy \n       going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.\n\n                           ZED\n                 Hotel Mondial.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Le Mondial.  Tres bien.\n\n       He starts driving.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Avec cette pluie ca risque de prendre un \n                 moment.  L'autoroute est ferme.  A cause \n                 du 14 Juillet.\n\n       He drives for a while.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 [Do you mind the radio?]\n\n       Zed looks at the meter, francs are clicking away.  He also \n       looks at the cab driver's license, his name is Moises Du \n       Bois.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 [Do you want me to turn the radio off?]\n\n                           ZED\n                     (realizing he's being asked a \n                      question)\n                 I don't speak French.\n\n       The driver turns around.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                     (in broken English)\n                 Ah.  American?\n\n                           ZED\n                 That's right.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 That's good because I speak a little \n                 English.\n\n       Zed nods.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 I asked if you mind the radio.  Music.  \n                 You know.\n\n       Zed shakes his head \"no\".\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                     (with a smile)\n                 Super cool.\n\n       Zed adjusts his watch.\n\n                           ZED\n                 What time is it?\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Time, time, time.  I don't know.  \n                 Daytime.\n\n       Zed forgets the adjustment for now.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Are you in town for business?\n\n                           ZED\n                 Yes.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 It's a nice hotel.  Your hotel.  Very big \n                 rooms.\n\n       He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Do you know Paris?\n\n                           ZED\n                 I've been here once before.  When I was \n                 younger.\n\n       The cab driver smiles.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Those were the days.\n\n       They drive for a while.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Married?\n\n                           ZED\n                 I beg your pardon?\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Do you have a wife?\n\n                           ZED\n                 No.\n                     (then after thinking about it \n                      for a while)\n                 Why?\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Well, if you need a wife for the night...\n                     (searching for the right words \n                      in French)\n                 Une escorte.  Pour vous faire visiter.\n                     (then back to his broken \n                      English)\n                 For business.  I give you my number.  \n                 Very nice girl.  French.  Like when you \n                 were young.\n\n       He lifts his hand and shows his index and middle finger \n       tightly extended together, then he crosses them.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Know what I mean?\n\n       Zed smiles at this and nods.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 Speaks the language of love.  Take you to \n                 heaven and back.  You just tell me and I \n                 set it up.\n\n       Zed shakes his head and laughs.\n\n                           CAB DRIVER\n                 What you laughing at?  You let Moises set \n                 it up.  She treat you right.  She treat \n                 you fine.\n\n       Zed can do nothing but smile at the thought of it.\n\n                                                       DISSOLVE TO:\n\n       INT. HOTEL - HALL - DAY\n\n       A long, empty hallway of a moderately priced hotel.  From \n       around a corner comes a BELLBOY carrying Zed's one bag.\n\n       Zed is right behind him.\n\n       They come up to room 6A and the bellboy unlocks the door.\n\n       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n       The door to the room opens and the bellboy, followed by Zed, \n       walks into the room.\n\n       He puts Zed's bag onto one of those luggage holders and \n       proceeds to show him the room.\n\n       Sitting on the bed is a large air freight package.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                     (in broken English)\n                 Your package...It arrived in the last \n                 night of before last night.\n\n       He points to the telephone.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                 Ah...telephone, for the room service.\n\n       He motions toward the bathroom.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                 The toilet.\n\n       He opens the closet door.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                 To hang the clothes.\n\n       He points to a control console next to the bed.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                 From here you can operate the television.\n\n       Then he pauses at the door before he goes out.\n\n       Zed reaches into his pocket and takes out some French money, \n       he starts fingering through it.\n\n       Then, the bellboy takes the liberty of showing Zed which \n       bills to give him.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                     (after getting what he wanted)\n                 Merci.\n\n       He starts to leave.\n\n                           ZED\n                 Oh, wait.\n\n       The bellboy turns around.\n\n                           ZED\n                 What time is it?\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                     (confused)\n                 What time is it?\n\n                           ZED\n                     (pointing at his watch)\n                 Time.\n\n                           BELLBOY\n                 Ah.  Yes.  Il est presque huit heures \n                 moins dix.\n\n       The bellboy clicks his heels and walks out the door.\n\n       Zed looks around the room, still wondering what time it is, \n       and takes a seat on the bed.\n\n       Obviously tired from the flight Zed unbuttons his shirt a bit \n       and lays back on the bed next to the package.  Before he \n       dozes off to sleep he takes his watch off and places it on \n       the bedside table.\n\n       He is asleep.\n\n                                                     FADE TO BLACK:\n\n       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER - DAY\n\n       Zed's bed, while still made, looks like it's been slept in.  \n       Sitting on it is the ripped open air freight package.  Inside \n       of it is a black steel briefcase.\n\n       The shower is on and from the look of things Zed is in it.\n\n       On the bedside table we see Zed's watch.  It reads 12:10 P.M.  \n       Next to it is the phone.  Next to the phone is a piece of \n       folded paper with Moises' name and a phone number that reads:  \n       45.63.53.37.\n\n       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - SHOWER - DAY\n\n       Zed is in the shower letting the water run directly into his \n       face and cascade down his body.\n\n       He opens his mouth and freely drinks the water, then he spits \n       some out with a spurt.\n\n       Then he stops, attentive, listening for something.\n\n       He turns the shower off.\n\n       Then he hears it again, the knocking on the door.\n\n       INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY\n\n       Zed grabs a towel and climbs out of the shower.  He makes his \n       way toward the knocking.\n\n       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY\n\n       Zed walks to the door to his room with the towel wrapped \n       around his waist.  He opens it.\n\n       In the hall is ZOEY, a cute French girl of not more than \n       twenty.  She's chewing on gum the way a schoolgirl might, but \n       she looks like no girl Zed ever went to school with.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Bonjour.\n\n                           ZED\n                     (a little awkwardly)\n                 Bonjour.\n\n       Zed opens up the door and lets her in.  She checks out the \n       room and places her bag on the bed.  Then she makes her way \n       to the window for a view of the city.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Wow.  Vous avez une belle chambre.  Je ne \n                 suis jamais venue dans cet hotel.\n\n       She turns to him, but in the process takes the time to \n       examine every detail of the room.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Ca sera 150 francs de l'heure.  Toute la \n                 nuit pour 700.  D'avance.  Et faudra \n                 porter un--\n\n                           ZED\n                 I...don't speak French.\n\n       She blows a bubble.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 It's okay.\n\n       She takes a seat on the bed.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 It will be one thousand francs for all \n                 night.  In advance.\n\n       Zed takes the money out of his wallet and gives it to her.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 We can do it now if you want.\n\n                           ZED\n                 Well, let me just dry up.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Okay, but it's not necessary.\n\n       He goes into the bathroom and starts drying himself.\n\n       She puts the money in her bag and then turns on the \n       television from the remote console.  A French talk show comes \n       on.  She changes the channel until she comes to a station \n       playing F.W. Murnau's silent classic, \"Nosferatu\".  She \n       smiles and sits back to watch.\n\n                           ZED(O.S.)\n                     (from the bathroom)\n                 What's your name?\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Zoe or Zoey.  Which ever you like.\n\n                           ZED(O.S.)\n                 My name's Zed.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                     (smiling at this)\n                 That's funny.  We both have Z names.\n\n       Zed comes walking out of the bathroom drying his hair.  His \n       pants are on.\n\n                           ZED\n                 What was that?\n\n       She notices his pants.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 You can take those off.  The pants.\n\n                           ZED\n                 I'd rather watch you get undressed first.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                     (matter-of-factly)\n                 Alright.\n\n       She stands up and starts to lift her top off.  He stops her.\n\n                           ZED\n                 Slower.\n\n       He lays down on the bed.\n\n       She stands there looking at him and then smiles.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Alright Mister America.  Zed.\n\n       Then, with Zed laying on the bed and watching her, she \n       slowly, seductively strips in front of him, never taking her \n       eyes from his eyes, until she is totally naked.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 Slow enough for you?\n\n       Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the \n       bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants.\n\n       She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin \n       to make love.\n\n       On the television, \"Nosferatu\" silently plays.\n\n       Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't \n       resist during a moment of passion.\n\n       She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.

I make things.  Objects.  \n                 Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with \n                 no narrative.  I want when someone looks \n                 at one of my objects for there to be no \n                 reference to the world.  Void of feeling, \n                 emotion...void of destiny.  Those are \n                 left for me.  They belong only to me.  If \n                 someone else can see into it...then it is \n                 no longer mine.  I have failed.

I can't tell you how many objects \n                 of mine have been destroyed.  They told \n                 too much about me.  And if someone wants \n                 to know something about me...I'll tell \n                 them myself.  The way I'm telling you.\n\n       She looks back at him.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 What I do I do only for the objects.\n\n                           ZED\n                 I'd like to see one of these.\n\n                           ZOEY\n                 What?  So you could see the work of a \n                 whore?\n\n       He decides to put a stop to this once and for all.\n\n                           ZED\n                 Zoey.
