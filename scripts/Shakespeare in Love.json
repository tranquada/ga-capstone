North of the city was the Curtain Theatre, \n       home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage. \n       Across the river was the competition, built by Philip \n       Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...\n\n       ...The Rose...\n\n       Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-\n       tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor, \n       roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It \n       says:\n\n       SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON\n\n       MR.

HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned \n       in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of \n       a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that \n       position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN, \n       who is the owner of the VOICE.

WILL'S ROOM. DAY\n\n       A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A \n       cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged \n       between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have \n       time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM \n       STRATFORD-UPON-AVON. \n\n       At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper \n       are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing \n       them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing \n       studiously with a quill. \n\n       Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his \n       signature, over and over again. \"Will Shagsbeard\u0085W \n       Shakspur\u0085William Shasper\u0085\" Each time he is dissatisfied, \n       and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. \n\n       Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to \n       the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts \n       to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and \n       HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Will! Where is my play? Tell me you \n                 have it nearly done!

We are behind closed \n       curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the \n       imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is \n       not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. \n\n       RICHARD BURBAGE is to play \"PROTEUS.\" A BOY PLAYER will \n       play \"SILVIA,\" and last minute improvements to his makeup \n       etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE. \n       \"LAUNCE,\" one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL \n       KEMPE. \"LAUNCE'S\" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is \n       not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard \n       reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS \n       can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other \n       side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE \n       leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of \n       proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his \n       elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull\u0085in other words \n       he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of \n       WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.\n\n                           WILL\n                     (approaching)\n                 Prithee, Mr. Kempe, break a leg.

When will you write me a \n                 tragedy, Will? I could do it.\n\n                           WILL\n                 No, they would laugh at Seneca if you \n                 played it.\n\n       WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S \n       mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-\n       haired, sexual.\n\n                           BURBAGE\n                     (to ROSALINE)\n                 My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress \n                 Rosaline, where were my seamstress's \n                 eyes?\n\n       BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind.

The hubbub falls \n       silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS \n       know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and \n       find places to peep through.\n\n       INT.

DAY.\n\n       THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.\n\n       The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to \n       take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill \n       is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her \n       seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the \n       QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience \n       an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound. \n\n       Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing \"W. \n       Shakespeare.\" WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips \n       it into the mouth of the snake bangle. \n\n       The curtain draws back and CONDELL as \"VALENTINE\" and \n       BURBAGE as \"PROTEUS\" begin the play.\n\n                           CONDELL AS VALENTINE\n                 \"Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus; \n                 Home-keeping youth have ever homely \n                 wits\u0085\"\n\n       INT.

Then they kiss again, \n       but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the \n       auditorium.\n\n                           WILL\n                 You see?

Now he has \n       his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his \n       hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down, \n       picks up his pen, and stares in front of him.

For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon \n       gives away to something else. He is captivated.

DAY.\n\n       WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing \n       with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins, \n       tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews \n       (lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time \n       before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded \n       street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.\n\n       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.\n\n       When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in \n       a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The \n       river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a \n       number of waiting \"taxis.\" WILL jumps into the nearest \n       one and shouts at the \"Taxi Driver\" BOATMAN.\n\n                           WILL\n                 Follow that boat!\n\n                           BOATMAN\n                 Right you are, governor!\n\n       WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits \n       facing him, rowing lustily.\n\n                           BOATMAN (CONT'D)\n                 I know your face.

WILL is looking ahead to \n       where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther \n       shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the \n       north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run \n       toward the house.\n\n                           WILL\n                 Do you know that house?\n\n                           BOATMAN\n                 Sir Robert De Lesseps.\n\n       EXT.

What business here?\n\n                           MUSICIAN\n                 A five shilling business, Will. We \n                 play for the dancing.\n\n       The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a \n       GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who \n       have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the \n       house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX \n       skid to a halt and enter the house.\n\n       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.\n\n       WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he \n       strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests \n       are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances \n       around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing \n       SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.\n\n                           SERVANT\n                 Musicians don't eat, Sir Robert's \n                 orders.\n\n                           WILL\n                 I seek Master Thomas Kent.\n\n       It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON \n       WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.\n\n                           SIR ROBERT\n                 She is a beauty, my lord, as would \n                 take a king to church for a dowry of a \n                 nutmeg.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 My plantations in Virginia are not \n                 mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an \n                 ancient name that will bring you \n                 preferment when your grandson is a \n                 Wessex. Is she fertile?\n\n                           SIR ROBERT\n                 She will breed. If she do not, send \n                 her back.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Is she obedient?\n\n                           SIR ROBERT\n                 As any mule in Christendom. But if you \n                 are the man to rider her, their are \n                 rubies in the saddlebag.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 I like her.\n\n       ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in \n       the crowd. He turns to blood. \n       Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not \n       seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her \n       parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-\n       partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO \n       and JULIET).\n\n                           WILL\n                     (to Musician)\n                 By all the stars in heaven, who is \n                 she?\n\n                           MUSICIAN\n                 Viola de Lesseps. Dream on, Will.\n\n       WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to \n       keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA \n       moves through patterns of the dance until\u0085as night \n       follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has \n       insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Master Shakespeare\n\n       WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance \n       separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 My lady Viola.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 My lord.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 I have spoken with your father.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 So my lord? I speak with him every \n                 day.\n\n       WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds \n       herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her \n       entranced.\n\n                           VIOLA (CONT'D)\n                 Good sir\u0085 ?\n\n       WILL has lost his tongue.\n\n                           VIOLA (CONT'D)\n                 I heard you are a poet.\n\n       WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.\n\n                           VIOLA (CONT'D)\n                 But a poet of no words?\n\n       WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He \n       is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably \n       by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                     (smiling evilly)\n                 \"Poet?\"\n\n                           WILL\n                     (coming round form the \n                      anaesthetic and not noticing \n                      the danger)\n                 I was a poet till now, but I have seen \n                 beauty that puts my poems at one with \n                 the talking ravens at the Tower.\n\n       To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                     (startled)\n                 How do I offend, my lord?\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 By coveting my property. I cannot shed \n                 blood in her house but I will cut your \n                 throat anon. You have a name?\n\n                           WILL\n                     (gulps)\n                 Christopher Marlowe at your service.\n\n       WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.\n\n       VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds \n       WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.\n\n       EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT\n\n       There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed \n       for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space. \n       WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room \n       is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto \n       the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her. \n       VIOLA sighs dreamily.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Romeo, Romeo . . . a young man of \n                 Verona. A comedy. By William \n                 Shakespeare.\n\n       WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of \n       hiding, and approaches the balcony.\n\n                           WILL\n                     (whispers)\n                 My lady!\n\n                           VIOLA\n                     (gasps)\n                 Who is there?\n\n                           WILL\n                 Will Shakespeare!\n\n       The NURSE calls \"Madam!\" from inside the room.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Anon, good nurse.

WILL comes forward again.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                 Oh my lady, my love!\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 If they find you here they will kill \n                 you.\n\n                           WILL\n                 You can bring them with a word.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Oh, not for the world!\n\n       The NURSE calls her again: \"Madam!\"\n\n                           VIOLA (CONT'D)\n                 Anon, nurse!\n\n       But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that \n       there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb \n       up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a \n       soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops \n       his head over the parapet and is face to face with the \n       NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the \n       tree.\n\n       EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.\n\n       Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle \n       flames appear in different windows, the garden door is \n       flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one \n       hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top \n       of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He \n       could have written it better.\n\n       INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.\n\n       WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and \n       metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen \n       sheets. He is inspired.\n\n       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.\n\n       It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing \n       pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are \n       looking through their pages.\n\n                           JOHN\n                 \"Draw if you be men!\n                     (to JAMES)\n                 Gregory, remember thy washing blow.\"\n\n                           NOL\n                 \"Part, fools, put up your swords.\"\n\n       WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping \n       shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading \n       his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 It starts well, and then it's all long-\n                 faced about some Rosaline. Where's the \n                 comedy, Will. Where's the dog?\n                     (to RALPH)\n                 Do you think it is funny?\n\n                           RALPH\n                 I was a Pirate King, now I'm a Nurse. \n                 That's funny\n\n       WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.\n\n                           WILL\n                 We are at least six men short, and \n                 those we have will be overparted, \n                 ranters and stutterers who should be \n                 sent back to the stews. My Romeo has \n                 let me down. I see disaster.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 We are at least four acts short, Will, \n                 if you are looking for disaster.\n\n       WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor, \n       the URCHIN we met before.\n\n                           WILL\n                 Who are you, master?\n\n                           URCHIN\n                 I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's \n                 daughter.\n\n                           WILL\n                     (furiously)\n                 I'll be damned if you are!\n\n       And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN \n       glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to \n       face with FENNYMAN.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Is it going well?\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Very well.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 But nothing is happening.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Yes, but very well.\n\n                           WILL\n                     (shouts)\n                 Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Who is that?\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Nobody. The author.\n\n                           WILL\n                 We are about to embark on a great \n                 voyage.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 It is customary to make a little \n                 speech on the first day. It does no \n                 harm and authors like it.\n\n                           WILL\n                 You want to know what parts you are to \n                 receive. All will be settled as we go\n\n       That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic \n       interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and \n       SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the \n       actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big \n       voice and a big sword.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 Huzzah! The Admiral's Men are returned \n                 to the house!\n\n       He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his \n       name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the \n       new group and behave accordingly, others know they are \n       out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Who is this?\n\n       ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                     (roars)\n                 Silence, you god!

What \n                 is the play, and what is my part?\n\n       FENNYMAN is impressed.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 A moment, sir!\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                     (roars)\n                 Who are you?\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                     (bleating)\n                 I am the money!\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 Then you may remain so long as you \n                 remain silent.

NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an \n       argument.\n\n                           WILL\n                     (preempting)\n                 You did not like the speech?\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 The speech is excellent.\n                     (he does the first line \n                      impressively)\n                 \"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been \n                 with you!\" Excellent and a good \n                 length. But then he disappears for the \n                 length of a bible.\n\n       WILL points significantly at the pages he has given \n       PETER.\n\n                           WILL\n                 There you have his duel, a skirmish of \n                 words and swords such as I never \n                 wrote, nor anyone. He dies with such \n                 passion and poetry as your ever heard: \n                 \"a plague on both your houses!\"\n\n       NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns \n       back.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 He dies?\n\n       But the author has escaped.\n\n       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.\n\n       Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down \n       to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round \n       in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the \n       floor. That done, he picks up his pen.\n\n       EXT. STREET. NIGHT.\n\n       WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into \n       BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.\n\n                           BURBAGE\n                 Will!\n\n       WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop.

THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.\n\n       WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open \n       the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He \n       collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.\n\n                           WILL\n                 Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings!

The \n       BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore \n       him.\n\n                           WILL\n                 She tells me to keep away.

For what lady \n                 could live up to it close to, when her \n                 eyes and lips and voice may be no more \n                 beautiful than mine?

He holds her \n       round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her. \n       The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth \n       and jumps out of the boat.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Oh, Will!\n\n       She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the \n       house.\n\n                           BOATMAN\n                 Thank you, my lady!\n\n                           WILL\n                     (stunned)\n                 Lady?\n\n                           BOATMAN\n                 Viola De Lesseps.

STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE. \n       DAY.\n\n       We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as \"MERCUTIO\" and \n       NOL as \"BENVOLIO\", and two \"MONTAGUE\" sidekicks are in \n       occupation of the stage, when the \"CAPULETS\" swagger in, \n       four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as \"TYBALT.\"\n\n                           NOL AS BENVOLIO\n                 \"By my head, here comes the Capulets.\"\n\n                           ALLEYN AS MERCUTIO\n                 \"By my heel, I care not.\"\n\n                           JAMES HEMMINGS AS TYBALT\n                 \"Follow me close, for I will speak to \n                 them.

And \n                 before the humbled actor can reply NED \n                 continues.\n\n                           ALLEYN (AS MECUTIO)\n                 And but one word with one of us? \n                 Couple it with something, make it a \n                 word and a blow.\n\n       But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage, \n       ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have \n       arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs, \n       and a bucket (containing pig swill).\n\n                           BURBAGE\n                 Where is that thieving hack who can't \n                 keep his pen in his own ink pot!?\n\n       WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.\n\n                           WILL\n                 What is this rabble?!\n\n       BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave \n       from the nearest actor, and parries the blow. \n       He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL, \n       THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings \n       bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S \n       MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed \n       skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using \n       everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is \n       yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE, \n       a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the \n       page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up, \n       watches enthralled.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                     (to HENSLOWE)\n                 Wonderful, wonderful! And a dog!\n\n       But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't \n       belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his \n       interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is \n       using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one \n       of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Not with my props!\n\n       VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a \n       well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow \n       aimed at WILL\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Will! What--?\n\n                           WILL\n                 A literary feud. Quite normal.\n\n       Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage \n       taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known \n       as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                 Stay hid!\n\n       He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are \n       worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined, \n       with SAM GOSSE, dressed as \"JULIET,\" fighting with the \n       best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for \n       the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED \n       ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon \n       cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying \n       feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head \n       pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs \n       and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and \n       half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover \n       blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just \n       nicely for Will to plummet down it.\n\n       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.\n\n                           WILL\n                 I dreamed last night of a shipwreck. \n                 You were cast ashore in a far country.\n\n       They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of \n       their own.\n\n       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.\n\n       The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, \n       continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's \n       ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd \n       props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks \n       up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 We need that for the balcony scene!\n\n       FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He \n       looks around the realises that some of these faces are \n       unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. \n       FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.\n\n                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)\n                     (in despair)\n                 My poor Rose!\n\n       He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to \n       him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults \n       them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that \n       this scene is not in them.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                     (horrified)\n                 My investment! LAMBERT!!!\n\n       LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but \n       wakes to his master's call.\n\n                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)\n                     (points at the fray)\n                 VENGEANCE!\n\n       HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. \n                 As I explained to you, the theatre \n                 business\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my \n                 business I would be out of business if \n                 I had your courage, so don't tell me \n                 about business\n\n       And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S \n       MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is \n       making short work of the rest of the opposition, \n       receiving help with the thorny business of identification \n       from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are \n       running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic \n       last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage \n       and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts \n       applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start \n       applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN \n       looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and \n       bravos engulf him. A star!\n\n       INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.\n\n       The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel, \n       FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is \n       already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS.

He looks at her, helplessly, then \n       makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him \n       and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears. \n       VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street. \n       WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the \n       shoulders by PETER\u0085who, we now see, is in a highly \n       emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER \n       has the strength of the news he brings.\n\n                           PETER\n                     (shouts)\n                 Will! Mr. Henslowe!

Stabbed to death in a tavern \n                 at Deptford!\n\n       No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is \n       worse than the first.

God forgive \n                 me, God forgive me!\n\n       He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water \n       and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.\n\n       EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.\n\n       A church tower looms up in the night sky.\n\n       INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.\n\n       This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for \n       the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, \n       praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private \n       purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by \n       effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is \n       wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.\n\n       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.\n\n       A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. \n       VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides \n       sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather \n       like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive \n       animal. \n\n       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a \n       happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. \n       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA \n       and greets her merrily.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 You look sad, my lady! Let me take you \n                 riding.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 It is not my riding day, my lord.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Bless me, I thought it was a horse.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 I am going to church.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                     (recomposing his features to \n                      solemnity)\n                 I understand of course. It is to be \n                 expected.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 It is to be expected on a Sunday.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 And on a day of mourning. I never met \n                 the fellow but once at your house.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                     (cannot take this in)\n                 Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would \n                 be me to tell you. A great loss to \n                 playwriting, and to dancing.\n\n       VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                     (faintly)\n                 He is dead?\n\n                           WESSEX\n                     (cheerfully solemn)\n                 Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, \n                 then, we'll say a prayer for his soul\n\n       VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in \n       distress.\n\n                           NURSE\n                 My lady\u0085my lady\u0085now is the time to \n                 show your breeding.\n\n       INT. CHURCH. DAY.\n\n       The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. \n       VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat \n       and sits down next to her. \n\n       As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is \n       sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. \n       He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns \n       him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.\n\n       ANGLE on WILL. \n\n       WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great \n       shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of \n       times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has \n       banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he \n       stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. \n\n       WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering \n       accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to \n       mumble.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for \n                 the love of Christ!\n\n       Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at \n       first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment \n       as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally \n       running in terror.\n\n                           WESSEX (CONT'D)\n                     (screaming)\n                 Spare me!\n\n       The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA \n       to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is \n       leaving.\n\n       EXT. CHURCH. DAY.\n\n       Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the \n       church. She calls his name.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Will!\n\n       He does not answer. She runs after him.\n\n                           VIOLA (CONT'D)\n                 Oh, my love, I thought you were dead!\n\n       She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment \n       then WILL pulls back.\n\n                           WILL\n                 It is worse. I have killed a man.\n\n       EXT. MEADOW. DAY.\n\n       VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still \n       sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among \n       the buttercups and looks down at him. \n       VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She \n       has not yet revealed her feelings.\n\n                           WILL\n                 Marlowe's touch was in my Titus \n                 Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house \n                 built on his foundations.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 You never spoke so well of him.\n\n                           WILL\n                 He was not dead before.

Will?\n\n                           WILL\n                 You, Edward. The Friar who married \n                 them gives Juliet a potion to drink. \n                 It is a secret potion. It makes her \n                 seeming dead. She is placed in the \n                 tomb of the Capulets. She will awake \n                 to life and love when Romeo comes to \n                 her side again.\n\n       THE COMPANY murmurs approval.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                 I have not said all. By malign fate, \n                 the message goes astray which would \n                 tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He \n                 hears only that Juliet is dead. And \n                 thus he goes to the Apothecary.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 That's me.\n\n                           WILL\n                 And buys a deadly poison. He enters \n                 the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who \n                 lies there cold as death. He drinks \n                 the poison. He dies by her side. And \n                 then she wakes and sees him dead.\n\n       HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                 And so Juliet takes his dagger and \n                 kills herself.\n\n       PAUSE.\n\n       WILL is staring at VIOLA\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Well, that will have them rolling in \n                 the aisles.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Sad and wonderful! I have a blue \n                 velvet cap which will do well, I have \n                 seen apothecary with a cap just so.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                     (to WILL)\n                 Yes--it will serve. But there's a scene \n                 missing between marriage and death.\n\n       WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the \n       others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head. \n       WILL looks at NED.\n\n       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.\n\n       WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present \n       for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on \n       sheets folded to octavo size.\n\n                           WILL\n                 The play. All written out for you.

DAY.\n\n       But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as \n       \"THOMAS.\" Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a \n       deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc., \n       they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether \n       it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it \n       is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming \n       away, their words interrupted by kisses.\n\n                           WILL\n                 \"\u0085thou need'st not to be gone.\"\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 \"I have more care to stay than will to \n                 go.

Tilney \n                 walks away.\n\n       EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.\n\n       A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is \n       muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is \n       FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary, \n       for which he has a special voice.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 \"Such mortal drugs I have but Mantua's \n                 law Is death to any he that utters \n                 them.\" Then him.

What is it?\n\n       He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not \n       notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance \n       dismounts and walks inside.\n\n       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.\n\n       Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in. \n       Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actors\u0085and JOHN \n       WEBSTER\u0085who sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.\n\n                           WEBSTER\n                 My lord!\n\n       WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                     (shouts)\n                 Shakespeare!\n\n       Everything stops.\n\n                           WESSEX (CONT'D)\n                 You upstart inky pup!

She almost gives herself away. But the \n       fight has started. \n\n       WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He \n       parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes \n       fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts \n       accurately at WESSEX'S chest\u0085and would have killed him \n       but for the button on his sword-point. \n\n       WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of \n       the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the \n       ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own \n       safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the \n       fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy. \n\n       WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody \n       staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.\n\n                           WILL (CONT'D)\n                 Absent friends!\n                     (to the assembly)\n                 This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!\n\n       NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 Will\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 I rejoiced at his death because I \n                 thought it was yours. That is all I \n                 know of Marlowe.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 It's true, Will--it was a tavern \n                 brawl\u0085Marlowe attacked, and got his \n                 own knife in the eye.

For \n                 displaying a female on the public \n                 stage!\n\n       TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stage\u0085and seizes \n       SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY \n       pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell \n       of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers. \n\n       TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER \n       rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly \n       throws one of his mice onto \"ROMEO'S\" hair. VIOLA gives a \n       shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via \n       VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which \n       time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her \n       hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. \n       WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible \n       despair and apology.\n\n                           WEBSTER\n                     (pointing at SAM)\n                 Not him.\n                     (pointing at VIOLA)\n                 her.\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 He's a woman!\n\n       By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so \n       it seems.\n\n                           TILNEY\n                 That's who I meant! This theatre is \n                 closed!

Closed, mark you, Henslowe!\n\n       TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph.

VIOLA walks \n       away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her \n       go, watching her silently.

He starts off \n       towards her\u0085but his progress is halted by a sock to the \n       jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust. \n       FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper, \n       mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the \n       groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole \n       COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or \n       worse.

She \n       is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Juliet\u0085and \n       rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the \n       NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts \n       the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and \n       raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing. \n\n       She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be \n       said.\n\n       INT. TAVERN. DAY.\n\n       They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and \n       HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk. \n       FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat \n       selfishly.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                     (muttering)\n                 I would have been good\u0085I would have \n                 been great.\n\n       He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.\n\n                           RALPH\n                 So would I. We both would.\n\n       RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not \n       working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over, \n       rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE \n       enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the \n       CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes \n       and bandages round their heads.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                     (shouts)\n                 Lambert!\n\n       LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his \n       tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and \n       tables out of his way.\n\n                           FENNYMAN (CONT'D)\n                 Kill him!\n\n       LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes \n       down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a \n       battle-axe. \n\n       But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash. \n       BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame, \n       LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand. \n       BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is \n       half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces \n       BURBAGE.\n\n                           ALLEYN\n                 Well, Burbage--you never did know when \n                 your scene was over.\n\n                           BURBAGE\n                 That can wait. The Master of the \n                 Revels despises us for vagrants, \n                 tinkers, and peddlers of bombast. But \n                 my father, James Burbage, had the \n                 first licence to make a company of \n                 players from Her Majesty, and he drew \n                 from poets the literature of the age. \n                 Their fame will be our fame. So let \n                 them all know, we are men of parts. We \n                 are a brotherhood, and we will be a \n                 profession. Will Shakespeare has a \n                 play. I have a theatre. The Curtain is \n                 yours.\n\n       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.\n\n       A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a \n       paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble \n       pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of \n       wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen \n       flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot \n       runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at \n       the poster. It says\n\n                           BY PERMISSION OF\n                 MR.

He \n       walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:\n\n                           HENSLOWE\n                 Will!\n\n       WILL does not turn to look at him.\n\n                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)\n                 We'll be needing a Romeo\n\n       WILL carries on walking.\n\n       EXT. STREETS. DAY.\n\n       WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the \n       river.\n\n       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.\n\n       The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress. \n       The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task \n       impassively.\n\n       EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.\n\n       WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.\n\n       INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY.\n\n       WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his \n       negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS \n       weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money \n       chest, too.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 My ship is moored at Bankside, bound \n                 for Virginia on the afternoon \n                 tide--please do not weep, Lady De \n                 Lesseps, you are gaining a colony.\n\n                           DE LESSEPS\n                 And you are gaining five thousand \n                 pounds, my lord\u0085by these drafts in my \n                 hand.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Would you oblige me with fifty or so \n                 in gold?--just to settle my accounts at \n                 the dockside?\n\n       DE LESSEPS sighs and unlocks his money chest. WESSEX \n       places his empty purse on the desk.\n\n                           WESSEX (CONT'D)\n                 Ah!--Look, she comes!\n\n       VIOLA has appeared at the top of the stairs with the \n       NURSE.\n\n                           VIOLA\n                 Good morning, my lord. I see you are \n                 open for business so let's to church.\n\n       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.\n\n       WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he \n       crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down \n       on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of \n       the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and \n       his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the \n       carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal\n\n       EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.\n\n       The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as \n       WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S \n       veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just \n       see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage \n       is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction. \n\n       Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer \n       from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at \n       it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to \n       VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes \n       it to the NURSE. \n\n       WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage \n       awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door \n       for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to \n       follow her.\n\n                           NURSE\n                 My lord!\n\n       The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S \n       discomfort.\n\n                           NURSE (CONT'D)\n                 Be good to her, my lord!\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 I will.\n\n       He tries to disengage. She won't have it.\n\n                           NURSE\n                 God bless you!\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Thank you. Let go, there's a good \n                 nurse.\n\n       After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates \n       himself.\n\n                           WESSEX (CONT'D)\n                 The tide will not wait. Farewell!\n\n       WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.\n\n       INT. CARRIAGE. DAY.\n\n       It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in \n       there. He looks around but VIOLA has fled.\n\n       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.\n\n       Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among \n       them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the \n       crowds to run away from sin\n\n                           MAKEPEACE\n                 Licentiousness is made a show, vice is \n                 made a show, vanity and pride likewise \n                 made a show! This is the very business \n                 of show\n\n       But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the \n       main doors of the theatre.\n\n       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.\n\n       The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz \n       of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for \"MERCUTIO,\" is \n       giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN \n       HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance. \n       FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his \n       lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his \n       dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for\n\n                           \"ROMEO.\"\n                 FENNYMAN approaches him, apothecary's \n                 cap in hand.\n\n                           FENNYMAN\n                 Is this all right?\n\n       WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He \n       is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.\n\n       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.\n\n       The audience is gathering.\n\n       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.\n\n       Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They \n       arrive by carriage and by palanquin. \n       Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito. \n       A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the \n       ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.\n\n       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. ENTRANCE. DAY.\n\n       LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.\n\n       INT.

DAY.\n\n       Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets \n       and drums sound. The house falls silent.\n\n       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.\n\n       WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have \n       never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering \n       lines and stuttering them.\n\n                           WABASH\n                     (mutter)\n                 T-t-t-two h-h-households b-both alike \n                 in d-d-d-dignity.\n\n       WILL listens to him in agony.

A shaft \n       of sunlight hits her.\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 Have a care with my name, you will \n                 wear it out.\n\n       There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and \n       actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN \n       ELIZABETH takes the limelight.\n\n                           QUEEN (CONT'D)\n                 The Queen of England does not attend \n                 exhibitions of public lewdness so \n                 something is out of joint. Come here, \n                 Master Kent. Let me look at you.\n\n       VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she \n       catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests \n       the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.\n\n                           QUEEN (CONT'D)\n                 Yes, the illusion is remarkable and \n                 your error, Mr. Tilney, easily \n                 forgiven, but I know something of a \n                 woman in a man's profession, yes, by \n                 God, I do know about that. That is \n                 enough from you, Maser Kent. If only \n                 Lord Wessex were here.\n\n                           VOICE\n                 He is, Ma'am.\n\n       The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a \n       figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look \n       inconspicuous.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                     (weakly)\n                 Your Majesty\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 There was a wager, I remember\u0085as to \n                 whether a play can show the very truth \n                 and nature of love. I think you lost \n                 it today.\n                     (turning to WEBSTER)\n                 You are an eager boy. Did you like the \n                 play?\n\n                           WEBSTER\n                 I liked it when she stabbed herself, \n                 your Majesty.\n\n       The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 Master Shakespeare. Next time to you \n                 come to Greenwich, Come as yourself \n                 and we will speak some more. WILL bows \n                 deeply. The QUEEN turns to leave. The \n                 waves part for her.\n\n       INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY.\n\n       The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.\n\n       EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.\n\n       A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her \n       carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase \n       as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the \n       following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking \n       place, including some of the actors crowding to see her \n       off. WESSEX bows out of breath.\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Your Majesty!\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 Why, Lord Wessex! Lost your wife so \n                 soon?\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Indeed I am a bride short. How is this \n                 to end?\n\n       VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the \n       other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 As stories must when love's \n                 denied--with tears and a journey. Those \n                 whom God has joined in marriage, not \n                 even I can put asunder.\n\n                           QUEEN (CONT'D)\n                     (she turns to VIOLA)\n                 Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost \n                 his wife in the play- house--go make \n                 your farewell and send her out. It's \n                 time to settle accounts.\n                     (to WESSEX)\n                 How much was the wager?\n\n                           WESSEX\n                 Fifty shillings.\n                     (the QUEEN gives him a look)\n                 Pounds.\n\n                           QUEEN\n                 Give it to Master Kent. He will see it \n                 rightfully home. WESSEX gives his \n                 purse to VIOLA.\n\n                           QUEEN (CONT'D)\n                     (to VIOLA)\n                 And tell Shakespeare something more \n                 cheerful next time for Twelfth Night.\n\n       The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an \n       enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN \n       hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the \n       puddle as cloaks descend upon it.\n\n                           QUEEN (CONT'D)\n                 Too late, too late.\n\n       She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.\n\n       INT.
