The man who is throwing \n       them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing \n       studiously with a quill. \n\n       Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his \n       signature, over and over again. \"Will Shagsbeard\u0085W \n       Shakspur\u0085William Shasper\u0085\" Each time he is dissatisfied, \n       and each time he crumples, and tosses it away. \n\n       Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to \n       the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts \n       to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and \n       HENSLOWE walks in.

NIGHT.\n</b>\n       The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about, \n       chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while \n       QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes \n       through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with \n       a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the \n       best chair\u0085where she establishes a headquarters. Her \n       current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to \n       a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the \n       next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and \n       bowing as they are greeted by people who know them\u0085Will, \n       in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until \n       VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The \n       QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.\n\n<b>                           WESSEX\n</b>                     (to him)\n                 Now?\n\n<b>                           LORD IN WAITING\n</b>                 Now.\n\n<b>                           WESSEX\n</b>                     (to Viola)\n                 The Queen asks for you.

In a moment they are in a world of \n       their own.\n\n<b>       INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.\n</b>\n       The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium, \n       continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's \n       ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd \n       props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks \n       up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.\n\n<b>                           HENSLOWE\n</b>                 We need that for the balcony scene!\n\n       FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He \n       looks around the realises that some of these faces are \n       unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head. \n       FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.\n\n<b>                           HENSLOWE (CONT'D)\n</b>                     (in despair)\n                 My poor Rose!\n\n       He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to \n       him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults \n       them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that \n       this scene is not in them.\n\n<b>                           FENNYMAN\n</b>                     (horrified)\n                 My investment!

LAMBERT meanwhile is \n       making short work of the rest of the opposition, \n       receiving help with the thorny business of identification \n       from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are \n       running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic \n       last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage \n       and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts \n       applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start \n       applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN \n       looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and \n       bravos engulf him. A star!\n\n<b>       INT. BROTHEL.

The church is empty, but for \n       the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling, \n       praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private \n       purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by \n       effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is \n       wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.\n\n<b>       EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.\n</b>\n       A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing. \n       VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides \n       sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather \n       like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive \n       animal. \n\n       Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a \n       happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily. \n       Here is a man who has heard wonderful news.

CHURCH. DAY.\n</b>\n       The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church. \n       VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat \n       and sits down next to her. \n\n       As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is \n       sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest. \n       He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns \n       him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.\n\n       ANGLE on WILL. \n\n       WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great \n       shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of \n       times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has \n       banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he \n       stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX. \n\n       WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering \n       accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to \n       mumble.\n\n<b>                           WESSEX\n</b>                 Oh, spare me, dear ghost, spare me for \n                 the love of Christ!\n\n       Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at \n       first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment \n       as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally \n       running in terror.\n\n<b>                           WESSEX (CONT'D)\n</b>                     (screaming)\n                 Spare me!\n\n       The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA \n       to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is \n       leaving.\n\n<b>       EXT. CHURCH. DAY.\n</b>\n       Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the \n       church. She calls his name.\n\n<b>                           VIOLA\n</b>                 Will!\n\n       He does not answer.

Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY \n       pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell \n       of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers. \n\n       TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER \n       rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly \n       throws one of his mice onto \"ROMEO'S\" hair. VIOLA gives a \n       shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via \n       VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which \n       time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her \n       hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender. \n       WILL is paralysed.
