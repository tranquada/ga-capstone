PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT\n\n\tAbove Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a \n\thot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and \n\tits drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes. \n\tWe fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over \n\ttraffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business \n\tbuildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we \n\tapproach downtown section, the character of the city begins \n\tto change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We \n\tsee railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-\n\tvegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.  \n\tvegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of \n\tnefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.\n\n\tWe fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific \n\tlocation. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its \n\texposed brick side great painted letters advertise \"Transients-\n\tLow Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room.\" We pause long enough \n\tto establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open, \n\tcurtainless windows, its silent resigned look so \n\tcharacteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward \n\twith purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is \n\traised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to \n\tthree or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants \n\tof the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are \n\tclose now, so that only the lower half of the window frame \n\tis in shot. No sounds come from within the room.\n\n\tSuddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between \n\tshade and sill, peep into the room.\n\n\tA young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears \n\ta full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude \n\tof physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of \n\tthe room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome \n\tconflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl \n\tnearing the end of her twenties and her rope.\n\n\tA man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure \n\tvisible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then \n\tstart forward. As we pass under the window shade,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)\n\n\tA small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow \n\tbed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the \n\tbureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-\n\ttop handbag are on the bureau.\n\n\tOn the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-\n\tCola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There \n\tis no radio.\n\n\tThe man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt \n\tand sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man \n\twith warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting \n\this neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at \n\tMary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps \n\ther face turned away from him.\n\n\tAfter a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans \n\tover and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly, \n\tholds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed \n\tand finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an \n\tinconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow \n\tMary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns \n\tat her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate, \n\tplayful voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tNever did eat your lunch, did you.\n\n\tMary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, \n\tkisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings \n\ther legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds \n\ther shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally \n\tpulls away and sits up.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI better get back to the office.  \n\t\tThese extended lunch hours give my \n\t\tboss excess acid.\n\n\tShe rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings \n\tout of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or \n\tperhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam \n\twatches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, \n\thumorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they \n\toccupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tCall your boss and tell him you're \n\t\ttaking the rest of the afternoon \n\t\toff. It's Friday anyway... and hot.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(soft sarcasm)\n\t\tWhat do I do with my free afternoon, \n\t\twalk you to the airport?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(meaningfully)\n\t\tWe could laze around here a while \n\t\tlonger.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tChecking out time is three P.M. Hotels \n\t\tof this sort aren't interested in \n\t\tyou when you come in, but when your \n\t\ttime's up...\n\t\t\t(a small anguish)\n\t\tSam, I hate having to be with you in \n\t\ta place like this.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI've heard of married couples who \n\t\tdeliberately spend occasional nights \n\t\tin cheap hotels. They say it...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\tWhen you're married you can do a lot \n\t\tof things deliberately.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYou sure talk like a girl who's been \n\t\tmarried.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tSam!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI'm sorry, Mary.\n\t\t\t(after a moment)\n\t\tMy old Dad used to say 'when you \n\t\tcan't change a situation, laugh at \n\t\tit.' Nothing ridicules a thing like \n\t\tlaughing at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI've lost my girlish laughter.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(observing)\n\t\tThe only girlish thing you have lost.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(a meaningful quiet, \n\t\t\tthen, with difficulty:)\n\t\tSam. This is the last time.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tFor what?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tThis! Meeting you in secret so we \n\t\tcan be... secretive! You come down \n\t\there on business trips and we steal \n\t\tlunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't \n\t\teven come.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tOkay. What do we do instead, write \n\t\teach other lurid love letters?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(about to argue, then \n\t\t\tturning away)\n\t\tI haven't time to argue. I'm a working \n\t\tgirl.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd I'm a working man! We're a regular \n\t\tworking-class tragedy!\n\t\t\t(he laughs)\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tIt is tragic! Or it will be... if we \n\t\tgo on meeting in shabby hotels \n\t\twhenever you can find a tax-deductible \n\t\texcuse for flying down deductible \n\t\there...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(interrupting, \n\t\t\tseriously)\n\t\tYou can't laugh at it, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tCan you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tSure. It's like laughing through a \n\t\tbroken jaw, but...\n\n\tHe breaks off, his cheeriness dissolved, goes to the window, \n\ttries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.\n\n\tIt comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room, \n\trevealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if \n\tcorroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the \n\tfallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor \n\tagain.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd besides, when you say I make tax-\n\t\tdeductible excuses you make me out a \n\t\tcriminal.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(having to smile)\n\t\tYou couldn't be a criminal if you \n\t\tcommitted a major crime.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI wish I were. Not an active criminal \n\t\tbut... a nice guy with the conscience \n\t\tof a criminal.\n\t\t\t(goes close to mary, \n\t\t\ttouches her)\n\t\tNext best thing to no conscience at \n\t\tall.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(pulling away)\n\t\tI have to go, Sam.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI can come down next week.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tNot even just to see you, to have \n\t\tlunch... in public?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tWe can see each other, we can even \n\t\thave dinner... but respectably, in \n\t\tmy house with my mother's picture on \n\t\tthe mantel and my sister helping me \n\t\tbroil a big steak for three!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd after the steak... do we send \n\t\tSister to the movies and turn Mama's \n\t\tpicture to the wall?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tSam! No!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(after a pause, simply)\n\t\tAll right.\n\n\tShe stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue \n\tthe affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised \n\twhen they discover men will continue to want them even after \n\tthe sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, \n\tplaces his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and \n\tsimple sincerity.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tMary, whenever it's possible, tax-\n\t\tdeductible or not, I want to see \n\t\tdeductible you. And under any \n\t\tconditions.\n\t\t\t(a smile)\n\t\tEven respectability.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tYou make respectability sound...  \n\t\tdisrespectful.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(brightly)\n\t\tI'm all for it! It requires patience \n\t\tand temperance and a lot of sweating-\n\t\tout... otherwise, though, it's only \n\t\thard work.\n\t\t\t(a pause)\n\t\tBut if I can see you, touch you even \n\t\tas simply as this... I won't mind.\n\n\tHe moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems \n\tcrushes away his good humor. There is a quiet moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI'm fed up with sweating for people \n\t\twho aren't there. I sweat to pay off \n\t\tmy father's debts... and he's in his \n\t\tgrave... I sweat to pay my ex-wife \n\t\talimony, and she's living on the \n\t\tother side of the world somewhere.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(a smile)\n\t\tI pay, too. They also pay who meet \n\t\tin hotel rooms.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tA couple of years and the debts will \n\t\tbe paid off. And if she ever re-\n\t\tmarries, the alimony stops... and \n\t\tthen...\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI haven't even been married once \n\t\tyet!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYeah, but when you do... you'll swing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(smiling, then with a \n\t\t\tterrible urgency)\n\t\tSam, let's go get married.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd live with me in a storeroom behind \n\t\ta hardware store in Fairvale. We'll \n\t\thave a lot of laughs. When I send my \n\t\tex-wife her money, you can lick the \n\t\tstamps.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(a deep desperation)\n\t\tI'll lick the stamps.\n\n\tHe looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, \n\tlooks out the window and stares at the wide sky.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYou know what I'd like? A clear, \n\t\tempty sky... and a plane, and us in \n\t\tit... and somewhere a private island \n\t\tfor sale, where we can run around \n\t\twithout our... shoes on.  And the \n\t\twherewithal to buy what I'd like.\n\t\t\t(he moves away, \n\t\t\tsuddenly serious)\n\t\tMary, you want to cut this off, go \n\t\tout and find yourself someone \n\t\tavailable.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI'm thinking of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(a cheerful shout)\n\t\tHow can you even think a thing like \n\t\tthat!\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(picking up handbag, \n\t\t\tstarting for door)\n\t\tDon't miss your plane.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHey, we can leave together can't we?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(at door)\n\t\tI'm late... and you have to put your \n\t\tshoes on.\n\n\tMary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares \n\tdown at his shoeless feet,\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - (DAY) - HIGH ANGLE\n\n\tShooting down at hotel entrance. Mary comes out, walks quickly \n\tto a parked cab, gets in. The cab zooms up the awful street.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. LOWERY REAL ESTATE OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tA small, moderately successful office off the main street. A \n\tcab pulls up at the curb. We see Mary get out of cab, pay \n\tdriver, cross pavement to the office door.\n\n\tINT. OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tMary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her \n\ttemples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last \n\tof her teens.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tIsn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\t\t(a high, bright, eager-\n\t\t\tto-talk voice laced \n\t\t\tto-with a vague Texan \n\t\t\taccent)\n\t\tHe's lunching with the man who's \n\t\tbuying the Harris Street property, \n\t\tyou know, that oil lease man...  so \n\t\tthat's why he's late.\n\t\t\t(a pause, then, as \n\t\t\tMary does not respond \n\t\t\tto the pointed thrust)\n\t\tYou getting a headache?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tIt'll pass. Headaches are like \n\t\tresolutions... you forget them soon \n\t\tas they stop hurting.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\tYou got aspirins? I have something... \n\t\tnot aspirins, but\n\t\t\t(cheerfully takes \n\t\t\tbottle of pills out \n\t\t\tof desk drawer)\n\t\tmy mother's doctor gave these to me \n\t\tthe day of my wedding.\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tTeddy was furious when he found out \n\t\tI'd taken tranquilizers!\n\n\tShe rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tWere there any calls?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\tTeddy called.  Me... And my mother \n\t\tcalled to see if Teddy called. Oh, \n\t\tand your sister called to say she's \n\t\tgoing to Tucson to do some buying \n\t\tand she'll be gone the whole weekend \n\t\tand...\n\n\tShe breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. \n\tMR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the \n\toffice. Lowery is a pleasant, worried-faced man, big and a \n\ttrifle pompous. Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-\n\thour load on. He is a gross man, exuding a kind of pitiful \n\tvulgarity.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tWow! Hot as fresh milk! You girls \n\t\tshould get your boss to air-condition \n\t\tyou up. He can afford it today.\n\n\tLowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead \n\tCassidy toward the private office.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY\n\t\tMary, will you get those copies of \n\t\tthe deed ready for Mr. Cassidy.\n\n\tCassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the \n\tdesktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tTomorrow's the day! My sweet little \n\t\tgirl...\n\t\t\t(laughs as Mary looks \n\t\t\tup at him)\n\t\tNot you, my daughter!  A baby, and \n\t\ttomorrow she stands up there and \n\t\tgets her sweet self married away \n\t\tfrom me!\n\t\t\t(pulling out wallet)\n\t\tI want you to look at my baby.  \n\t\tEighteen years old... and she's never \n\t\thad an unhappy day in any one of \n\t\tthose years!\n\t\t\t(flashes photo)\n\n\tMary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some \n\tremark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore \n\tthe man's hot-breath closeness.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY\n\t\tCome on, Tom, my office is air-\n\t\tconditioned.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\t\t(ignoring Lowery)\n\t\tYou know what I do with unhappiness? \n\t\tI buy it off! You unhappy?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tNot inordinately.\n\t\t\t(puts deed copy into \n\t\t\tCassidy's too-close \n\t\t\thand)\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tI'm buying this house for my baby's \n\t\twedding present. Forty thousand \n\t\tdollars, cash! Now that ain't buying \n\t\thappiness, that's buying off \n\t\tunhappiness! That penniless punk \n\t\tshe's marryin'...\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tProbably a good kid... it's just \n\t\tthat I hate him.\n\t\t\t(looks at deed)\n\t\tYup! Forty thousand, says here...\n\t\t\t(to Lowery)\n\t\tCasharoonie!\n\n\tHe takes out of his inside pocket, two separate bundles of \n\tnew $100 bills and throws them onto the desk, under Mary's \n\tnose. Caroline's eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious \n\tgreen bundles of bills, and she comes close to the desk. \n\tCassidy leans terribly close to Mary, flicks through the \n\tbills, laughs wickedly.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tI never carry more than I can afford \n\t\tto lose!\n\t\t\t(closer to Mary)\n\t\tCount 'em!\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY\n\t\t\t(shocked, worried)\n\t\tTom... cash transactions of this \n\t\tsize! Most irregular...\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tSo what? It's my private money!\n\t\t\t(laughs, winks, elbows \n\t\t\tLowery)\n\t\tAnd now it's yours.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\t\t(staring at the money)\n\t\tI declare!\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\t\t(whispering)\n\t\tI don't! That's how I'm able to keep \n\t\tit!\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY\n\t\t\t(hastily interrupting)\n\t\tSuppose we just put this in the safe \n\t\tand then Monday morning when you're \n\t\tfeeling good...\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tSpeakin' of feeling good, where's \n\t\tthat bottle you said you had in your \n\t\tdesk...\n\t\t\t(laughs, as if having \n\t\t\tgiven away Lowery's \n\t\t\tsecret)\n\t\tOops!\n\t\t\t(to Mary, patting her \n\t\t\tarm)\n\t\tUsually I can keep my mouth shut!\n\n\tHe rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks \n\tto Mary, meaningfully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tHonest. I can keep any private \n\t\ttransaction a secret... any pri....\n\t\t\t(stopped by Mary's \n\t\t\tcold gaze)\n\t\tLowery! I'm dyin' of thirstaroonie!\n\n\tLowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has \n\tgone into Lower's office.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tI don't even want it in the office \n\t\tover the weekend. Put it in the safe \n\t\tdeposit box, at the bank, Mary. And \n\t\twe'll get him to give us a check on \n\t\tMonday - instead.\n\n\tHe starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going \n\tto come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men \n\tare gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, \n\tsmiles at it.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\tHe was flirting with you. I guess he \n\t\tnoticed my wedding ring.\n\n\tMary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the \n\tother from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the \n\tfilled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed \n\tcopies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office \n\tdoor, knocks, starts to open door as:\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY (O.S.)\n\t\tCome in.\n\n\tINT. LOWERY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tMary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large \n\ttumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary \n\tremains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, \n\ttalking as she goes.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tThe copies. Mr. Lowery, if you don't \n\t\tmind, I'd like to go right on home \n\t\tafter the bank. I have a slight...\n\n\t\t\t\tCASSIDY\n\t\tYou go right home!

OUTER OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tMary goes to her desk, takes the handbag, checks to make \n\tsure the money-filled envelope is tucked well down into it. \n\tDuring this:\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE\n\t\tAren't you going to take the pills?\n\t\t\t(as Mary shakes her \n\t\t\thead)\n\t\tThey'll knock that headache out.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI don't need pills... just sleep.\n\n\tShe goes to the door.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE:\n\n\tINT. MARY'S BEDROOM - (DAY)\n\n\tA double bed in the foreground. We just see the far side as \n\tthe CAMERA SHOOTS across. Mary enters the scene, clad only \n\tin her slip. Perhaps she is about to get into bed. Behind \n\ther is an open closet, but too dark inside for us to see any \n\tcontents. As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to \n\tshow a close view of the $40,000 in the envelope on our side \n\tof the bed.\n\n\tMary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on \n\tas the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed \n\tsuitcase also on the bed. Mary zips up her dress and then \n\tbrings some final garments from the closet.\n\n\tShe comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top. \n\tMary works with haste and in tension, as if acting on an \n\timpulse which might vanish as quickly as it came.\n\n\tThe suitcase filled now, she checks around the room, then \n\ttakes her handbag to the bed, puts in the money-filled \n\tenvelope, and then slams the suitcase shut. Then filled she \n\tlooks at her small bedroom desk, goes to it, removes a small \n\tfile-envelope from one of the drawers. It is one of those \n\tbrown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and \n\tpolicies and certificates. She checks its contents briefly, \n\tputs it on the bed, opens another desk drawer, takes out her \n\tbank book, tosses it on the bed. Then she packs both the \n\tfile-envelope and the bank book, into her handbag, takes one \n\tquick last look around the room, picks up the handbag and \n\tthe suitcase and goes out of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. MARY'S GARAGE - (DAY)\n\n\tA two-car garage. One car is gone. Mary's car is parked in \n\tthe driveway. The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily \n\tread the Arizona number plate in the foreground.\n\n\tMary comes out of house, starts for the trunk, intending to \n\tput the suitcase in, changes her mind, places the suitcase \n\tand her handbag on the front seat, gets in, starts the car, \n\tbegins to back out of driveway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\n\n\tWe are close on Mary's car, shooting in at her troubled, \n\tguilty face. She seems to be driving with that excess care \n\tof one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic \n\tirregularity. She stops for a red light at a main \n\tintersection.\n\n\tFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)\n\n\tWe see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street, passing right \n\tin front of Mary's car.\n\n\tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)\n\n\tMary freezes.\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\n\n\tCassidy, glancing into car, sees Mary, lets out a cheery \n\texclamation, elbows Lowery. Lowery turns, sees Mary, smiles \n\tpleasantly, pulls Cassidy on.\n\n\tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)\n\n\tMary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror \n\ton her face.\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\n\n\tNow we look closely at Lowery. As he reaches the curb, a \n\tsmall confusion brightens his face. He remembers that Mary \n\tintended to \"spend the weekend in bed.\" He considers, \n\tcuriously, turns, looks back at her, a slight frown on his \n\tface.\n\n\tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)\n\n\tMary sees the pause and the look.\n\n\tEXT. MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)\n\n\tFor a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to \n\tcross back to the car.\n\n\tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)\n\n\tMary's tension is unbearable. And at that moment we hear the \n\tshrill shriek of the traffic cop's whistle.\n\n\tMary zooms the car away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. HIGHWAY - (DAY)\n\n\tMary in car, driving, safely away from town. Her look is \n\tless tense now, and more purposeful. After a moment, she \n\tchecks the fuel gauge, frowns, looks along highway for a gas \n\tstation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FAST DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tMARY'S CAR - (DAY)\n\n\tApproaching and leaving city limits.\n\n\tMARY - (DAY)\n\n\tLooks at gas gauge.\n\n\tC.U. GAS GAUGE - (DAY)\n\n\tEXT. A GAS STATION - (DAY)\n\n\tWe see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no \n\tother cars about, this being a gas station off the main \n\thighway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary \n\tlooks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face \n\tturned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.\n\n\tNo one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as \n\tif the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that \n\tshe should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty. \n\tShe has to blow her horn.\n\n\tA YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.\n\n\tAt that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the \n\tshack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's \n\tcar, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's \n\tinsistent ringing unnerves Mary.\n\n\tShe starts her car, zooms off.\n\n\tWe see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack. \n\tHe looks after the departing car with little or no expression.\n\n\tCAR\n\n\tThe car grows smaller as it races up the road. The sun is \n\tsetting. There is something vaguely ominous about the \n\tdarkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tMARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)\n\n\tThe oncoming headlights hurt Mary's eyes. She is getting \n\tsleepy and her vision is blurring. Her eyes close, \n\tinvoluntarily, snap open again. She stretches than wide, as \n\tif forcing them to stay open. The oncoming lights seem to \n\tglare to a point beyond endurance. She murmurs \"Sam - Sam.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLONG LAP DISSOLVE:\n\n\tEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)\n\n\tWe see Mary's car, dim in the early dawn, tilted on the soft \n\tshoulder of the road, looking somehow sad and pathetic, like \n\ta child's thrown-away toy. And from this angle it would appear \n\tthat the car is empty.\n\n\tAfter a moment, during which there are no other vehicles \n\tpassing, we see, coming from the far distance, a HIGHWAY \n\tPATROLMAN in a patrol car. He passes Mary's car, notes its \n\tapparent emptiness, U-turns, comes back up behind the car. \n\tHe gets out and approaches the driver's side window.\n\n\tEXT. MARY'S CAR - (DAWN)\n\n\tThe Patrolman looks down into the car.\n\n\tINT. CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPOINT\n\n\tMary turns with a start, sits up, is startled and unnerved \n\tby the sight of the Patrolman, and, as if by automatic reflex, \n\tturns the ignition and presses down on the starter.\n\n\tEXT.

He calls:\n\n\t\t\t\tPATROLMAN\n\t\tWait a minute!\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(jamming down the \n\t\t\tbrake)\n\t\tNow what?\n\n\tThe Patrolman gazes at her a moment, then:\n\n\t\t\t\tPATROLMAN\n\t\tMay I see your license?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tWhy?\n\n\t\t\t\tPATROLMAN\n\t\tPlease.\n\n\tMary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed \n\tit when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in \n\tit, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it.\n\n\tThe Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, \n\tpokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to \n\tremove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling \n\ther fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then \n\tthe important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other \n\titems, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, \n\topens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at \n\tthe car.\n\n\tEXT. ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)\n\n\tThe Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks \n\tthe license plate, and returns.\n\n\tINT.

USED CAR LOT - (DAY)\n\n\tThe big sign reads \"California Charlie - Automobile Paradise.\" \n\tWe see Mary's car drive onto the lot and stop. Mary gets out \n\tof the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention \n\tto the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on \n\tall of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office:\n\n\t\t\t\tCAR DEALER\n\t\tWith you in a second!\n\n\tMary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making \n\ta selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand \n\ton the corner, just outside the lot.\n\n\tShe stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is \n\tfearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy \n\therself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, \n\tpicks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car \n\tlot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, \n\twe see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same \n\tPATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite \n\tside of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in \n\tthe newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see \n\tthe Patrolman.\n\n\tThe car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting \n\tfor Mary.

I'll just shoot this into \n\t\tthe garage.\n\n\tHe starts into Mary's car. She looks at him, in near panic, \n\twanting to skip the whole thing. Torn, wondering if the \n\tpresence of the Patrolman doesn't negate the value of changing \n\tcars, wondering how she can get away, wondering if she'll be \n\tfollowed, or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay \n\there.\n\n\tAll these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing. \n\tThe Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage.

HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT\n\n\tMary's car dashing along.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tMARY IN NEW CAR\n\n\tMary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. \n\tHer eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought.\n\n\tOUT THE WINDSHIELD\n\n\tWe can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk.\n\n\tMARY IN NEW CAR\n\n\tWe HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system, \n\ta sound emanating from Mary's imagination.\n\n\tAfter the second BUZZ, we HEAR the voice of Caroline.\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE'S VOICE\n\t\tYes, Mr. Lowery.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY'S VOICE\n\t\t\t(a worried tone)\n\t\tCaroline...? Mary still isn't in?\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE'S VOICE\n\t\tNo, Mr. Lowery... but then she's \n\t\talways a bit late on Monday mornings.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY'S VOICE\n\t\tBuzz me the minute she comes in.\n\n\tAgain Mary shakes her head, forces herself to stop hearing \n\tthese \"invented\" scenes of her imagination.\n\n\tEXT. HIGHWAY\n\n\tNow we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. \n\tDarkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see \n\tthe neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations \n\tbeginning to blaze on.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S NEW CAR\n\n\tBack on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices \n\tagain:\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY'S VOICE\n\t\tCall her sister! If no one's answering \n\t\tat the house....\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE'S VOICE\n\t\tI called her sister, Mr. Lowery, \n\t\twhere she works, the Music Makers \n\t\tMusic Store, you know? And she doesn't \n\t\tknow where Mary is any more than we \n\t\tdo.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY'S VOICE\n\t\tYou better run out to the house.  \n\t\tShe may be... unable to answer the \n\t\tphone...\n\n\t\t\t\tCAROLINE'S VOICE\n\t\tHer sister's going to do that.  She's \n\t\tas worried as we are.\n\n\tA flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. \n\tShe closes her eyes for one tight swift moment.\n\n\tEXT. HIGHWAY\n\n\tWe cut again to the highway. The first oncoming headlights \n\tslash at the windshield.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S NEW CAR\n\n\tCutting back to Mary, we can sense by the tense muscles of \n\ther face that she is driving faster. The oncoming headlights \n\tblurt at her.\n\n\tSuddenly we HEAR Lowery's voice, loud now and frightened, as \n\tif the anxiety in the man's voice was strong enough to break \n\tthrough Mary's effort to keep her mind silent and her \n\timagination blank.\n\n\t\t\t\tLOWERY'S VOICE\n\t\tNo! I haven't the faintest idea.  As \n\t\tI said, I last saw your sister when \n\t\tshe left this office on Friday... \n\t\tshe said she didn't feel well and \n\t\twanted to leave early and I said she \n\t\tcould.

Oh, for heaven's \n\t\tsake, a girl works for you for ten \n\t\tyears, you trust her! All right, \n\t\tyes, you better come over.\n\n\tFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT\n\n\tEXT. THE ROAD AHEAD INT. MARY'S NEW CAR\n\n\tFast cut back to Mary's face.

You \n\t\tstill trustin'? Hot creepers, she \n\t\tsat there while I dumped it out... \n\t\thardly even looked at it, plannin' \n\t\tand... and even flirtin' with me...!\n\n\tA look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes.\n\n\tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN\n\n\tBig drops of rain begin to appear.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MARY\n\n\tShe is becoming aware of the rain starting.\n\n\tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\n\tThe rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MARY\n\n\tMary starts the windshield wipers.\n\n\tTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\n\tThe wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MARY\n\n\tPeering through the blurred windshield.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS\n\n\tslowing down in the flooding highway.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - MARY\n\n\tpeering through the windshield.

THE ROAD\n\n\tAs we move closer, we see the neon sign more clearly and can \n\tfaintly make out the large letters which read \"Motel.\"  Mary \n\tstops the car, lowers the window slightly, looks out. We see \n\tthe sign clearly now: \"BATES MOTEL.\" Mary opens the car door \n\tand dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the \n\tmotel office.\n\n\tEXT. BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\n\n\tMary pauses on the porch. The lights are on within the office. \n\tShe tries door, finds it open, goes into office. CAMERA \n\tFOLLOWS her into office. There is no one present. Mary goes \n\tto the desk, rings a small pushbell. There is no response. \n\tMary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration, goes \n\tback out onto the porch. She looks off in another direction, \n\tslightly behind the office, and sees...\n\n\tMARY'S VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tA path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. \n\tThere is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms. A WOMAN \n\tpasses the window, pauses, peers out.\n\n\tWe see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from \n\tthe window.\n\n\tEXT. PORCH OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\n\n\tMary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get \n\tsome attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.\n\n\tNo one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes \n\tout into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, \n\tbegins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open \n\tthe front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. \n\tAfter a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house. \n\tMary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the \n\tporch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back \n\tonly to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to \n\tthe porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his \n\thand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached \n\tit.\n\n\tHe stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging \n\tuseless in his hand, then back to her.\n\n\tThere is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look. \n\tMary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him \n\talmost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back \n\tto indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the \n\toffice.\n\n\tINT. OFFICE OF BATES' MOTEL - (NIGHT)\n\n\tThe Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN \n\tBATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-\n\tspoken and hesitant.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tDirty night.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(not really a question)\n\t\tYou have a vacancy?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(simply, almost \n\t\t\tcheerfully)\n\t\tWe have twelve vacancies. Twelve \n\t\tcabins, twelve vacancies.\n\t\t\t(a pause)\n\t\tThey moved away the highway.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI thought I'd gotten off the main...\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI knew you must have. No one stops \n\t\there anymore unless they do.\n\n\tHe is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration \n\tbook.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tBut it's no good dwelling on our \n\t\tlosses, is it.  We go right ahead \n\t\tlighting signs and following the \n\t\tformalities...  Would you sign, \n\t\tplease.\n\n\tMary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the \n\tregistration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with \n\tthe realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes \n\tthe name Marie Samuels.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tYour home address. Oh, just the town \n\t\twill do.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(glancing at newspaper \n\t\t\tsticking out of her \n\t\t\thandbag)\n\t\tLos Angeles.\n\n\tShe realizes he didn't ask her to tell him, merely to write \n\tit down. She smiles, writes Los Angeles beside the false \n\tname. Norman smiles, stops smiling out of embarrassment.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tCabin One. It's closer in case you \n\t\twant anything... right next to the \n\t\toffice.\n\n\tCLOSEUP - NORMAN\n\n\tHe removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a \n\tremaining key on the board.\n\n\tTWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI want sleep more than anything.  \n\t\tExcept maybe, food.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tThere's a big diner about ten miles \n\t\ton up... just outside Fairvale.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tAm I that close to Fairvale?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tFifteen miles. I'll get your bags.\n\n\tHe goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down \n\tconsiderably. He smiles at this fact, as if to communicate \n\tsome pleasure he finds in it. Mary follows him to the door, \n\tgoes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to \n\ther car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of \n\tCabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door \n\tof Cabin One.\n\n\tNorman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, \n\topens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches \n\ton a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her.\n\n\tINT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tStuffy in here.\n\t\t\t(turns to her)\n\t\tWell... the mattress is soft and \n\t\tthere're hangers in the closet and... \n\t\tstationary with \"Bates' Motel\" printed \n\t\ton it in case you want to make your \n\t\tfriends back home envious... and... \n\t\tthe... over there....\n\t\t\t(he points to the \n\t\t\tbathroom, fairly \n\t\t\tblushes)\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tThe bathroom.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(quickly, starting to \n\t\t\tleave)\n\t\tI'll be in the office if you want \n\t\tanything... just tap on the wall.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tThank you, Mr. Bates.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tNorman Bates.\n\n\tHe pauses at the door, gazes at her.

Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She \n\tglances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into \n\tthe handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at \n\tit, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides \n\tto, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks \n\tabout, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such \n\tplaces are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her \n\tbag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places \n\tthe envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then \n\tplaces it on the bedside table as if it were there for later \n\treading. She considers this for a moment, accepts it, goes \n\tto her suitcase to start unpacking.\n\n\tSuddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill, ugly sound of \n\ta woman's voice, raised in anger.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tNo! I tell you no!\n\n\tMary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible \n\tvoice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA \n\tFOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is \n\tstill on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming \n\tfrom that room. The rain has stopped and the moon is out.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tI won't have you bringing strange \n\t\tyoung girls in for supper...\n\t\t\t(an ugly, sneering \n\t\t\tnote creeps into the \n\t\t\tvoice)\n\t\t...by candlelight, I suppose, in the \n\t\tcheap erotic fashion of young men \n\t\twith cheap, erotic minds!\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tMother, please...\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tAnd then what?

Shut up!\n\n\tThere is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there. \n\tMary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress \n\tand concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes \n\tsadly at the little empty room.\n\n\tIn a moment there is the SOUND of the house's front door \n\tslamming shut. Mary turns, looks out the window.\n\n\tFROM MARY'S VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)\n\n\tWe see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered \n\ttray.\n\n\tINT. CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tMary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to \n\tthe door, opens it and goes out onto the porch.\n\n\tEXT. THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)\n\n\tMary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when \n\tNorman comes round the building and walks along the porch, \n\tpast the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He \n\tstares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her \n\teye.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI've caused you some trouble.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tMother...\n\t\t\t(a hollow little laugh, \n\t\t\tan attempt at sardonic \n\t\t\thumor)\n\t\t...what is the phrase... \"she isn't \n\t\therself today\"... I think that's it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(looking at the tray)\n\t\tYou shouldn't have bothered. I really \n\t\tdon't have that much of an appetite.\n\n\tNorman flinches, realizing she has heard his mother's \n\treference to Mary's appetite.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI'm sorry. I wish... people could \n\t\tapologize for other people.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tDon't worry about it.\n\t\t\t(a warm smile)\n\t\tBut as long as you've made us supper, \n\t\twe may as well eat it. Huh?\n\n\tShe begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, \n\thesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young \n\twoman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in \n\tdefiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his \n\tdefiance for one day. He cannot go into Mary's room.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt might be nicer... warmer in the \n\t\toffice.\n\n\tWithout waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries \n\tto the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused \n\tsympathy, then follows.\n\n\tINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable \n\tplace to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing \n\tin the doorway.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tEating in an office...\n\t\t\t(a rueful smile)\n\t\t...to officious, even for me. I have \n\t\tthe parlor behind this... if you'd \n\t\tlike.\n\n\tMary nods. Norman walks on, behind the counter and into the \n\tdarkened parlor. Mary follows.\n\n\tINT. NORMAN'S PARLOR -(NIGHT)\n\n\tIn the darkened room, lit only by the light from the office \n\tspilling in, we see Norman placing the tray on a table. Mary \n\tcomes to the doorway, pauses. Norman straightens up, goes to \n\tlamp, turns on the light.\n\n\tMary is startled by the room. Even in the dimness of one \n\tlamp, the strange, extraordinary nature of the room rushes \n\tup at one. It is a room of birds. Stuffed birds, all over \n\tthe room, on every available surface, one even clinging to \n\tthe old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp. The birds are \n\tof many varieties, beautiful, grand, horrible, preying. Mary \n\tstares in awe and a certain fascinated horror.\n\n\tCLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tPlease sit down. On the sofa.\n\n\tAs Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and \n\tpouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She studies \n\tthe birds as she walks, briefly examines a bookcase stacked \n\twith books on the subject of \"Taxidermy.\"\n\n\tCLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED. CLOSE SHOT - MARY\n\n\tShe notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, \n\tand many with a vaguely religious overtone.\n\n\tFinally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tYou're very... kind.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt's all for you. I'm not hungry.  \n\t\tPlease go ahead.\n\n\tMary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a \n\tsmall slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in \n\tthe manner of one disturbed and preoccupied.\n\n\tNorman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles \n\tand then laughs.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tYou eat like a bird.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tYou'd know, of course.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tNot really. I hear that expression, \n\t\tthat one eats \"like a bird,\" is really \n\t\ta falsie, I mean a falsity, because \n\t\tbirds eat a tremendous lot.\n\t\t\t(A pause, then \n\t\t\texplaining)\n\t\tOh, I don't know anything about birds. \n\t\tMy hobby is stuffing things... \n\t\ttaxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather \n\t\tstuff birds because...  well, I hate \n\t\tthe look of beasts when they're \n\t\tstuffed, foxes and chimps and all... \n\t\tsome people even stuff dogs and \n\t\tcats... but I can't... I think only \n\t\tbirds look well stuffed because \n\t\tthey're rather...  passive, to begin \n\t\twith... most of them...\n\n\tHe trails off, his exuberance failing in the rushing return \n\tof his natural hesitancy and discomfort. Mary looks at him, \n\twith some compression, smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tIt's a strange hobby. Curious, I \n\t\tmean.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tUncommon, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tI imagine so.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt's not as expensive as you'd think. \n\t\tCheap, really. Needles, thread, \n\t\tsawdust .. the chemicals are all \n\t\tthat cost anything.\n\t\t\t(He goes quiet, looks \n\t\t\tdisturbed)\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tA man should have a hobby.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt's more than a hobby... sometimes... \n\t\ta hobby is supposed to pass the time, \n\t\tnot fill it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(after a pause, softly)\n\t\tIs your time so empty?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tOh, no!\n\t\t\t(forcing brightness \n\t\t\tagain)\n\t\tI run the office, tend the cabins \n\t\tand grounds, do little chores for \n\t\tmother... the ones she allows I might \n\t\tbe capable of doing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tYou go out... with friends?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tFriends?

I think we're \n\t\tall in our private traps, clamped in \n\t\tthem, and none of us can ever climb \n\t\tout. We scratch and claw... but only \n\t\tat the air, only at each other, and \n\t\tfor all of it, we never budge an \n\t\tinch.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tSometimes we deliberately step into \n\t\tthose traps.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI was born in mine.

Mother met a man. \n\t\tHe talked her into building this \n\t\tmotel... We could have talked her \n\t\tinto anything... and when.  Well... \n\t\tIt was just too much for her when he \n\t\tdied, too... And the way he died... \n\t\tOh, it's nothing to talk about when \n\t\tyou're eating.\n\t\t\t(Pauses, smiles)\n\t\tAnyway, it was too much of a loss \n\t\tfor my mother... she had nothing \n\t\tleft.\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\t\t(Critically)\n\t\tExcept you.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tA son is a poor substitute for a \n\t\tlover.\n\t\t\t(Turns away as if in \n\t\t\tdistaste of the word)\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tWhy don't you go away?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tTo a private island, like you?\n\n\t\t\t\tMARY\n\t\tNo, not like me.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt's too late for me.

There is a brief silence.\n\n\tMary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained \n\tby his anguish.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(Quietly)\n\t\tI've suggested it myself.

We see her, from Norman's \n\tviewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into \n\tthe night. Norman turns and looks at the table, and we see \n\this face now. It is bright with that drunken-like look of \n\tdetermination and encouragement and like resolve. He starts \n\tto clean up the table, pauses as he hears the closing of \n\tMary's door in the cabin next door.\n\n\tHe holds still, listens. He goes into the office and looks \n\tat the book.\n\n\tC.U. - THE NAME \"SAMUELS\"\n\n\tM.S. - NORMAN\n\n\tHe goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. \n\tThe sound of Mary moving about her room come over, soft \n\tSOUNDS, somehow intimate in the night quiet. Norman turns \n\this ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting \n\tan impulse to listen, or more than listen.\n\n\tBut slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and, \n\tresisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of \n\this head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too \n\thad our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a \n\tpicture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning \n\tagainst. Slowly he starts toward it.\n\n\tHe reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame \n\toff the wall.\n\n\tA tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the \n\thole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is \n\tvery dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light \n\tstriking Norman's face.\n\n\tWe move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile \n\tfills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See \n\tthe small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps \n\tthrough.\n\n\tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT\n\n\tThrough the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary \n\tundressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over \n\ta bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to \n\tunhook her bra.\n\n\tNORMAN - ECU\n\n\tHe watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up \n\tand down the unseen figure of Mary.\n\n\tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT\n\n\tMary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.\n\n\tNORMAN\n\n\tHe turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues \n\tturning until he can look out the small parlor window.\n\n\tWe see, as he sees...\n\n\tTHE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND\n\n\tNORMAN\n\n\tHe turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we \n\tsee anger and anguish. And then resolve.\n\n\tQuickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in \n\tthe wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go \n\tthrough the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering \n\tto close the door behind him.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman walking along the porch, in the direction of the big \n\thouse. Once on the path he pauses, looks up at the light in \n\tthe bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his \n\tshoulders, strides manfully up the path.\n\n\tCAMERA follows behind him. He opens the door of the house, \n\tenters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look \n\tup at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He \n\tholds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage \n\tevaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-\n\tpasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen. \n\tAt the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen, drops \n\twearily into a chair. After a moment, he stretches out a leg \n\tand gently pushes the kitchen door closed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. MARY'S MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)\n\n\tMary is seated at the small desk, engrossed in figuring in a \n\tsmall notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which \n\tindicates her intention to make a restitution of the money \n\tshe has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her \n\tbankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly \n\tbeneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after \n\tsubtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which \n\tmatches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.\n\n\tBeneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after \n\tsubtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not \n\twearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure \n\tthat comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to \n\tcontinue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the \n\tpage out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into \n\tsmall pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces \n\tinto the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her \n\trobe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on.\n\n\tINT. MARY IN SHOWER\n\n\tOver the bar on which hangs the shower curtain, we can see \n\tthe bathroom door, not entirely closed. For a moment we watch \n\tMary as she washes and soaps herself.\n\n\tThere is still a small worry in her eyes, but generally she \n\tlooks somewhat relieved.\n\n\tNow we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.\n\n\tThe noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is \n\tthen slowly and carefully closed.\n\n\tAnd we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower \n\tcurtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white \n\tbrightness of the bathroom is almost blinding.\n\n\tSuddenly we see the hand reach up, grasp the shower curtain, \n\trip it aside.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tMARY - ECU\n\n\tAs she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower \n\tcurtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in \n\ther face. A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her \n\tthroat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous \n\tbread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to \n\tan almost total, silver blankness.\n\n\tTHE SLASHING\n\n\tAn impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very \n\tscreen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of \n\tscreaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as \n\tMary's body falls in the tub.\n\n\tREVERSE ANGLE\n\n\tThe blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand \n\tpulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a \n\tglimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with \n\tmadness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a \n\tfright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across \n\tthe tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the \n\tshower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a \n\tmoment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tTHE DEAD BODY\n\n\tLying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, \n\ttouching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if \n\tpopped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor.  \n\tComing down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along \n\tthe porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA \n\tFOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the \n\tbathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA \n\tapproaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed \n\tit on the bedside table.\n\n\tCLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER\n\n\tbeside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window \n\tand looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, \n\tcoming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, \n\tshocked voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tMother! Oh God, what... blood, \n\t\tblood... mother...!\n\n\tWe cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations.\n\n\tAfter a moment or two of silence, Norman emerges from the \n\tfront door, dashes down the path toward the motel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQUICK CUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. THE PATH - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman is coming AT CAMERA, running head-on. He dashes into \n\tan extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in \n\this face. CAMERA PANS as Norman races past, holds as Norman \n\truns to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Mary's \n\troom.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S CABIN - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman pauses a moment in the doorway, glances about the \n\troom, hears the shower going, sees the bathroom door is open. \n\tHe goes to the bathroom, looks in, sees the body.\n\n\tSlowly, almost carefully, he raises his hands to his face, \n\tcovers his eyes, turns his face away. Then he crosses to the \n\twindow, looks out at the house. Shot is so angled that we \n\tsee the bedside table with the newspaper on it.\n\n\tAfter a moment, Norman moves from the window, sinks onto the \n\tedge of the bed.\n\n\tFRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN\n\n\tNorman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can \n\tsee only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile \n\tfloor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of \n\this dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the \n\tpeace that comes with decision.\n\n\tNorman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with \n\tresolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across \n\tit. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch, \n\tand draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the \n\tbedroom light, leaving the room lit only by the spill from \n\tthe bathroom. He opens the front door, goes out.\n\n\tEXT. THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman comes out of Mary's cabin, closes the door carefully \n\tbehind him, goes along the porch to his office, goes in. We \n\tstay outside. Immediately, the \"Vacancy\" sign goes off, and \n\tthen the motel sign goes off. As CAMERA GOES closer to the \n\toffice, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door \n\topening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up. Norman \n\tcomes out of office, closes door, looks cautiously about, \n\tgoes along porch, carrying pail with mop in it, goes into \n\tMary's cabin, closing the door after him.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S CABIN\n\n\tWith the paper in the foreground, Norman enters. We can see \n\thim in the dim spill of light. He pauses by the door, then \n\tgathers his strength and goes into the bathroom. We HEAR him \n\tset the pail on the tiled floor, and then we HEAR the shower \n\tbeing turned off. And there is total silence. CAMERA MOVES \n\tFORWARD so that we can see into bathroom.\n\n\tCAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up. \n\tQuickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges \n\twith it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him \n\tspread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside \n\tthe bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of \n\tit comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over \n\tand onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and \n\tCAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman. \n\tHe works carefully, with his arms extended away from his \n\tbody, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it \n\tacross the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain \n\tin the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up, \n\texamines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to \n\tthe bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.\n\n\tCLOSE SHOT\n\n\tWe see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being \n\tdiluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.\n\n\tNORMAN\n\n\tWe see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn \n\tto the job of cleaning the bathroom.\n\n\tHe places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the \n\tmop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the \n\twall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and \n\teven the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel \n\tand goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.  \n\tFinally he rinses and squeezes out the mop, empties the pail, \n\tcleans out the tub, and goes out into the bedroom.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S BEDROOM\n\n\tNorman steps carefully around the unseen body, crosses to \n\tthe desk, starts going through Mary's handbag, in search of \n\ther car keys. He suddenly notices them lying on the desk, \n\twhere he'd thrown them after parking her car. He picks up \n\tthe keys, crosses the room, goes out.\n\n\tEXT. THE PORCH\n\n\tWe see Norman pauses at the door, check cautiously, then \n\thurry across the porch and into Mary's car. He circle-turns \n\tthe car, so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch, \n\tdirectly opposite Mary's door, as close as it can go.\n\n\tThen he alights, goes to the trunk, opens it with the key \n\tand, leaving the trunk lid raised, goes back into the cabin.\n\n\tINT. MARY'S ROOM\n\n\tFrom a raised angle, we see Norman bend down and begin to \n\twrap the shower curtain around the body. We see the edges of \n\tthe curtain as they are raised and laid down again. Then he \n\tpicks up the wrapped body, crosses to the door, uses his \n\tfoot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind \n\thim, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body \n\tin the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it. \n\tHe comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely, \n\tflicks on the light.\n\n\tAgain the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he \n\tpauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he \n\tis doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues \n\twith his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to \n\tgather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase. \n\tHe checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks \n\tunder bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that \n\troom again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about \n\tcarefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the \n\tsuitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl \n\tare gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks \n\tit up.\n\n\tWith his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the \n\tmop and the used towels. He crosses to the door, switches \n\toff the light with his shoulder, pulls open the door, starts \n\tout.\n\n\tEXT. THE PORCH\n\n\tAs Norman stands in the doorway, he is suddenly and blindingly \n\tlit by the bright headlights of a passing car. The flash of \n\tthe lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a \n\tflicker of a moment, but it takes a few seconds for Norman \n\tto regain his former tense composure. Then he goes to the \n\tcar trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and \n\tthe pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then \n\trealizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin. \n\tHe returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the \n\tnewspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the \n\tnewspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance \n\tgoes right over the toilet bowl.\n\n\tHe turns out the lights, crosses the darkened cabin, goes \n\tout onto the porch.\n\n\tHe reopens the trunk, tosses in the newspaper and closes it. \n\tHe goes around and jumps into the car and starts away.\n\n\tWe HOLD on the trunk, follow it for a while, then\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)\n\n\tThe car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as \n\tCAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area.\n\n\tIt is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects. \n\tNorman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp, turns \n\toff the lights, gets out, leaving door open. He looks at the \n\tswamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car, \n\trealizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases \n\tthe emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car \n\tbegins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW, \n\tTHROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.\n\n\tThe SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane \n\tflying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps \n\taway, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the \n\tplane overhead grows louder.\n\n\tNorman looks up.\n\n\tNORMAN'S VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY\n\n\tWe see no plane. The SOUND of the motor is beginning to \n\tdiminish.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT BACK TO:\n\n\tNORMAN\n\n\tWe see the relief in his face. He looks at the car.\n\n\tMore than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp. \n\tThe trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime, \n\tas if refusing to go the rest of the way. Norman begins to \n\tpanic, he steps dangerously close, pushes with his foot. And \n\tslowly the car sinks, until finally it is gone and we hear \n\tonly the gentle plop of the swamp's final gulp, and see only \n\tthe small after-bubble, like a visual burp.\n\n\tNorman waits a moment, then begins stamping out the tire \n\tmarks, so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp.\n\n\tHe stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tCLOSE UP NORMAN\n\n\tstanding on the porch of the motel, leaning against a post. \n\tHe is staring out into the night, a look of guarded, casual \n\tinnocence on his face, as if he were taking one last moment \n\tof peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down \n\tand CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground \n\toutside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the \n\ttire marks.\n\n\tAfter a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose, \n\tplaces it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see \n\tthat the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the \n\troad markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a \n\tcar had been parked here.\n\n\tAfter a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it \n\toff, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away \n\tfrom the spot, past the office, heading for the path that \n\tleads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps \n\tof the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up \n\tthe steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES \n\tas he pauses at the foot of the stairs. Norman goes up the \n\tstairs.\n\n\tOn the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is \n\tclosed. Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained \n\tdress and a pair of elderly-woman's shoes. From an EXTREMELY \n\tHIGH ANGLE, we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up \n\tthe stained dress and shoes.\n\n\tHe rolls the shoes into the dress, tucks the small, neat \n\tbundle under his arm, and starts down the stairs, heading \n\tfor the basement.\n\n\tEXT. A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tIt stands silhouetted against the sky. There is a long wait. \n\tThen, slowly, a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE OUT:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t FADE IN\n\n\tINT. BACK ROOM OF SAM'S HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)\n\n\tSam is seated at his desk, writing a letter. Sequence\n\n\tbegins with CAMERA IN CLOSE, over Sam's shoulder, and we can \n\tread as mush as he has written of the letter. The letterhead \n\treads \"Sam Loomis - Hardware,\" and the letter reads: \"Dearest \n\tright-as-always Mary: I'm sitting in this tiny back room \n\twhich isn't big enough for both of us, and suddenly it looks \n\tbig enough for both of us. So what if we're poor and cramped \n\tand miserable, at least we'll be happy! If you haven't come \n\tto your senses, and still want to...\n\n\tCAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper \n\tover, continues backing away out of the small back room and \n\theads, backwards, down the corridor, we see a young clerk, \n\tBOB SUMMERFIELD, Sam's assistant, standing behind the counter, \n\ta look of handsome patience on his face. He is waiting on a \n\tmeticulous, elderly woman customer, who is holding and \n\texamining a large can of insecticide. As CAMERA PASSES:\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN CUSTOMER\n\t\t...They tell you what its ingredients \n\t\tare and how it's guaranteed to \n\t\texterminate any insect in the world, \n\t\tbut they do not tell you whether or \n\t\tnot it's painless. And I say insect \n\t\tor man, death should always be \n\t\tpainless.\n\n\tCAMERA, by this has reached the front door of the hardware \n\tstore and we now see a girl standing just inside the door. \n\tShe is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner, a \n\tlook of purposefulness. She carries a handbag and a small \n\tovernight case. She is Mary's sister, LILA CRANE.\n\n\tBob Summerfield has noticed Lila, smiles brightly at her, \n\tgives her an I'll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod.\n\n\tLila starts to walk toward the counter, never taking her \n\teyes off Bob. As she approaches, she asks quietly:\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tSam?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUMMERFIELD\n\t\tYou want to see Sam?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tSam Loomis.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUMMERFIELD\n\t\t\t(yelling toward back \n\t\t\troom)\n\t\tSam! Lady wants to see you!\n\n\tLila looks to the back room. The woman customer goes on \n\tworriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can. \n\tSam comes to the door of his room, pauses, looks at Lila a \n\tmoment, starts toward her, his expression indicating that he \n\tdoes not know her. Lila studies him with a quiet, worried \n\texpression.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tYes?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tMay I talk to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(a bit mystified)\n\t\tSure...\n\n\tLila glances at the customer and the clerk, turns, starts \n\ttoward the front of the store. Sam holds a moment, then \n\tfollows. As he reaches her, she turns, her eyes studying him \n\tintently as she says:\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tI'm Mary's sister.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tLila.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\t\t(quickly)\n\t\tIs Mary here?\n\n\tSam is mystified, and is also aware of the worried, hostile \n\texpression on Lila's face. He studies her for a quiet moment. \n\tBehind them is a display of various size carving knives.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tIs something wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tI want to know if my sister is here.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHere?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tWith you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhere?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tI don't know where.

Sam is now staring \n\tapprehensively at Lila.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhat should I know?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tTo begin with, where Mary is. Do \n\t\tyou?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tNo. I take it you don't either?\n\t\t\t(As Lila shakes her \n\t\t\thead)\n\t\tHow long?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tLast Friday. She left work, and \n\t\thome...

Then I'll go back to Phoenix \n\t\tand...\n\n\tShe stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes \n\tbeginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a \n\tmoment, then turns and calls:\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBob? Run out and get yourself some \n\t\tlunch.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUMMERFIELD\n\t\tIt's okay, Sam, I brought it with \n\t\tme.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tRun out and eat it.\n\n\tBob gets the message, goes out through the back way.\n\n\tSam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhat thing?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhat thing could we be in together?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tI hate tears.\n\t\t\t(Takes out hankie)\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tIs Mary... in trouble?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tYes.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWell why didn't she come to me...  \n\t\tcall me...?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tNot that kind...\n\t\t\t(Almost a smile)\n\t\tYou men and your egos.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(Seriously)\n\t\tNever mind my ego.

Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own \n\tface showing apprehension. Arbogast backs the car around \n\tvery slowly, his gaze divided between the old house and the \n\tlighted window of Cabin Two.

Arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, \n\tsees only darkness. Then he goes to the door, listens for \n\talong moment, hears nothing.\n\n\tVery slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door \n\tand pushes gently with his arm and shoulder.

FOYER OF BATES' HOUSE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tArbogast gradually eases the door closed, stands against it, \n\twaiting. He looks up in the direction of the light, sees no \n\tone. The door at the head of the stairs is closed. Arbogast \n\tlistens, holds his breath, hears what could be human sounds \n\tcoming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the \n\tsounds of an old house after sunset. After a careful wait, \n\the crosses to the stairs, starts up, slowly, guardedly, \n\tplacing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks \n\tor groans before placing his full weight on it.

Blood spurts. \n\tThe sudden attack throws him off balance. He stumbles back \n\tand staggers down the whole of the staircase. He frantically \n\tgropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the \n\tstairs. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way. A wicked knife \n\tkeeps thrusting itself into the foreground.

Sam starts toward the back room, pauses at \n\tthe doorway, turns. Lila has remained by the door, looking \n\tout at the street. She feels his pause, turns, and for a \n\tmoment they share at each other across the darkened room.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tLet's go see Al Chambers.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tWho's he?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHe's the Deputy Sheriff around here.\n\n\tAs he starts forward.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. STREET THE SHERIFF LIVES ON - (NIGHT)\n\n\tA dark, quiet, tree-ceilinged street, the small neat houses \n\tdim in the moonlight. Sam's pick-up truck comes down the \n\tstreet, pulls up before the house of Sheriff Chambers. CAMERA \n\tMOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the \n\ttruck's cab, staring quietly at the sleeping house.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tOur Deputy sleeps.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tWell?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tNothing.

CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door. \n\tSam presses the bell button. Both he and Lila are almost \n\tknocked over by the shocking, clanging, ear-splitting BLAST \n\tOF THE BELL within the house, a ring which sounds more like \n\ta fire alarm than a doorbell.\n\n\tHe tries to smile, fails. Lila doesn't even try. The \n\tdownstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is \n\tunhesitatingly opened by MRS. CHAMBERS, a small, lively stick \n\tof a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of \n\thospitality.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. CHAMBERS\n\t\tOh?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tSorry, Mrs. Chambers.

CHAMBERS\n\t\tCustomers!\n\n\tSHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs, in a bathrobe which \n\tmatches his wife's. He is a tall, narrow man with a face \n\toriginally destined for Mount Rushmore.

NORMAN'S PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tNorman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to \n\thim, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to \n\tmove his hand after hanging up. He is staring at the shrike-\n\tlike bird which is perched on the lamp shade. Decision and \n\tresolution are beginning to show in his face. Suddenly he \n\trises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off \n\tthe lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking \n\tthe bird off the shade.\n\n\tHe watches it fall, does not try to catch it. It hits the \n\tfloor with a thud and sawdust spills out. He stares sadly at \n\tit, for a moment, then tends down, scoops up the sawdust, \n\ttries to press it into the split seam, picks up the bird, \n\tputs it in a drawer.

It does not stop at the top however, but continues \n\ton the same high angle that we had in Scene 57.\n\n\tShe starts to laugh, a terrible sound like an obscene melody.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN'S VOICE\n\t\tI'll carry you, mother.\n\n\tNorman comes out of the room, his mother held in his arms, \n\ther head leaning against his shoulder.

FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)\n\n\tAn overcast morning, but a sunny-faced crowd.

I got a job, too.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tI wonder if that hurt her, my not \n\t\tletting her sacrifice for me?

THE BATES MOTEL AND HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tThe place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep \n\tgray of the cloudy sky. We see Sam's truck turning into the \n\tdriveway and pulling to a stop. After a moment, Sam and Lila \n\tget out of the truck.\n\n\tFRESH ANGLE\n\n\tClose on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the \n\ttruck. The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in \n\tb.g. of shot. Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment, then \n\tturn and gaze up at the house. There is no figure in the \n\twindow and the shade is drawn. Same goes to the office door, \n\tpeers in, knocks, opens door, enters. Lila remains on the \n\tdriveway, beside the truck.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. THE MOTHER'S ROOM - (DAY)\n\n\tCLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window. He has pulled \n\tthe curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at \n\tthe motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila, who is \n\tstanding by the truck and looking up at the house.  Norman \n\tstudies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he \n\tcloses the curtains, turns away.\n\n\tWe see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic \n\tand his struggle to contain it. Then he goes away. CAMERA \n\tremains on window, shooting out and down, and through the \n\tfrail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel \n\toffice and joins Lila.\n\n\tEXT.

CAMERA PANS with them, and as they turn around the \n\toffice corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward \n\tthem. They pause and Norman pauses. He does not smile, nor \n\tspeak. His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone; \n\tcontainment and impassivity lie in their place.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(Cheerfully)\n\t\tJust coming up to ring for you.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(Coming forward)\n\t\tI suppose you want a cabin.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWe'd hoped to make it straight to \n\t\tSan Francisco, but we don't like the \n\t\tlook of that sky.

Sam and Lila follow \n\tNorman.\n\n\tINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tNorman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to \n\tcabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have \n\tentered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI'll take you to...\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBetter sign in first, hasn't we?\n\n\tSam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tIt isn't necessary.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(Interrupting with a \n\t\t\tfriendly cheerfulness)\n\t\tUh, uh! My boss is paying for this \n\t\ttrip... ninety percent business... \n\t\tand he wants practically notarized \n\t\treceipts. I better sign in and get a \n\t\treceipt.\n\n\tNorman stares at Sam, as if he'd like to yell at him, call \n\thim \"liar.\" Instead he reaches under the desk counter, brings \n\tout the registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the \n\tbook as Sam signs in. Sam signs \"Joe and Mrs. Johnson.\"  The \n\tsignature and city of \"Marie Samuels\" and after it, the \n\tnotation \"Cabin One,\" can be clearly seen three registrations \n\tabove Sam's.\n\n\tWhen Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. \n\tNorman does not take it, starts out from behind counter.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI'll get your bags.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHaven't any.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(after a stare)\n\t\tI'll show you the cabin.\n\n\tAs he starts for the door, Sam laughs.

Lila steps up to the desk, picks \n\tup the key, quickly, starts out.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tI'll start ahead.\n\n\tNorman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door.\n\n\tEXT. THE MOTEL - (DAY)\n\n\tLila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries \n\tthe door. It opens.

CAMERA REMAINS with Norman, who is standing by \n\tthe office door, looking after Sam and Lila, his face alert \n\tand no longer impassive. He waits a moment, after they have \n\tclosed their cabin door, then crosses to the pickup truck.  \n\tCAMERA MOVES with him. He studies the truck, then leans in \n\tthrough the driver's window, twists the registration card \n\taround, reads it.\n\n\tIt gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis.\n\n\tNorman comes back out of the window, glances once more toward \n\tcabin twelve, then at the old house. His suspicions are \n\tconfirmed, and now there is the relaxation of relief in his \n\tface. He takes on a purposeful air, turns, strides up the \n\tpath, up onto the porch of the house, opens the door, goes \n\tin.\n\n\tINT. CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila is at the cabin's rear window, looking out, straining \n\tfor a glimpse of the old house, which cannot be seen from \n\tthe window of this cabin.\n\n\tShe turns, frustrated, anxious. Sam is standing at the foot \n\tof the bed, staring at the smooth coverlet, his brow creased \n\tin a sadness.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tWe should have asked for Cabin One... \n\t\tThe one Mary was in.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI'm glad we didn't.\n\n\tHe pulls his eyes from the bed, crosses to the desk, sits \n\twearily, lights a cigarette. Lila watches him for a moment, \n\tfeels a real compassion, goes to the bed, sits on its edge, \n\tturns again and looks at Sam's back.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tWe have to go into that cabin and \n\t\tsearch it, Sam... no matter what \n\t\twe're afraid of finding and no matter \n\t\thow much it may hurt.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI know.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tDo you think if something happened, \n\t\tit happened there?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\t\t(A pause, then:)\n\t\tSam, if you owned a useless business \n\t\tlike this motel... one you probably \n\t\tcouldn't even sell...  what would \n\t\tyou need to get away, to start a new \n\t\tbusiness, somewhere else?\n\t\t\t(As Sam studies her)\n\t\tForty thousand dollars?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tHow could we prove...\n\t\t\t(An almost hopeless \n\t\t\tlaugh)\n\t\tWell, if he opens a new motel on the \n\t\tnew highway... say, a year from now...\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tThere must be some proof that exists \n\t\tright now!

Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on \n\tto the office, opens the door, calls in:\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBates?\n\n\tHe waits, there is no response. He goes in and in a moment \n\tcomes back out, closes the door, goes to Lila.\n\n\tShe has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started \n\tto enter.\n\n\tINT. CABIN ONE - (DAY)\n\n\tThe blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark.\n\n\tSam comes in after Lila, closes the door behind him.\n\n\tFor a moment they just gaze at the room, as if willing it to \n\ttell them some satisfactory story.\n\n\tNeither speaks. Then, in dark silence, they begin to search, \n\tgoing methodically and thoroughly through all drawers, the \n\tcloset, the desk, searching under the bed and in dark corners, \n\tnot knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to \n\tfind some thing. Lila opens the bathroom door, looks in. The \n\twindowless room is very dark. She switches on the light, \n\tgoes in. Sam moves toward the bathroom, is about to follow \n\ther in when he notices which room it is and automatically \n\tcatches himself up, backs out.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tSorry.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tHospital clean.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tThe bathroom. Look at how clean it \n\t\tis. The one in our cabin is clean... \n\t\tbut this is clean!\n\n\tSam goes in, glances around, nods. Lila goes through the \n\tmedicine cabinet, finds nothing but a glass and two tiny \n\ttabs of soap. Sam leans against the door-jamb, looks at the \n\ttub, the shower pipe above it. He continues to stare, more \n\tinterested suddenly, as if bothered by some off-key evidence \n\the can't put his finger on. Then he looks at the shower \n\tcurtain rod.\n\n\tAnd realizes there is no shower curtain. He frowns, is about \n\tto say something when Lila, who has been momentarily out of \n\tshot, interrupts.\n\n\tSam turns, CAMERA TURNS, and we see Lila is standing above \n\tthe toilet bowl, a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip \n\tof her right index finger.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhat is it?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tIt didn't get washed down.

She pauses at the head of the stair. The \n\tdoor on her right, which opens into the mother's room, is \n\tclosed. To her left is another door, half-open. Directly \n\tbefore her is a third door, closed. She holds a long moment, \n\ttrying to picture in her mind which room would look out on \n\tthe front of the house, decides, chooses the correct door, \n\tthe one on her right.

She stands on the threshold, looking in at \n\tthe room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her \n\texpression indicating an impulse to close the door and go \n\taway from this room forever.\n\n\tAfter a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind \n\ther. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as \n\tLila sees it.\n\n\tIt is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, \n\tan olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of \n\tthe last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the \n\tdressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a \n\tgreat chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-\n\tlength pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite \n\tthe door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the \n\twindow, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled \n\twith ashes.\n\n\tAnd there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if \n\teven though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long \n\tvacated by some musty presence.\n\n\tLila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over \n\tit, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on \n\tit, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-\n\tlike position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes \n\tto the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and \n\tjars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an \n\topened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of \n\thair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of \n\therself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to \n\tthe chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high \n\twardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, \n\thesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed \n\tdresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters \n\tand dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-\n\ttype bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.  \n\tAlong the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished \n\tshoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once \n\tagain over the whole room, starts out,\n\n\tINT. THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind \n\ther, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to \n\tthe room whose door is half-open. The room within is dark, \n\tthe shades drawn full.\n\n\tLila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, \n\tthrows on a switch.\n\n\tINT. MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tSam has risen, is standing by the counter now.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI'm not saying you shouldn't be \n\t\tcontented here, I'm just doubting \n\t\tthat you are. I think if you saw a \n\t\tchance to get out from under...  \n\t\tyou'd unload this place...\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(Angrily)\n\t\tThis place! This isn't 'a place.'  \n\t\tIt's my only world. I grew up in \n\t\tthat house back there. I was a happy \n\t\tchild. My mother and I... we were \n\t\tmore than happy.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tAnd now that your mother's dead?\n\n\tNorman snaps a sharp, fast, ugly look at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tMy mother is not dead!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(Softly)\n\t\tI didn't think so.\n\n\tINT. NORMAN'S ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila is standing in the doorway, staring at the room in sick \n\tdismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy \n\tof childhood held beyond the point of decency.\n\n\tIt is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping \n\tsilhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and \n\tfat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far \n\ttoo short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled \n\tcovers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.  \n\tNext to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top \n\tthere are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an \n\tash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's \n\tshirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.\n\n\tAgainst one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled \n\twith thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white \n\tchest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record \n\ton the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be \n\tBeethoven's Eroica Symphony.\n\n\tLila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances \n\tat the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase \n\tand pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens \n\tit. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust. \n\tShe slams the book closed, drops it.\n\n\tINT. THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)\n\n\tNorman, behind the counter, has moved back against the wall. \n\tSam is still on the other side of the counter, but is leaning \n\tforward, his eyes hard on Norman's face.\n\n\tNorman's face is no longer expressionless. It has the stark, \n\thigh sheen of a cornered animal.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(Pressing)\n\t\tYou look frightened. Have I been \n\t\tsaying something frightening?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tI don't know what you've been saying.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI've been talking about your mother... \n\t\tabout your motel. How are you going \n\t\tto do it?\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tDo what?\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tBuy a new one! In a new town!\n\t\tWhere you won't have to hide your \n\t\tmother!\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tShut up!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhere will you get the money to do \n\t\tthat, Bates... or do you already \n\t\thave it... socked away... a lot of \n\t\tit...\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tLeave me alone!\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t...Forty thousand dollars!\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tLeave me alone!\n\n\tHe is close to panic now. He turns, swiftly, dashes back \n\tinto his private parlor. Sam goes quickly around the counter, \n\tfollows.\n\n\tINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)\n\n\tNorman hears Sam following, wants to run, to never be reached \n\tby this man. He crosses the small room, drawn to the rear \n\twindow, as if he might fly through it. Sam enters, pauses.  \n\tNorman turns, back against the window, as unable to fly away \n\tas are the many still, stuffed birds. Sam registers a brief \n\tflicker of reaction when he sees the birds, but continues to \n\tgaze at Norman, hard.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tI bet your mother knows where the \n\t\tmoney is. And what you did to get \n\t\tit. And I think she'll tell us.\n\n\tSomething self-assured and confident in Sam's tone gives \n\tNorman a new, more terrified alarm. He turns his head, glances \n\tout the window at the old house. He looks back at Sam and \n\tthere is terror in his voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\tWhere's that girl? The girl you came \n\t\twith! Where is she?\n\n\tSam does not respond, smiles a half-smile, turns to examine \n\ta stuffed owl. Norman looks back at the house.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN\n\t\t\t(A horrible groan)\n\t\tOh, God!\n\n\tINT. UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila, shaken and disturbed, almost sickened, is coming out \n\tof Norman's room. She has left the light on. She pauses in \n\tthe middle of the landing, looks at the closed door opposite \n\tthe stairs, goes to it, opens it, sees that it is the \n\tbathroom, pulls the door to, turns, starts toward the stairs.\n\n\tINT. NORMAN'S PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)\n\n\tSam is lying on the floor, face downward, unmoving. A \n\tcandlestick is on the floor, close by his head, still rocking \n\tas if just dropped. OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Norman's \n\tfootsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse \n\tof him going out into the office, almost at a run.\n\n\tINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila is on the top step, looking down toward CAMERA.\n\n\tShe is listening, hoping to hear some human sound, some sound \n\tshe might follow, pursue. She hears nothing. She starts down \n\tthe stairs. Just below the halfway step, she looks at the \n\tfront door, sees out through the door window:\n\n\tLILA'S VIEWPOINT - (DAY)\n\n\tNorman coming.\n\n\tINT. STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tFor a moment Lila panics, then she hurries down the steps, \n\tcannot go in the direction of the front door, remembers the \n\tstairway behind her, turns and runs in that direction. The \n\tSOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard. \n\tLila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the \n\tbasement, going down far enough to conceal herself, crouching \n\tthere.\n\n\tNorman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens. \n\tHe glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He \n\tseems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes \n\tfrom his face, and he appears to enter a no-place, no-time \n\tstate. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.\n\n\tLila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to \n\tthe SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed \n\tby the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an \n\tupstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs \n\tfor her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the \n\tsteps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is \n\tcaught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses, \n\tlooks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the \n\tnot entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving \n\tSOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.\n\n\tLila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while \n\tshe has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check \n\tthat hidden-looking room down below, a room in which, she \n\tdesperately believes, there must lie some answer to what \n\thappened to Mary. She turns and goes softly and quickly down \n\tthe stairs.\n\n\tINT. THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)\n\n\tLila reaches the bottom, stops, listens, hears the stairboards \n\tcreaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them. She \n\tturns, pulls open the fruit cellar door, looks in. The woman \n\tis sitting in a comfortable chair, the back of the chair, \n\tand the woman, turned to the door. Lila calls a harsh, \n\tfrightened whisper.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tMrs. Bates...?\n\n\tLila goes into the room.\n\n\tINT. THE FRUIT CELLAR\n\n\tLila goes to the chair, touches it. The touch disturbs the \n\tfigure. It starts to turn, slowly, stiffly, a clock-wise \n\tmovement. Lila looks at it in horror. It is the body of a \n\twoman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the \n\tmouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.  \n\tThe eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose \n\thas collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are \n\tsunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and \n\tflaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed \n\tdress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.\n\n\tThe movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning \n\tas if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually \n\tgraceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.\n\n\tLila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment, then begins \n\tto scream, a high, piercing, dreadful scream.\n\n\tAnd Lila's scream is joined by another scream, a more \n\tdreadful, horrifying scream which comes from the door behind \n\ther.\n\n\t\t\t\tNORMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(screaming)\n\t\tAyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma \n\t\tBates!\n\n\tLila turns.\n\n\tNORMAN\n\n\tHis face is contorted. He wears a wild wig, a mockery of a \n\twoman's hair. He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is \n\tsimilar to that worn by the corpse of his mother. His hand \n\tis raised high, poised to strike at Lila. There is a long \n\tbreadknife in it.\n\n\tLILA\n\n\tClose on her face. She is dumb-struck. Her eyes are screaming.\n\n\tBACK TO NORMAN\n\n\tAs he is about to start forward, a man's hand reaches in \n\tfrom the doorway behind, grabs Norman's wrist. Sam comes \n\tthrough the door, still holding tight to the wrist, pulling \n\tback the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman, \n\tfootball tackle style.\n\n\tSERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT\n\n\tNorman and Sam, struggling. The wild fury in Norman's face, \n\tthe mad noise of his screams and vile curses. The terrified, \n\tfight-to-the-death look of Sam. The still, staring Lila.\n\n\tMRS. BATES\n\n\tA close of her face, She appears to be watching and enjoying \n\tthe fight. Over the shot, the SOUNDS of the struggle, the \n\tscreams of Norman.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\tEXT. COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)\n\n\tThere are many people gathered about the steps, the curious \n\tand the concerned and the morbid. At the curb, a couple of \n\tnewspaper cars, two or three police cars, and a mobile unit \n\ttruck from the local television outlet. There is noise, and \n\tchattering as questions are asked and answers given, and the \n\tsounds of traffic, and of the television equipment being \n\tmoved into the courthouse, for on-the-scene reporting, and \n\tthe stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back. \n\tThe scene has a bright glare about it, that quality of sudden \n\tlight thrown on a fearful darkness.\n\n\tCLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE\n\n\tA POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men, \n\tmuttering \"keep back,\" etc., to the spectators. A TELEVISION \n\tMAN, carrying a piece of equipment goes through door, and \n\tCAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule.\n\n\tHere, too, there is a crowd, composed of Policemen, Reporters, \n\tTelevision Men. The Television Men we have been following \n\tstops beside a Policeman.\n\n\t\t\t\tTELEVISION MAN\n\t\t\t(Indicating the front \n\t\t\tdoor he has just \n\t\t\tcome in through)\n\t\tYou think they'll take him out that \n\t\tway?\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICEMAN\n\t\t\t(Looking at waiting \n\t\t\tcrowd, shrugging)\n\t\tProbably have to.\n\t\t\t(A rueful smile)\n\t\tBesides, the taxpayers hate it when \n\t\tsomething gets slipped out the back \n\t\tdoor on them!\n\n\tOver this exchange, the buzz of other voices, the movement \n\tof men. CAMERA MOVES ON, down the corridor, gets to the door \n\tof the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow \n\twith a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-\n\tfor coffee reaches this door. CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY \n\tpauses a moment, then goes into the room.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)\n\n\tLila is seated in a chair, Sam standing close by. A bit apart \n\tfrom them, we see Sheriff Chambers, in quiet conference with \n\tthe CHIEF OF POLICE, the COUNTY SHERIFF, the DISTRICT \n\tATTORNEY.\n\n\tThe Coffee Boy stands in the doorway. Sam goes to him, takes \n\ta container of coffee from the box, carries it to Lila, \n\tchecking the notation on the lid as he goes.\n\n\tMED. CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(quietly)\n\t\tIt's regular. Okay?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\t\t(ruefully)\n\t\tI could stand something regular.\n\n\tSam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. Sheriff \n\tChambers ENTERS SHOT, gives Sam a container of coffee he has \n\tbrought for him. Sam takes it, nods a thank you.\n\n\tFor a moment no one speaks. Lila looks badly shaken, Sam \n\tdisheveled, but contained.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHAMBERS\n\t\tYou two can go on home if you like.\n\t\t\t(a sympathetic look \n\t\t\tat Lila)\n\t\tMaking that statement was enough for \n\t\tone night.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\t\t(to Lila)\n\t\tWant to?\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tNo. I'm all right. I'll feel better \n\t\twhen all this is explained... if it \n\t\tcan be.\n\n\tSam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers. Chambers shrugs \n\tdoubtfully.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHAMBERS\n\t\tIf anybody gets any answers, it'll \n\t\tbe the fellow talking to him now... \n\t\tthe Psychiatrist. Even I couldn't \n\t\treach Norman... and he knows me.\n\t\t\t(to Lila)\n\t\tYou warm enough, Miss?\n\n\tLila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the \n\troom and rises anxiously. Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn, \n\tfollow her gaze.\n\n\tINT. OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT\n\n\tA young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into \n\tthe room. He is DR. SIMON, the Psychiatrist.\n\n\tHe goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has \n\tbeen placed, takes up a container.\n\n\t\t\t\tDISTRICT ATTORNEY\n\t\tDid he talk to you?\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tNo. I got the whole story... but not \n\t\tfrom Norman. I got it from... his \n\t\tmother.\n\n\tEveryone gazes at him, mystified. He speaks as he removes \n\tlid from coffee container.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tNorman Bates no longer exists. He \n\t\tonly half-existed to begin with...  \n\t\tnow, the other half has taken over.  \n\t\tProbably for all time.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\t\t(With difficulty)\n\t\tDid he kill my sister?\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tYes... and no.\n\n\t\t\t\tDISTRICT ATTORNEY\n\t\tLook, if you're trying to lay a lot \n\t\tof psychiatric groundwork for some \n\t\tsort of plea this fellow would like \n\t\tto cop...\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tA psychiatrist doesn't lay the \n\t\tgroundwork .. he merely tries to \n\t\texplain it.\n\n\t\t\t\tLILA\n\t\tBut my sister is...\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tYes. I'm sorry.\n\t\t\t(to Chambers)\n\t\tThe Private Investigator, too. If \n\t\tyou drag that swamp somewhere in the \n\t\tvicinity of the motel...\n\t\t\t(To the Chief of Police)\n\t\tHave you any unsolved missing persons \n\t\tcases on your books?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF OF POLICE\n\t\tYes. Two.\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tYoung girls?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHIEF OF POLICE\n\t\t\t(nods, astounded, \n\t\t\tthen:)\n\t\tDid he confess to...\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\t\t(interrupting)\n\t\tAs I said, the mother...\n\t\t\t(Pauses, goes on afresh)\n\t\tTo understand it, as I understood it \n\t\thearing it from the mother...  That \n\t\tis, from the mother-half of Norman's \n\t\tmind, you have to go back ten years... \n\t\tto the time when Norman murdered his \n\t\tmother and her lover.\n\t\t\t(A pause, then as no \n\t\t\tone interrupts)\n\t\tHe was already dangerously disturbed, \n\t\thad been ever since his father died. \n\t\tHis mother was a clinging, demanding \n\t\twoman... and for years the two of \n\t\tthem lived as if there was no one \n\t\telse in the world. Then she met a \n\t\tman and it seemed to Norman she \"threw \n\t\thim over\" for this man. That pushed \n\t\thim over the thin line... and he \n\t\tkilled them both. Matricide is \n\t\tprobably the most unbearable crime \n\t\tof all... and most unbearable to the \n\t\tson who commit it. So he had to erase \n\t\tthe crime, at least in his own mind.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tHe stole her corpse... and a weighted \n\t\tcoffin was buried. He hid the body \n\t\tin the fruit cellar, even \"treated\" \n\t\tit to keep it as well as it would \n\t\tkeep. And that still wasn't enough. \n\t\tShe was there, but she was a corpse.  \n\t\tSo he began to think and speak for \n\t\ther, gave her half his life, so to \n\t\tspeak. At times he could be both \n\t\tpersonalities, carry on \n\t\tconversations... at other times, the \n\t\tmother-half took over completely. He \n\t\twas never all Norman, but he was \n\t\toften only mother. And because he \n\t\twas so pathologically jealous of \n\t\ther, he assumed she was as jealous \n\t\tof him. Therefore, if he felt a strong \n\t\tattraction to any other woman, the \n\t\tmother side of him would go wild.\n\t\t\t(To Lila)\n\t\tWhen Norman met your sister, he was \n\t\ttouched by her... and aroused by \n\t\ther. He wanted her. And this set off \n\t\this \"jealous mother\" and...  \"mother \n\t\tkilled the girl.\" After the murder, \n\t\tNorman returned as if from a deep \n\t\tsleep... and like a dutiful son, \n\t\tcovered up all traces of the crime \n\t\the was convinced his mother had \n\t\tcommitted.\n\n\t\t\t\tSAM\n\t\tWhy was he... dressed like that?\n\n\t\t\t\tDISTRICT ATTORNEY\n\t\tHe's a transvestite!\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tNot exactly. A man who dresses in \n\t\twoman's clothing in order to achieve \n\t\ta sexual change... or satisfaction... \n\t\tis a transvestite.  But in Norman's \n\t\tcase, he was simply doing everything \n\t\tpossible to keep alive the illusion \n\t\tof his mother being alive. And \n\t\twhenever reality came too close, \n\t\twhen danger or desire threatened \n\t\tthat illusion, he'd dress up, even \n\t\tto a cheap wig he brought, and he'd \n\t\twalk about the house, sit in her \n\t\tchair, speak in her voice... He tried \n\t\tto be his mother.\n\t\t\t(A sad smile)\n\t\tAnd now he is.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tThat's what I meant when I said I \n\t\tgot the story from the mother. She \n\t\tthinks Norman has been taken away... \n\t\tbecause of his crimes.  She insists \n\t\tshe did nothing, that Norman committed \n\t\tall the murders just to keep her \n\t\tfrom being discovered. She even smiled \n\t\ta bit coquettishly as she said that. \n\t\tOf course, she feels badly about \n\t\tit... but also somewhat relieved to \n\t\tbe, as she put it, free of Norman, \n\t\tat last.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tWhen the mind houses two \n\t\tpersonalities, there is always a \n\t\tbattle. In Norman's case, the battle \n\t\tis over... and the dominant \n\t\tpersonality has won.\n\n\tLila begins to weep softly, for Mary, for Arbogast, for \n\tNorman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. \n\tSam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHAMBERS\n\t\t\t(To Simon)\n\t\tAnd the forty thousand dollars?  Who \n\t\tgot that?\n\n\t\t\t\tSIMON\n\t\tThe swamp. These were murders of \n\t\tpassion, not profit.\n\n\tA POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near-\n\twhisper, to the Chief of Police. The Guard is carrying a \n\tfolded blanket over his arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tPOLICE GUARD\n\t\tHe feels a little chill... can I \n\t\tbring him this blanket?\n\n\tThe Chief of Police nods. The Guard goes away, and CAMERA \n\tFOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway. Guard \n\tmoves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE\n\n\tA narrower corridor in the rear of the building. In f.g. of \n\tshot, we see a door, the top half of which is wire-covered \n\tglass. A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door, looking \n\treprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance \n\tinto the room.\n\n\tThe Police Guard, carrying the blanket, comes down this \n\tcorridor, goes to the door. CAMERA MOVES CLOSE. The uniformed \n\tGuard opens the door, allows the man to go in.\n\n\tShot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room.\n\n\tAfter a moment, the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard \n\tcloses and locks the door and we\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t CUT TO:\n\n\tINT. NORMAN'S DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)\n\n\tThe walls are white and plain. There is no window.\n\n\tThere is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which \n\tNorman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality \n\tof no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.\n\n\tThe Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees. \n\tNorman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding \n\tit. His face, although without makeup and without the \n\tsurrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity \n\tabout it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch \n\twomanliness about the brows.\n\n\tCalmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if \n\tit were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so \n\tthat our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in \n\tposition, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the \n\tvoice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER'S VOICE (O.S.)\n\t\tIt's sad... when a mother has to \n\t\tspeak the words that condemn her own \n\t\tson... but I couldn't allow them to \n\t\tbelieve that I would commit murder.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tThey'll put him away now... as I \n\t\tshould have... years ago. He was \n\t\talways... bad. And in the end, he \n\t\tintended to tell them I killed those \n\t\tgirls... and that man. As if I could \n\t\tdo anything except just sit and \n\t\tstare... like one of his stuffed \n\t\tbirds.\n\t\t\t(A pause)\n\t\tWell, they know I can't even move a \n\t\tfinger. And I won't. I'll just sit \n\t\there and be quiet. Just in case they \n\t\tdo... suspect me.\n\n\tA fly buzzes close, and then continues buzzing and flying \n\tabout Norman's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMOTHER'S VOICE (V.O.)\n\t\tThey're probably watching me.  Well, \n\t\tlet them. Let them see what kind of \n\t\ta person I am.\n\t\t\t(A pause, as the fly \n\t\t\tlights on Norman's \n\t\t\thand)\n\t\tI'm not going to swat that fly. I \n\t\thope they are watching. They'll see... \n\t\tthey'll see... and they'll know... \n\t\tand they'll say... 'why, she wouldn't \n\t\teven harm a fly...'\n\n\tNorman continues to gaze ahead into nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO:\n\n\tTHE SWAMP\n\n\tAs END TITLES FADE IN, we see the swamp, the chain of a tow-\n\ttruck. The chain is attached to Mary's car. The car is coming \n\tout of the swamp.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFADE OUT\n\n\t\t\t\t\t THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPsycho\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Robert Bloch\u00a0\u00a0Joseph Stefano\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:33:24.582010"}
