We emerge to find ourselves gliding above a\n               small town.  Descending lower.  And lower.  To Xenia, Ohio.\n\n                                   TED (V.O.)\n                         ...But a lot of clich\u00e9s get to be\n                         clich\u00e9s because they're true.

You're not even totally\n                         sure WHAT you wannabe...\n\n               We pass over the town square. A fine spring day in middle\n               America. Red brick buildings with names like \"Miller & Son\n               Drugs,\" \"Two Sisters Gifts,\" \"Nelson Family Market.\"   You\n               can almost smell the rosy cheeks and moral fiber.\n\n                                   TED (V.O.)

I'm over here.  \n\n               We SWISH PAN to another teenager, locking his bike.  Meet our\n               much less glamorous hero:  TED NELSON, 17.  A decent looking\n               kid.  Not hip enough to be cool.  Not square enough to be\n               tormented. He joins the other KIDS heading into the school.\n\n                                   TED (V.O.)

Also in SLOW MO.\n               Which makes even her most mundane task seem graceful. Wow,\n               just look at her stack those books. \n\n                                   TED (V.O.)\n                         That's Christy Malone.

Immediately!\n\n               PRINCIPAL RICHARD MERKIN, mid-50's, marches down the hallway,\n               seizing copies of \"EXPOSED!\" from students' hands. We can see\n               that it is a \"homemade\" looking newspaper. And there's\n               obviously much ado about it.  Christy winks at Ted as she\n               hides the newspaper in her locker.  \n\n               FREEZE FRAME ON Christy, WINKING.\n\n                                   TED (V.O.)\n                         Look at that smile.  That wink.\n                         That's no platonic wink. That's a\n                         wink that says, \"I don't just want\n                         you, Ted. I NEED you.\" So of course\n                         I had to ask her to the prom. I\n                         mean, she was practically begging\n                         for it.\n\n               INT.

She\n               whispers to another CHEERLEADER.  They giggle.  Then Christy\n               turns to Ted.

TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING\n\n               A beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school\n               parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their\n               way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up.\n\n               Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the\n               school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a\n               grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a\n               pattern of white billowy clouds.\n\n               The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking\n               seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his\n               stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and\n               stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first\n               into the grass.\n\n               Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely\n               Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful\n               blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see. \n\n               Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin\n               bursts through the front doors, shouting...\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         You cannot land a helicopter in my\n                         school yard! Get that blasted thing\n                         out of here!\n\n               Ted raises his hand.  The chopper rises as if on cue. \n               Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal\n               Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround\n               Ted.  Congratulating him.  Everyone wanting to be Ted's new\n               best friend.

Principal Merkin gives the Mayor\n               a hard look.  Merkin's face contorts in SLOW MO as he\n               proclaims...\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         I. AM. THAT. MAN.\n\n               INT. CITY BUILDING CORRIDOR - SAME TIME\n\n               Holding a stack of flyers, Charlie chats with Judy, Merkin's\n               college-aged daughter.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         You're like a centerfold waiting to\n                         happen. And let me assure you, I\n                         have some serious pull with the\n                         publisher.\n\n               Judy smiles fetchingly. Stashing Charlie's \"Heaven\" flyer in\n               her backpack. Her father suddenly appears.\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         What the hell are you doing?\n\n                                   JUDY\n                         I'm an adult.

As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy\n               smiles back at Charlie.  He winks.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         Send us a picture, sugar.  We'll\n                         get back to you.\n\n               The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the\n               ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters\n               the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers.\n\n               EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY\n\n               A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes\n               around the block and into a doorway.  The women are dressed\n               to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his\n               convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads\n               for the door.\n\n               INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               We follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of\n               women, towards an office.\n\n                                   TED\n                             (greeting the women)\n                         Hello there...Looking great...Very\n                         nice.\n\n               Charlie looks frazzled.\n\n                                   CHARLIE\n                         You're late, bro!\n\n                                   TED\n                         Sorry.

TED'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat\n               screen hangs on the wall.   A high tech computer system for\n               video conferences dominates the room.  Ted speaks with Uncle\n               Billy and Helen.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         So far, so good.

You have your father's\n                         impeccable judgment.\n\n               Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops.\n\n                                   TED\n                         My father must've been amazing.\n\n                                   UNCLE BILLY\n                         He was in a league of his own.\n\n               Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         Sorry I--\n\n                                   TED\n                         It's okay.

Gives it a cursory glance. Nods to his\n               dad, as if dismissing him.\n\n                                   TED\n                         No problem, consider it done.\n                             (to Uncle Billy)\n                         I had this idea of shooting on\n                         location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe\n                         at some famous Xenia landmarks. \n                         You think that would be a problem?\n\n                                   HELEN\n                         We'll send you the release forms,\n                         Ted.

Don't you forget\n                         it, Ted-baby.\n\n               Ted laughs. Completely ignoring his dad. Who backs out of the\n               room. Unnoticed. Neglected. Hurt.\n\n               EXT. THE NELSON HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Mom drives up to the house.  She stares, aghast.\n\n               There are tall, beautiful, ANGELS everywhere.  One cuts the\n               grass.  Another pulls weeds. Two others on the roof, cleaning\n               gutters.\n               Still others wash the car...with Jimmy handling the water\n               hose. Drenching the women, more than the car. Shrieks and\n               giggles all around. Neighbors gawk.\n\n               Ted's dad guiltily enjoys the view, but quickly rushes to his\n               wife. She gets out of her car and steadies herself on his\n               arm. \n\n               INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Ted stands on an ottoman as a TAILOR fits him for a prom\n               tuxedo. He towers over his parents who try to talk to him. We\n               feel for them. They've lost control of their kid.\n\n                                   MOM\n                         You have to understand. This was a\n                         big shock, for all of us.

We\n                         don't approve of the magazine or\n                         the models or the so-called \"flesh\n                         parties\" you attend. But we can get\n                         past all that.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         We miss you.

What\n                         more do you want from me?\n\n               Dad glances at Mom, hesitant.  She nods, giving him the\n               courage to continue.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         We think you should give up the\n                         magazine. Sell it. Let someone else\n                         run it. Whatever it takes.\n\n                                   MOM\n                         We want you to go to college, find\n                         a career you love, marry a nice\n                         girl from a nice family, and live\n                         happily ever after.\n\n               Ted laughs.\n\n                                   TED\n                         THAT is your dream, not mine. My\n                         dream is so far beyond anything YOU\n                         PEOPLE could even imagine.\n\n                                   DAD\n                         Watch your tone, mister.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Why don't you just admit what this\n                         is really all about? I'm not your\n                         real kid and you can't control me\n                         anymore.\n\n               Mom and Dad look stricken.

No wonder\n                         I hated this one-horse cow town. I\n                         come from talented people who took\n                         chances and dared to imagine a life\n                         without limits! I was never meant\n                         to be raised by...GROCERS.\n\n               Ted storms away, unintentionally CRASHING into a TREASURED\n               FAMILY PHOTO on the end table. The frame shatters into\n               smithereens. Breaking Mom and Dad's hearts. STUNNED SILENCE\n               hangs heavy in the room. \n\n               INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT\n\n               Prom night.  Couples slow dance to a Marilyn Manson clone,\n               singing a rock version of \"Precious and Few.\"\n\n               Principal Merkin watches on the sidelines.  Surprisingly\n               calm. Suspiciously happy.\n\n               Ted caresses Ginger's bare back as they dance together. His\n               head nestled against her breasts. Not a care in the world. \n               He spots Charlie on the dance floor. Making out with one of\n               his dates, the IDENTICAL TAYLOR TRIPLETS, while the other two\n               patiently wait their turn.\n\n                                   GINGER\n                         Teddy?

Ted glances down, where...\n\n               Hundreds of binoculars, cameras, and camcorders are poised on\n               the scene.  Men of all ages are milling around, gawking,\n               focusing their long lenses.  Women are conspicuously absent. \n               Except for the gaggle of hardcore FEMINISTS with their\n               placards, denouncing \"Heaven.\"\n\n               One Feminist approaches the Mayor.\n\n                                   FEMINIST\n                         The city tower belongs to the city,\n                         not to some pornographer.\n\n                                   MAYOR\n                         The library also belongs to the\n                         city.  And guess what?  It's going\n                         to have a new Ted Nelson wing with \n                         three thousand children's books.\n\n               The Feminist tries to respond, but a helicopter swoops\n               overhead, drowning out her words. The helicopter rises to the\n               level of the photo shoot where the door slides open.  And\n               just when we think it must have been hired by some hard core\n               fans who wanted a closer look, we find Principal Merkin\n               frowning as he barks through a bullhorn.\n\n                                   PRINCIPAL MERKIN\n                         You should be ashamed, young lady! \n                         Your body is a sacred temple!\n\n               Molly flashes him. Principal Merkin averts his eyes.  Missing\n               the sight of Molly's dress being blown off her body by the\n               chopper's prop wash.  The spectators below APPLAUD.

And doing a mighty fine job of it.\n\n               Ted pulls out his camera and fires away. Blinded by the stage\n               lights, Principal Merkin sings and vogues glamorously.

Their\n               clothes are drenched, but they couldn't care less.

He then peers into the...\n\n               SHOWER\n\n               Where Christy Malone limbers up.  Stretching her leg against\n               the wall.

She resumes posing. Flashing a bare\n               shoulder.  A coy look. She doesn't need direction. She's a\n               natural.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         Remember dress up day?

She's wearing only panties the size of a\n               Band-aid. Ted is mute. Staring at her perfect body.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         Well? \n\n                                   TED\n                         You have changed since second\n                         grade.\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         I mean, what do you think?\n\n                                   TED\n                         You expect me to think at a time\n                         like this?

Out of Christy's sight, he\n               squirms in his jeans. Trying to hide his enthusiasm.\n\n               MUSIC suddenly seems to come from nowhere. Nine Inch Nails.\n               \"I Want to Fuck You Like An Animal.\"\n\n                                   TED\n                             (sotto)\n                         God help me.\n\n               Ted steps back into the shower.

Wanna to do the other one?\n\n               She tosses him the ice cube. He fumbles. It lands on the\n               floor.\n\n                                   TED\n                         You're doing just fine, Christy.\n                         Believe me.\n\n                                   CHRITY\n                         Then I'm ready when you are.\n\n               Ted looks through the lens. We can see him trembling.  Music\n               blasts as Ted's camera burns through film.  They're both\n               getting into it.  Water pulsating over her body. Steam\n               rising.  Christy begins lathering her breasts.\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         I was always too shy to admit how\n                         much I liked you.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Come on, I was hamburger.

But inside,\n                         deep down, I've always been\n                         dripping with special sauces. \n                             (she smiles, sexily)\n                         Are you hungry?\n\n               Is he hungry. He's been working up this appetite for ten\n               years. He can barely contain himself.\n\n                                   TED\n                         God, you are so hot. \n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         Then you better get in the water,\n                         before you get burned. \n\n               Ted calls her bluff. He sets aside his camera. Walks right\n               into the water. Through the steam.  Toward Christy. She wraps\n               a leg around him, sucking face, wanting more.\n\n                                   CHRISTY (CONT'D)\n                         You and me, finally. This will be\n                         so fantastic, Teddy Bear. Trust me.\n\n               Suddenly Ted stops. Remembering what Julie said about trust. \n\n                                   TED\n                         I'm sorry, Christy.

Wrapping her hands around his waist. Caressing his\n               chest, his stomach...\n\n                                   CHRISTY\n                         Sure you can.

Rolling on the\n               floor. Hands, arms, lips, tongues, all in motion. As the\n               shower drenches them.\n\n               Suddenly, they roll into a pair of legs.  Both look up.  The\n               steam clears to reveal Julie. Arms crossed. Hurt, but not\n               surprised. \n\n                                   JULIE\n                         What's up, doc?\n\n               She doesn't wait for an explanation.

TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n               Julie dashes out of the girls' locker room, passing a\n               JANITOR.  Ted follows, dripping water.\n\n                                   JANITOR\n                         I'm sorry, Mr. Ted.

Ted stops at the door. \n               Then realizes there is no one else around.  He heads inside.\n\n               INT. GIRLS' RESTROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n               Julie's too proud to let him see her cry. But we can tell\n               she's upset.\n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Go away, Ted. Just go.\n\n               Ted corners her near a row of sinks.\n\n                                   TED\n                         Please believe me. It was just a\n                         kiss for old time's sake. I've had\n                         a stupid crush on her since I was\n                         seven, but I never got closer to\n                         her than four feet and then there\n                         she was right in front of me,\n                         completely naked.\n\n               Julie looks at him, pensively. She unzips the back of her\n               summery dress. And lets it fall to the floor. She's\n               completely naked and absolutely gorgeous.\n\n               Ted gasps. He's been around dozens of naked women by now, but\n               this one he can't just gawk at. This one he really cares\n               about. \n\n                                   JULIE\n                         Being naked is no big deal. It has\n                         nothing to do with emotion, nothing\n                         to do with love. You can be around\n                         all the naked girls you want and\n                         you won't be even one step closer\n                         to anything meaningful in your\n                         life.\n\n               She puts on her dress, gracefully. As if nothing happened.\n\n                                   JULIE (CONT'D)\n                         See that?

Julie walks away,\n               leaving Ted completely alone.

Grandpa\n                         knew the right thing to say in\n                         every situation, and it usually\n                         involved peaches.
