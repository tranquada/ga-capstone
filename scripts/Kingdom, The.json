The 8yo leans his weight into an\n    old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his\n    Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient\n    left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to\n    left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There\n    is no God but Allah.\n\n    The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the\n    head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his\n    face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to\n    them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that\n    toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security\n    Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of\n    compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision,\n    most of which we can see from this high up.\n\n    The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on\n    the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal\n    monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.\n\n    Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now...\n    Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from\n    his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a\n    softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced\n    walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the\n    only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.\n\n\n<b>8   OMITTED                                                        8\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   6.\n</b>\n\n\n\n<b>9    EXT.

Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you\n     get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to\n     slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements\n     flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles\n     if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift-\n     gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.\n\n     SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern\n     Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his\n     uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows\n     queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly\n     White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat\n     in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom\n     of the Rover.\n\n     A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:\n\n<b>                         DRIVER\n</b>               How are you today, Sergeant?\n\n<b>                         HAYTHAM\n</b>               Sun is shining.
