AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                             7\n\n    A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented-\n    canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and\n    his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an\n    old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his\n    Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient\n    left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to\n    left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There\n    is no God but Allah.\n\n    The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the\n    head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his\n    face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to\n    them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that\n    toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security\n    Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of\n    compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision,\n    most of which we can see from this high up.\n\n    The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on\n    the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal\n    monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.\n\n    Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now...\n    Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from\n    his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a\n    softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced\n    walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the\n    only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.\n\n\n8   OMITTED                                                        8\n\n                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   6.\n\n\n\n\n9    EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY                          9\n\n     Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the\n     walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you\n     get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to\n     slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements\n     flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles\n     if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift-\n     gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.\n\n     SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern\n     Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his\n     uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows\n     queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly\n     White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat\n     in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom\n     of the Rover.\n\n     A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:\n\n                         DRIVER\n               How are you today, Sergeant?\n\n                         HAYTHAM\n               Sun is shining.

Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away,\n     navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.\n\n\n10   INT.

Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco\n     homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks,\n     concrete and rock where grass should be.\n\n     The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top\n     sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser\n     parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security.\n     Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.\n\n                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   7.\n\n\n\n\n11   EXT.

More muted cheers float. Behind\n     and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his\n     32 year-old Son, in Arabic:\n\n                         GRANDFATHER (O.C.)\n               Hang up the phone.

We see his\n     Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move\n     to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see\n     what's about to happen.

The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like\n     professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump\n     in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center\n     console.

Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can,\n     shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest\n     with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...\n\n\n19   EXT.

Then we see the\n     Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his\n     youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple:\n     making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The\n     Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger.\n\n                                              KINGDOM 8/18/06   10.\n\n\n\n\n20   EXT.

The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now\n     realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something\n     else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had\n     gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away...\n\n     The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger,\n     vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue-\n     black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate\n     surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the\n     light standards surrounding the field and parking lot.\n\n\n21   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT             21\n\n     Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of\n     four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and\n     shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind\n     it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a\n     blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified\n     yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in\n     the nearby parking lot.\n\n\n22   EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT              22\n\n     The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African-\n     American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates,\n     her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's\n     breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine\n     reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the\n     14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion\n     that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another\n     desperate to escape.\n\n\n23   EXT.

Stops\n     near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man\n     with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank\n     staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt.

The Passenger is launched out his\n     window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke-\n     screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision.\n\n     Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second\n     Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the\n     jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking\n     all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a\n     groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip\n     into the interior while walking along side.\n\n     The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the\n     Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely,\n     screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.\n\n\n26   EXT.

Acrid smoke.\n\n     FRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of\n     American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military\n     whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G-\n     shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain.\n\n     Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the\n     frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights\n     that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of\n     black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men.\n     Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking\n     lot. Fran has to do something/anything.\n\n     Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his\n     face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team\n     pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover.\n     She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in.\n\n     She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.

Leaves\n     the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until\n     he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams\n     reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the\n     woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes\n     come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed\n     with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.\n\n                         VOICE (O.C.)\n                   (immediately behind)\n               Fran.

He and Rex step to\n     a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of\n     coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the\n     proximity.

Five times the size of the suicide\n     bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment\n     buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is\n     crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown\n     into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get\n     decimated.\n\n\n29   EXT.

After\n          speaking with Thamer, I advised we\n          withhold additional US personnel\n          because a big part of the religious\n          justification for these bombs is\n          the presence of current US\n          personnel.

I'm sure things were\n               somewhat over-stated. I see myself\n               as friend of Saudi Arabia.

First:\n               The FBI with the White House go on\n               the kind of aggressive PR \"Saudi\n               Royal Family Decaying Monarchy\"\n               bender that just can't help but\n               hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care\n               how many Chinese are lined up to\n               buy the oil.

Then what gets kind of not-\n          funny is how some of that cash\n          found its way to Jakarta and some\n          Mosques that have these training\n          camps built right next to them.\n          It's kinda funny... you got little\n          kids playing over here, and some\n          not so little kids playing with\n          guns over here. That's kinda odd.\n\n                    PRINCE THAMER\n          You have no proof of this.\n\n                    RONALD FLEURY\n          We're getting there, Sir.

His Father readies himself --\n     stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the\n     black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his\n     Son's cheek.

Different\ndefinitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin\nKhaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet\nlast: the pictures suddenly stop.

We immediately notice the right hand\n      is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert\n      bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of\n      detonating-wire emanating from each cap.\n\n      Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours\n      a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks,\n      marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent\n      densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the\n      floor.

Loud AK-47 bursts from inside\n      now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound\n      and yellow-white flash past two windows.

An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug-\n      shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on\n      respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer\n      takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House:\n      engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All\n      of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure.\n\n      Al-Ghazi appears from the back of the house.

LAND ROVER - SAME MOMENT                             125\n\n      Haytham scanning as he drives: straining to see the plume\n      from the second attacking vehicle way ahead, blending with\n      other fleeing, scared motorists. We watch as the distant\n      plume cuts hard left, at a high rate of speed... then\n      DISAPPEARS.\n\n\n126   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                           126\n\n      Quiet. The 32 year-old son we met on the rooftop is on his\n      cell phone again, speed-assembling an ancient VHS camera atop\n      a tri-pod.\n\n                          THE SON\n                    (in Arabic, frantic)\n                DO NOT COME HERE!\n\n      Intercut with the Mercedes Driver yelling frantic into his\n      cell phone:\n\n                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   121.\n\n\n\n                          MERCEDES DRIVER\n                    (Arabic)\n                He's been shot! BE READY.\n\n      Back in the room, A HUGE MAN dressed in paramilitary black,\n      face wrapped in his shumagh, so only the eyes are visible,\n      stands in front of a sheet hung from the ceiling, quietly\n      practicing/reading a speech for an imaginary audience. Lots\n      of gesticulating and head movement.\n\n      The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band.\n\n      Door BURSTS open, bottom hinge rips from the jamb. Leavitt is\n      slammed to the ground. Passport Officer shoves the practicing\n      Speaker out of the way- Turns to the wide-eyed 32 year-old.\n\n                          PASSPORT OFFICER\n                NOW. HURRY.\n\n      Leavitt's face already swollen-black-bleeding, scanning the\n      room with terrified fury in his eyes. He sees the handle of\n      the knife sticking from the Huge Man's waistband. His tears\n      leak all at once.\n\n      The Officer takes the knife, turns to Leavitt: dirty 11-inch\n      blade...\n\n\n127   INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT                              127\n\n      Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail\n      they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he\n      sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit,\n      decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard,\n      fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window,\n      starring it.\n\n      They're being lead into Riyadh's most hostile neighborhood.\n\n                          AL-GHAZI\n                We should not be here...\n\n      JANET'S POV: scanning for the trail Suburban and the Mercedes\n      - she can't help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an\n      intersection, Fleury yells:\n\n                          RONALD FLEURY\n                BRAKES-REVERSE-TO THE RIGHT...\n\n      Haytham brakes, reverses: the Suburban.\n\n                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   122.\n\n\n\n\n128   INT. LAND CRUISER / EXT. SUWEIDI - NEXT MOMENT            128\n\n      Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street,\n      surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS\n      huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.\n\n      A second passes: these people know where the attackers went.\n      Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly\n      just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his\n      back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past\n      on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the\n      little boy was nodding a warning-\n\n      What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:\n\n                          GRANT SYKES\n                -GET OUT OF-\n\n      -big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse\n      and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield\n      bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles\n      bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the\n      dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor\n      panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.\n\n      A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE\n      thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off\n      the roof and into the Land Cruiser.\n\n      Frantic, Fleury swats it out.\n\n      The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel\n      into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of\n      shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4:\n      returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and\n      all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds\n      everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle:\n      firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who\n      were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.\n\n\n129   EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT                               129\n\n      A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white-\n      black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face\n      backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what\n      else.\n\n      Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge,\n      firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting\n      a fire-cracker.\n\n                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   123.\n\n\n      We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of\n      blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's\n      head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never\n      stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on\n      reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he\n      disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun.\n      Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for\n      eternity.\n\n      Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic\n      Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the\n      riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from\n      the doorway.\n\n\n130   EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           130\n\n      Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown\n      now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks\n      Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head.\n\n      Janet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover.\n\n      From the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground.\n\n                          FLEURY (O.C.)\n                I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES...

A\n      puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor.\n      Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some\n      in traditional dress, starting to mass.\n\n                          FLEURY\n                MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK!\n\n      He drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just\n      killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the\n      backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down.\n\n\n132   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                             132\n\n      Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old,\n      hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri-\n      pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted\n      at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready.\n\n                                            KINGDOM 8/18/06   124.\n\n\n      We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway.\n      Passport Officer barks something back.\n\n      The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's\n      head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of\n      neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in\n      place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.\n\n                          DRIVER\n                READY?\n\n      Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his\n      last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera,\n      trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it\n      as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground,\n      battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin\n      hammering Adam.\n\n                          PASSPORT OFFICER (O.C.)\n                    (in Arabic)\n                GOD DAMN HIM!\n\n      32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach\n      the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and\n      snot and blood rage.\n\n\n133   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT                  133\n\n      Running down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher\n      poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood-\n      pool in front.\n\n                          RONALD FLEURY\n                RPG!\n\n      Empties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood\n      splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi\n      start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The\n      trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on\n      their asses for second and third times: dazed.\n\n      Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading,\n      how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a\n      grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly.\n      Bounces just on the third floor landing-\n\n\n134   INT. ENEMY APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT                          134\n\n      -RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the\n      reticle up to his eye.

Passport Officer vanishes. The\n      32 year-old and his camera are   blown through the Driver\n      waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.   Because Leavitt was held so\n      tight to the floor, he escapes   the worst of the blast. Still\n      fucked up.\n\n      Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year-\n      old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his\n      back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver\n      and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as\n      Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.\n\n\n135   EXT.

The\n      collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the\n      room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence\n      draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away.\n\n\n      TIGHT ON HAYTHAM:\n\n      Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family,\n      the defiance on the faces of these young souls.\n\n      Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks,\n      spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is\n      not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then\n      take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age,\n      never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:\n\n                          COLONEL AL-GHAZI                              \n                Is everyone alright?\n\n      Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw\n      earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds\n      her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds\n      her hand out: I can help you little one.\n\n      The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes:\n      okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's\n      eyes on her, piercing.\n\n                           COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    \n                    (to the little girl, in\n                     Arabic)\n                It's okay.\n\n                                      KINGDOM 8/18/06   129.\n\n\n\nLittle One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to\nher in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her\nlittle bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a\ngift for you.\n\nJanet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a\nmarble...\n\nAl-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things.\nImmediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER\nstaring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al-\nGhazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...\n\n                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    \n              (in Arabic)\n          Let me help you up, Old Man...\n\nThe old man nods a `no.'\n\n                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    \n              (in Arabic)\n          GIVE ME YOUR HANDS!\n\nAl-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al-\nGhazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing\nfingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his\neyes, lifts his chin with his hand.\n\n                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    \n              (dazed, starting to                                \n               realize)                                          \n          ...Hamza.                                              \n\nThe old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance.             \n\n                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D)                    \n          I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under\n          arrest.\n\nABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi.\n\n                    NASSAR\n          You are a traitor to your\n          country... a traitor to your God.\n\n                    COLONEL AL-GHAZI                             \n          I am no traitor to my God. You are.\n\nAl-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15\nyear-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM.\nEverybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the\nfloor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather\nwith him.\n\n                                             KINGDOM 8/18/06   130.\n\n\n      Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only\n      see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son...\n      not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:\n\n                          RONALD FLEURY\n                ...Don't...\n\n      The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger\n      again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims\n      it at the boy's chest.\n\n                          RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)\n                ...drop it, Son...please...\n\n      ...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough\n      to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half\n      something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his\n      hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking\n      shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another\n      round into the chamber.\n\n      Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.\n\n      Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's\n      fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the\n      old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing,\n      the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still\n      screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers\n      something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.                \n\n      TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying           \n      teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for    \n      his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in             \n      Haytham's eyes.                                                  \n\n      A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.\n\n      Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the\n      bleeding...\n\n      Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears\n      spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man,\n      back down to Al-Ghazi.\n\n      Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.\n\n                          RONALD FLEURY (CONT'D)\n                You got him.
