HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT\n\n     We move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages\n     outside.  THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant\n     windows.  in the center of the room lies an oak coffin.\n\n     Suddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past\n     the edge... and then the lid slams up!  Famed psychic CRISWELL\n     pops out.  Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming\n     eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair.  He intones,\n     with absolute conviction:\n\n                             CRISWELL\n               Greetings, my friend.  You are\n               interested in the unknown, the\n               mysterious, the unexplainable...\n               that is why you are here. So now,\n               for the first time, we are bringing\n               you the full story of what\n               happened...\n                       (extremely serious)\n               We are giving you all the evidence,\n               based only on the secret testimony\n               of the miserable souls who survived\n               this terrifying ordeal.  The\n               incidents, the places, my friend, we\n               cannot keep this a secret any longer.\n               Can your hearts stand the shocking\n               facts of the true story of Edward D.\n               Wood, Junior??\n\n     EXT. NIGHT SKY\n\n     Lightning CRACKS.\n\n     We drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential\n     rain... and end up...\n\n                                                    OPTICAL:\n\n     EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT\n\n     We've landed in Hollywood, 1952.  We're outside a teeny, grungy\n     playhouse.  The cracked marquee proclaims \"'THE CASUAL\n     COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR.\"\n\n     Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero.\n     Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style\n     handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed\n     optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons\n     within.\n\n     The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN \"BUNNY\" BRECKINRIDGE, 45,\n     hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a\n     string of pearls.\n\n                         [PAGE 2 MISSING]\n\n     Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.  In a\n     flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry-\n     for-a-career ingenue.  She's near tears.\n\n                             DOLORES\n               Eddie, my dove just flew out the\n               window!\n\n                             CREW MEMBER\n               She goes on in two minutes! What\n               are we gonna do??\n\n     They all look to Ed, awaiting a response.  He thinks a second,\n     then excitedly CLAPS his hands.\n\n                             ED\n               Dolores, give me your shoes.\n\n                             DOLORES\n               What?\n\n                             ED\n               The ghost can be barefoot.  Give\n               me your shoes!\n\n     She hands Ed her white shoes.  He snatches one, grabs a pair of\n     scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.  Everyone is baffled.\n     He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape\n     of a dove!\n\n     Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and\n     sprints into the dressing room.  He takes some green eye shadow\n     and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries\n     back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe...\n     and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!\n\n     The cast is flabbergasted.\n\n                             CREW MEMBER\n               Wow.\n\n     BACK ONSTAGE\n\n     The soldiers suddenly look up.\n\n                             ACTOR #1\n               Hey, I think I see something!\n\n     Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove.\n\n                             DOLORES\n               I offer you mortals the bird of\n               peace, so that you may change your\n               ways and end all this destruction.\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n\n     INT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n     Ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour\n     diner.

Everyone was terrific!\n               Paul, your second-act monologue\n               actually gave me chills,\n\n     He grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver\n     who's loyal like a dog.\n\n                             PAUL MARCO\n               Aw thanks, Eddie.\n\n     Actor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug,\n     runs up waving a newspaper.\n\n                             CONRAD\n               I got the early edition!

Ed turns to a column, \"The Theatrical\n     Life, By Victor Crowley.\"  Under this is a photograph of an old\n     man with an ascot.\n\n     WIDE\n\n     Everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading.   A\n     moment... and then their faces drop.  Clearly, this is a\n     disastrous review.  Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and\n     then they finish.  A melancholy beat, until --\n\n                             BUNNY\n               What does that old queen know?  He\n               wasn't even there!\n                       (he knocks back a drink)\n               Sending a copy boy to do his dirty\n               work.

He tries to smile.\n\n                             ED\n               Hey.  Hey, it's not that bad.  You\n               just can't concentrate on the\n               negative.  He's got some nice things\n               to say...\n                       (he scans the review)\n               See, \"The soldier costumes are very\n               realistic.\"  That's positive!\n\n     Everyone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed.

Like, that last\n               \"Francis the Mule\" picture -- it got\n               terrible notices.

BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n     ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's\n     evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the\n     famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture.\n\n     ON ED AND BELA\n\n     They are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's\n     TWO DOGS lie at his feet.\n\n     ON THE TV\n\n     The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV\n     screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy \"Creature Feature\" hostess,\n     a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress.\n\n     She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a\n     pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading \"Happy Halloween.\"\n\n                             VAMPIRA (on TV)\n               Ooo!  Those eyes!

Stare into my\n               eyes.\n\n     Ed joins Bela in this activity.  The two of them wave their\n     arms spookily at the TV.\n\n     Bela becomes fatigued.\n\n                             BELA\n               I am getting tired.

I'll be\n               alright.\n\n     Bela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps\n     behind a curtain.  Ed is puzzled.  Bela's thin arm appears and\n     draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers\n     opening and closing, and then silence.\n\n     Ed sits, waiting.\n\n     Behind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled \"Shit!\"\n\n     Ed is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and\n     Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy.\n\n                             BELA\n               I feel better now.\n\n     AT THE DOOR\n\n     The doorbell RINGS.  Kids SHOUT \"Trick or treat!\"  Bela jumps\n     up gleefully.\n\n                             BELA\n               Children!  I love children.\n\n     Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and\n     sticks them in his mouth.\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle\n     expectantly.\n\n     Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count\n     Dracula!  The real Count Dracula.  YEOWWWW!!!  The kids SCREAM\n     and run.\n\n     Bela chuckles.  Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY.\n\n                             BELA\n               Aren't you scared, little boy?

The wind\n     blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness.\n\n     Ed and Bela reach the locked gates.  They glance at each other,\n     then start to climb over.  Ed helps Bela.  They jump down, and\n     Ed peers nervously.\n\n                             ED\n               Now what?\n\n     Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning.

He starts chasing after Bela.\n\n     Bela's heart is racing.  He zig-zags past ancient crypts.\n     Gargoyles peer down.  The wind howls through the skeletal\n     trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky.\n\n     Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up.\n\n     Bela flaps his cape up and down.  We almost think he's going to\n     fly.\n\n     Ed races up, then quietly stops.  He eagerly watches Bela,\n     practically expecting him to turn into a bat.  It's a magical,\n     crazed moment.\n\n                             BELA\n               I am DRACUlA!

Bunny giggles and nudges gloomy Ed.\n\n                             BUNNY\n               So guess where I'm going next\n               weekend?\n\n                             ED\n               I don't know.

GOODBYE, PENIS!\n\n     The truckers nearby stare.  Dolores covers her face.\n\n                             DOLORES\n               Ssh!  Will you keep it down?\n\n     The crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up.  A favorite wrestler has\n     entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50.  Tor is an\n     incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth.\n\n                             RING ANNOUNCER (amplified)\n               Now entering the ring, in the gold\n               trunks, 350 bone-crunching pounds of\n               pure strength, the \"Swedish Angel\"...\n               Tor Johnson!!!\n\n     The crowd goes apeshit.  The stands are going to collapse from\n     the SHOUTING.\n\n     Ed's eyes are the size of saucers.\n\n                             ED\n               My God, look at that guy.  He's a\n               mountain!\n\n     The bell RINGS.  Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a\n     blue mask, and throws him at the ground.  Then Tor jumps onto\n     his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes.\n\n     People CHEER.  Ed is flabbergasted.\n\n                             ED\n               I've never seen anything like him!\n\n                             BUNNY\n               And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and\n               I are getting married --\n\n                             ED\n                       (eyes glued to the ring)\n               Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a monster!\n               Can you imagine what that guy would\n               be like in a movie?\n\n     ON TOR\n\n     He screams maniacally in Swedish.  Tor lifts the Opponent over\n     his head and tosses him into the stands.  Three rows of chairs\n     get knocked over.\n\n                                                    CUT TO:\n       \n     EXT. WRESTLER'S BAR - NIGHT\n\n     A tiny miniature European car pulls up.  Tor Johnson is\n     squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle.  Tor\n     carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar.\n\n     INT. WRESTLER'S BAR - SAME TIME\n\n     This rowdy bar is packed with burly WRESTLERS.  Tor walks in,\n     and men cheerily yell out: \"Hey, Tor!\" \"Hi, Tor!\"  Tor grins.\n     In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow.\n\n     Ed waves from the corner\n\n                             ED\n               Mr. Johnson, over here!\n\n     Tor smiles and lumbers over\n\n                             ED\n               Glad you could fit me in your\n               schedule.\n\n                             TOR\n                       (in a hoarse SWEDISH ACCENT)\n               Da pleasure be mine.\n\n     They shake hands.  Ed's hands look like a baby's in Tor's giant\n     mitts.\n\n     Tor tries to sit in the booth.  But he can't fit.\n\n                             TOR\n               Could we moovf to table?\n\n                             ED\n               Oh, of course!\n\n     Ed jumps up.  They move to a large table.  Now Tor is happy.\n     He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth.\n\n                             ED\n               So, Mr. Johnson --\n\n                             TOR\n               Tor!\n\n                             ED\n               Tor.

BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n     Ed steps into the dark room, and is stunned by what he sees:\n     Bela is slumped on the floor, pasty white, eyes glazed.  A\n     rubber tube is tied on his arm, and a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE lies\n     next to him.\n\n     The dogs crouch behind him, whimpering, despondent,\n     Bela looks up through half-opened eyes.\n\n                             BELA                                   \n               Eddie... my friend.\n\n     Aghast, Ed runs over.\n\n                             ED\n               Bela, what happened?!\n\n                             BELA\n               I didn't feel well...\n\n                             ED\n               Let me take you to the hospital.\n\n                             BELA\n               No hospital.  Just take me to the\n               couch...\n\n     Ed nods.  He picks up the old man and carries him across the\n     room to the couch.  The large portrait of Bela, young and\n     robust, peers down.\n\n                             ED\n               Should I call a doctor?\n\n                             BELA\n               Nah.

So forget it!\n\n     BACK AT THE PARTY\n\n     The backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of\n     Vampira, begging on his hands and knees.\n\n                             BACKER\n                       (to another backer)\n               I'm getting a bad feeling about this.\n               Let's get out of here.\n\n     The backers pick up their coats.

The thing must weigh half a ton.\n\n     Tor's eyes widen.\n\n     And the octopus smashes straight on top of him.\n\n     BAM!\n\n     Tor is gone from sight.  One of the eight tentacles snaps off.\n\n     UP IN THE CATWALK\n\n     Criswell moans.\n\n                             CRISWELL\n               Oh my God.

Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a\n     rubber tube.  Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then\n     ties the tube around his upper arm...\n\n     AT THE SET - LATER\n\n     Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny\n     fills it with a hose.
