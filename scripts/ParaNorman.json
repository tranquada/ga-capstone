A\r\n           massive billboard beside the main square reads \"BLITHE\r\n           HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!\" illustrated by a group\r\n           of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch\r\n           hanging from a gallows.

There's a dingy bar, the BAR\r\n           GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.\r\n           Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black\r\n           woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking\r\n           like he'd rather be elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<b>                          SHERIFF HOOPER\r\n</b>           Watch and learn. \"Parking\r\n           violation\" is my middle name.\r\n\r\n<b>                          DEPUTY DWAYNE\r\n</b>           Really?
