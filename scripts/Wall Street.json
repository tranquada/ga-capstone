Greed and\n\t\tspeculation have replaced long-term\n\t\tinvestment. Corporations are being\n\t\ttaken apart like erector sets,\n\t\twithout any consideration of the\n\t\tpublic good.

America has become a\n\t\tsecond rate power. Our trade\n\t\tdeficit and fiscal deficit are at\n\t\tnightmare proportions. In the days\n\t\tof the 'free market' when our\n\t\tcountry was a top industrial power,\n\t\tthere was accountability to the\n\t\tshareholders. The Carnegies, the\n\t\tMellons, the man who built this\n\t\tindustrial empire, made sure of it\n\t\tbecause it was their money at stake.\n\t\tToday management has no stake in\n\t\tthe company. Altogether these guys\n\t\tsitting up there own a total of\n\t\tless than 3% and where does Mr.\n\t\tCromwell put his million dollar\n\t\tsalary? Certainly not in Teldar\n\t\tstock, he owns less than 1%.\n\t\tYou own Teldar Paper, the\n\t\tstockholders, and you are being\n\t\troyally screwed over by these\n\t\tbureaucrats with their steak\n\t\tlunches, golf and hunting trips,\n\t\tcorporate jets, and golden\n\t\tparachutes! Teldar Paper has 33\n\t\tdifferent vice presidents each\n\t\tearning over $200,000 a year. I\n\t\tspent two months analyzing what\n\t\tthese guys did and I still can't\n\t\tfigure it out.\n\t\t\t(a big laugh)\n\n\n\tCromwell is pissed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCROMWELL\n</b>\t\tThis is an outrage Gekko! You're\n\t\tfull of shit!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tGEKKO\n</b>\t\tOne thing I do know is this paper\n\t\tcompany lost $110 million last\n\t\tyear, and I'd bet half of that is\n\t\tin the paperwork going back and\n\t\tforth between all the vice\n\t\tpresidents...\n\t\t\t(increased laughter,\n\t\t\the's getting them)\n\t\tThe new law of evolution in\n\t\tcorporate America seems to be\n\t\t'survival of the unfittest'. Well\n\t\tin my book, you either do it right\n\t\tor you get eliminated. Teldar Paper\n\t\tis doomed to fail. Its\n\t\tdiversification into casualty\n\t\tinsurance has not worked. Its crown\n\t\tjewels are its trees, the rest is\n\t\tdross. Through wars, depressions,\n\t\tinflations and deterioration of\n\t\tpaper money, trees have always kept\n\t\ttheir value, but Teldar is chopping\n\t\tthem all down. Forests are\n\t\tperishable, forest rights are as\n\t\timportant as human rights to this\n\t\tplanet, and all the illusory\n\t\tMaginot lines, scorched earth\n\t\ttactics, proxy fights, poison\n\t\tpills, etc. that Mr.\n\t\tCromwell is going to come up with\n\t\tto prevent people like me from\n\t\tbuying Teldar Paper are doomed to\n\t\tfail because the bottom line,\n\t\tladies and gentlemen, as you very\n\t\twell know, is the only way to stay\n\t\tstrong is to create value, that's\n\t\twhy you buy stock, to have it go up.\n\t\tIf there's any other reason, I've\n\t\tnever hear it.\n\t\t\t(laughter)\n\t\tThat's all I'm saying...it's you\n\t\tpeople who own this company, not\n\t\tthem, they work for you and they've\n\t\tdone a lousy job of it. Get rid of\n\t\tthem fast, before you all get sick\n\t\tand die. I may be an opportunist,\n\t\tbut if these clowns did a better\n\t\tjob, I'd be out of work. In the\n\t\tlast seven deals I've been in,\n\t\tthere were 2.3 million stockholders\n\t\tthat actually made a pretax profit\n\t\tof $12 billion. When I bought the\n\t\tIxtlan Corporation it was in the\n\t\texact same position Teldar is\n\t\ttoday -- I turned three of its\n\t\tcompanies private and I sold four\n\t\tothers -- and each of these\n\t\tcompanies, liberated from the\n\t\tsuffering conglomerate has\n\t\tprospered. I am not a destroyer of\n\t\tcompanies, I am a liberator of them.\n\t\tThe point is, ladies and gentlemen,\n\t\tgreed is good. Greed works, greed\n\t\tis right. Greed clarifies, cuts\n\t\tthrough, and captures the essence\n\t\tof the evolutionary spirit. Greed\n\t\tin all its forms, greed for life,\n\t\tmoney, love, knowledge, has marked\n\t\tthe upward surge of mankind -- and\n\t\tgreed, mark my words -- will save\n\t\tnot only Teldar Paper but that\n\t\tother malfunctioning corporation\n\t\tcalled the USA...Thank you.\n\n\tMuch applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of\n\tapproval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to\n\tcontinue the meeting by calling for \"order\".\n\n\tBud watches, impressed.\n\n<b>\tINT.

The\n\tcity views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of\n\tother cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are\n\tworking on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the\n\tliving room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a\n\tTALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks\n\tlike a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old\n\tcolumns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the\n\tentrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink\n\tinto an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.\n\n<b>\tINT.

A fantail shrimp chaise from\n\tArt Furniture's \"Sushi Collection\" arrives, along with an\n\tenormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made\n\tdeliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on\n\teach end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a\n\tpoured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from\n\tPompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for\n\tthe bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien\n\tsitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled\n\tbranches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.\n\n\tTHIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer\n\tdishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and\n\tsinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives\n\tus a sense of the modernist approach to food and its\n\tpreparation:\n\n\t1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as\n\n\t2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work\n\ton two dozen oysters...\n\n\t3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette\n\tmixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's \"Jupiter\"...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tBUD\n</b>\t\t\t(picking it up)\n\t\tYes...no...at 37 1/2.

Darien instructs the movers to place\n\tan important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered\n\tin buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for\n\t$20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is\n\tleft of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have\n\tbeen removed, mouldings and architectural found objects\n\tadded, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been\n\tcreated from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil\n\tcrew. The point is, decorating can transform.\n\n<b>\tINT. CONDO - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tThe look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet\n\tsumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the\n\tsofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled\n\tvelvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite\n\tmadonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis\n\tgraces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of\n\thighrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.\n\tThis apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the\n\t\"correct\" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.\n\tPerhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the\n\tcomputerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he\n\tneeds a set of instructions just to be able to switch on\n\tDavid Letterman.\n\n\tThis apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the\n\tincidental client who paid for it.

Fueled by\n\t\ttakeover rumors, the stock soared\n\t\tto an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then\n\t\twhen contradictory rumors later\n\t\tsurfaced that the takeover was\n\t\tunfounded, buyers went running for\n\t\tcover, and the stock plummeted on\n\t\tgigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2\n\t\tbefore closing at 17.\n\n\tCamera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.\n\tRudy seen riding his toy car in background.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tNEWSCASTER\n</b>\t\t...but then tonight, amidst all the\n\t\tscuttlebutt, another rumble shook\n\t\t\t(a beat)\n\t\tAccording to many sources, raider\n\t\tSir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in\n\t\tand bought a substantial block of\n\t\tBluestar and is going to announce a\n\t\tdeal tomorrow at 18 that includes\n\t\tthe support of the unions.\n\n\tCamera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the\n\tunexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko\n\tleans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing\n\tinto burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with\n\ta massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.\n\n<b>\tEXT. WALL STREET - MORNING\n</b>\n\tPeople rushing to work.

BUD'S OFFICE - DAY\n</b>\n\tAs Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC\n\tINVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his\n\tfiles. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk\n\tusing the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN\n\tstand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a\n\twithering glance.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tPATTERSON\n</b>\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tHe just came in.

Bud gets to his knees,\n\tblood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby\n\tlook on, wondering.\n\n\tGekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He\n\thands Bud a handkerchief.
