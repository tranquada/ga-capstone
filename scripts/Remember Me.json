SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1\r\n\r\n    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City\r\n\r\n    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her\r\n    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.\r\n\r\n    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.\r\n    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is\r\n    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday\r\n    party they attended in The City.\r\n\r\n    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink\r\n    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on\r\n    her right wrist.\r\n\r\n    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station\r\n    platform.\r\n\r\n    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,\r\n    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.\r\n\r\n    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them\r\n    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.\r\n\r\n    The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys\r\n    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's\r\n    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F\r\n    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.\r\n\r\n    Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.\r\n\r\n    And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the\r\n    stairwell behind them.\r\n\r\n    Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and\r\n    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his\r\n    gun.\r\n\r\n    Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks\r\n    terrified.\r\n\r\n    The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over\r\n    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and\r\n    her wedding band.\r\n\r\n    One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.\r\n\r\n    The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to\r\n    the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.\r\n\r\n    We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.\r\n\r\n    Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.\r\n                                                                2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    -- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.\r\n\r\n    The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail\r\n    car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.\r\n\r\n    Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy\r\n    holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK\r\n    OF CONTEMPT.\r\n\r\n    The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?\r\n\r\n    -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --\r\n\r\n    When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the\r\n    car doors from closing.\r\n\r\n    A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...\r\n    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke\r\n    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.\r\n\r\n    Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2\r\n\r\n    A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white\r\n    sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.\r\n\r\n    BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a\r\n    man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,\r\n    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches\r\n    the platform, he stops.\r\n\r\n    Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay\r\n    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees\r\n    it. Then he turns...\r\n\r\n    THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.\r\n    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it\r\n    into his pocket.\r\n\r\n    Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police\r\n    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.\r\n    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her\r\n    legs not quite working.\r\n\r\n    Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting\r\n    her as the blanket falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n    Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but\r\n    can't.\r\n\r\n    Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches\r\n    the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.\r\n                                                                3.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.\r\n    Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,\r\n    he's back up.\r\n\r\n    Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all\r\n    the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.\r\n\r\n    WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a\r\n    clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN\r\n    TOWERS STAND TALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3\r\n\r\n    SUBTITLE: \"Eight Years Later\"\r\n\r\n    Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on\r\n    the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the\r\n    bed.\r\n\r\n    TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is\r\n    sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a\r\n    blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well\r\n    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand\r\n    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration\r\n    etched in his face.\r\n\r\n    A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.\r\n\r\n    Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of\r\n    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost\r\n    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the\r\n    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple\r\n    of hours.\r\n\r\n    The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...\r\n\r\n                        BLONDE\r\n                  (out of it)\r\n              Hello?\r\n\r\n    Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the\r\n    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes\r\n    widen in alarm.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              Yeah...\r\n                  (listens)\r\n              Of course. I'm on my way. I\r\n              know...I know...I know...I know.\r\n\r\n    Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark\r\n    suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we\r\n    observe a TATTOO that simply says \"Michael\" over his heart.\r\n                                                                 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n    He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a\r\n    reasonably clean button down shirt...\r\n\r\n                        TYLER V/O\r\n              Gandhi said that whatever you do in\r\n              life will be insignificant but it\r\n              is very important that you do it...\r\n\r\n    ...And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an\r\n    expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher\r\n    brush.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER V/O\r\n              ...I tend to agree with the first\r\n              part.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER                     4\r\n\r\n    A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the\r\n    distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a\r\n    funeral. It's a memorial.\r\n\r\n    A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a\r\n    stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE\r\n    SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.\r\n\r\n    Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty\r\n    coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles\r\n    and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.\r\n    Time is money.\r\n\r\n    Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket\r\n    pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then\r\n    extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins\r\n    towards the mourners.\r\n\r\n    His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in\r\n    the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive\r\n    bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but\r\n    doesn't want anyone to know she has.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n                  (sweetly)\r\n              Hello, your majesty. How are you?\r\n\r\n                        DIANE\r\n              I'm fine... you look good...\r\n\r\n    He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his\r\n    stepfather...\r\n\r\n    LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and\r\n    tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.\r\n                                                              5.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his\r\n    diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's\r\n    holding a little paper bag.\r\n\r\n    She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              Thanks for organizing everybody.\r\n\r\n    Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.\r\n\r\n                        CAROLINE\r\n              You smell like Listerine and beer.\r\n\r\n    He snorts and kisses her cheek.\r\n\r\n    Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of\r\n    smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names:\r\n    \"Mom\" \"Tyler\" \"Les\", \"Dad\", \"Caroline\". She begins to arrange\r\n    them in a little circle on the grave.\r\n\r\n    Tyler's father...\r\n\r\n    CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely\r\n    dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.\r\n\r\n                        CHARLES\r\n                  (aside, to Tyler)\r\n              You couldn't wear a tie?\r\n\r\n    Tyler holds his father's eye.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              Could have.\r\n\r\n    Beat.\r\n\r\n    Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.\r\n\r\n    POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side-\r\n    by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline\r\n    sits on the ground, arranging the stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER                  5\r\n\r\n    The family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic\r\n    lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of\r\n    Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once.\r\n    Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is\r\n    eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware.\r\n                                                             6.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n          ...This is nice... I think it's\r\n          nice that we still do this...\r\n\r\n                       CAROLINE\r\n                 (gently)\r\n          Mom.\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n          I forgot. I'm trying to purge\r\n          \"nice\" from my vocabulary. Michael\r\n          would like that we still do this.\r\n\r\nTyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word\r\nhis mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n              (to Caroline)\r\n          Did you tell Tyler what your art\r\n          teacher said about your portrait?\r\n\r\nCaroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at\r\nher mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n                    CAROLINE\r\n          Tyler, did I tell you what my art\r\n          teacher said about my portrait?\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          Why no, Caroline. What did your art\r\n          teacher say about your portrait?\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n              (smiling)\r\n          You two. I quit.\r\n\r\nShe flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les'\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n                    CAROLINE\r\n          ...She was very impressed. She said\r\n          I captured a moment like a young\r\n          James Whistler.\r\n\r\nThe WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to\r\nthe table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a\r\nglass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek\r\nPhillippe.\r\n                                                             7.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          Young Whistler... good... 'cause\r\n          Whistler really fell off late in\r\n          his career. He's the Michael\r\n          Jackson of European art history.\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n          She suggested your sister take\r\n          Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and\r\n          that's hugely prestigious.\r\n\r\nCaroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline.\r\n\r\nDiane, again, flickers a glance at Charles.\r\n\r\n                    CAROLINE\r\n          I would be the youngest one, ever,\r\n          practically...\r\n\r\n                    CHARLES\r\n          Tyler, would you please pass the\r\n          butter?\r\n\r\nBeat.\r\n\r\n                    DIANE\r\n          Caroline was speaking.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n              (to Charles)\r\n          Are you really this clueless? Are\r\n          you really dismissing her like\r\n          this?\r\n\r\nDiane touches Caroline's hair.\r\n\r\n                    CHARLES\r\n          Caroline is perfectly capable of\r\n          speaking up if she is feeling\r\n          dismissed. Caroline, are you\r\n          feeling dismissed?\r\n\r\n                      CAROLINE\r\n          I'm okay.\r\n\r\n                    CHARLES\r\n              (solicitous, to Caroline)\r\n          I didn't mean to change the\r\n          subject.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          What was the subject?\r\n                                                              8.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHARLES\r\n              Excuse me?\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              The subject we were discussing.\r\n              What was it?\r\n\r\n    Beat.\r\n\r\n                        CHARLES\r\n              Now's not the time for your heroics\r\n              Tyler\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              No. It's the perfect time.\r\n\r\n    Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar.\r\n\r\n    Father and son lock eyes until...\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n                  (whispering, to Caroline)\r\n              Do you need me to take you\r\n              anywhere?\r\n\r\n    Caroline shakes her head.\r\n\r\n                        CAROLINE\r\n              I'll stay with mom.\r\n\r\n    Diane glares at her ex-husband.\r\n\r\n    Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              Then I'll see you after school.\r\n\r\n                           CAROLINE\r\n              Kay.\r\n\r\n    He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's\r\n    eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER                                 6\r\n\r\n    Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The\r\n    car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and\r\n    button down and ties them both around his waist.\r\n                                                                  9.\r\n\r\n\r\n7   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER                             7\r\n\r\n    Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out\r\n    of place amidst all the business types.\r\n\r\n    He sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered\r\n    JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his\r\n    page as he works quietly crafting an entry.\r\n\r\n    The HOSTESS, tired, in her 60's, slides a piece of baklava on\r\n    the table as she shuffles past.\r\n\r\n                        HOSTESS\r\n              Eat something.\r\n\r\n    Tyler gives her a huge grin.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              Yes, ma'am.\r\n\r\n\r\n8   EXT. 4TH STREET -- JUST AFTER                                     8\r\n\r\n    Tyler and his roommate, AIDAN BREWER, 22, energetic,\r\n    inappropriate, walking west towards N.Y.U. Young people in\r\n    easy, summery dress. Tyler smokes. Aidan doesn't. Aidan\r\n    remembers something, smirks.\r\n\r\n                        AIDAN\r\n              I sold your girlfriend a\r\n              toothbrush.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              You sold my who? ...What?\r\n\r\n                        AIDAN\r\n              That voluptuous, delightfully\r\n              oblivious little blonde you left in\r\n              your bed this morning... I sold her\r\n              a toothbrush. Got three bucks.\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              ...Congratulations?\r\n\r\n                        AIDAN\r\n              Are in order, yes. Because that\r\n              sale inspired our newest business\r\n              venture: \"The S.L.U.T.\"\r\n\r\n                        TYLER\r\n              I was unaware we had a previous\r\n              business venture.\r\n                                       10.\r\n\r\n\r\n          AIDAN\r\nThe 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'.\r\nIt's the one-night-stand travel\r\npack for women. We throw in some\r\nmake-up, toiletries, cell phone\r\ncharger, cab numbers. Retail it at\r\nS19.95, maybe do an infomercial.\r\n\r\n          TYLER\r\nAnd you think women would buy this?\r\nWith money?\r\n\r\n          AIDAN\r\nHey one-night-stands happen... It's\r\na part of life... like stubbing\r\nyour toe. Sometimes you misjudge a\r\ncorner and bend back your pinky\r\ntoe, other times you wake up in a\r\nfreshman dorm wearing a field\r\nhockey tee shirt wondering why your\r\nballs smell like cinnamon...\r\n\r\n          TYLER\r\n    (nodding sagely)\r\nOf course. Yes.\r\n\r\n          AIDAN\r\nDon't underestimate the novelty\r\ngift market. Think about it...\r\ninstead of giving that token slutty\r\nfriend a ten-inch purple dildo for\r\nher birthday, you hook her up with\r\n\"The SLUT.\" Everyone has a laugh\r\nand the implication that she'll\r\nprobably use it someday remains.\r\nWhat do you say? Are you down?\r\n\r\n          TYLER\r\nI'm down with getting you on some\r\nsort of medication.\r\n\r\n          AIDAN\r\nOK...fine...be cynical...just\r\nremember at some point in history\r\ntwo people had a conversation just\r\nlike this about the light bulb. One\r\nof them went on to fame and fortune\r\nand the other one probably went to\r\nwork at Mickey D's or something.\r\n\r\n          TYLER\r\nOr Denny's. Denny's was big in the\r\n19th century.\r\n                                                              11.\r\n\r\n\r\n9    EXT.

They couldn't\r\n     see her even if they wanted to.\r\n\r\n                         PROFESSOR (O.S.)\r\n               It's an unfortunate reality but a\r\n               reality nonetheless ...\r\n\r\n\r\n11   INT.

She\r\n     raises her hand.\r\n\r\n                         GIRL\r\n               Isn't that also an ethical\r\n               question?\r\n\r\n     Tyler shoots her a glance. He takes in her lovely face, her\r\n     casual dress, and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf\r\n     clovers. WE REALIZE this is Alicia \"Ally\" Craig, now 19.\r\n\r\n     Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n12   EXT.

Even the\r\n          bathroom.\r\n\r\nTyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground.\r\n\r\n                    CAROLINE\r\n          Why do you think Dad doesn't\r\n          wanna...like, listen to me?\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          Dad loves you.\r\n\r\nCaroline gives him a look.\r\n\r\n                    CAROLINE\r\n          So? You can love someone and not\r\n          want to spend any time with them.\r\n\r\nCaroline is climbing around Alice.

But Michael was 21.\r\n               All 21 year olds drink because it's\r\n               new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks\r\n               because she wishes she was 21.\r\n\r\n     A shared smile.\r\n\r\n                            CAROLINE\r\n               You're 21.\r\n\r\n     Tyler's smile fades.\r\n\r\n\r\n13   INT.

His hand goes to his pocket and\r\nfishes out his pack of cigarettes.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN'S GIRL\r\n              (to Aidan)\r\n          Asshole.\r\n\r\nShe walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN'S GIRL\r\n          Are you coming?\r\n\r\nTyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER'S GIRL\r\n              (to her friend)\r\n          Hold on, Lauren.\r\n\r\nThe girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to\r\nconvince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.\r\n\r\nTyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking\r\nMUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND\r\nEQUIPMENT.\r\n\r\nA quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of\r\nthem in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at\r\nthe wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch\r\nthe car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.\r\n                                                         18.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just\r\nwants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and\r\nlurches again.\r\n\r\nMUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.\r\n\r\n                    MUSICIAN#2\r\n          What's your problem?\r\n\r\n                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER\r\n          My problem? Keep your hands off my\r\n          car, asshole.\r\n\r\n                    MUSICIAN#2\r\n          Blow it out your ass, Guido.\r\n\r\n                    MUSICIAN#1\r\n          Go back to Long Island.\r\n\r\nThe car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the\r\nfront of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat\r\nat his side.\r\n\r\n                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER\r\n          I'm from Queens, faggot\r\n\r\nA Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver\r\nstarts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as\r\nthe Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned\r\ninto a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped\r\ninto the pavement.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER'S GIRL\r\n          So we were thinking we could go...\r\n\r\nTyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN\r\n              (under his breath)\r\n          God damn it.\r\n\r\nAidan runs off after Tyler.\r\n\r\nTyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing\r\nthe beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the\r\nguy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not\r\nstopping.\r\n\r\nAidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the\r\nguy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits\r\nTyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the\r\nchin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.\r\nIt's a brawl.\r\n                                                                19.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,\r\n     following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near\r\n     enough to the brawl to imperil herself.\r\n\r\n     A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.\r\n     She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,\r\n     splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.\r\n\r\n\r\n16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16\r\n\r\n     An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.\r\n\r\n     THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.\r\n\r\n     SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we\r\n     first met him at the train station, is standing with the\r\n     Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.\r\n\r\n     Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to\r\n     her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the\r\n     Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.\r\n\r\n     Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger,\r\n     is on the radio to Dispatch.\r\n\r\n     Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a\r\n     blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to\r\n     his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               Cut those two loose.\r\n\r\n     Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.\r\n\r\n                         LEO\r\n                   (quiet)\r\n               Take a walk.\r\n\r\n     Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his\r\n     wrists, gestures \"Let's go\". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl\r\n     and...\r\n\r\n     Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               Anything in here that's going to\r\n               stab me, Einstein?\r\n\r\n     Craig finds a packet, or a vial.\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               Nice. You like to get high and hit\r\n               women?\r\n                                                            20.\r\n\r\n\r\nAidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in\r\nthe action.\r\n\r\n                    NEANDERTHAL#1\r\n          I don't even know the bitch.\r\n\r\nRage flickers across Craig's face.\r\n\r\nCraig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going\r\nthrough their pockets.\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          How about you two?\r\n\r\nTyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.\r\n\r\n                    MUSICIAN#1\r\n          It wasn't us, man!\r\n\r\n                    NEANDERTHAL#1\r\n          That cocksucker kicked my car!\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          Shut up, genius.\r\n\r\n                    MUSICIAN#1\r\n              (to Neanderthal)\r\n          Eat shit, pencil dick.\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          Alright. That's it. Everybody goes\r\n          downtown.\r\n\r\nTyler steps forward, interrupting...\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          It wasn't them.\r\n\r\nAidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN\r\n              (sotto)\r\n          Tyler...\r\n\r\n                    LEO\r\n              (quietly, to the guys)\r\n          Take a walk, I said.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          Hey!\r\n\r\nCraig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.\r\n                                                         21.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          They didn't do anything. They\r\n          didn't start this. Those assholes\r\n          did. Why do these guys have to go\r\n          downtown?\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          What are you still doing here?\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          This is bullshit. It was those\r\n          gorillas who started this.\r\n\r\nCraig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through\r\nTyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you\r\n          think I give a shit?\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          You're a police officer. You're\r\n          supposed to.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to\r\nTyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns\r\na bit to Tyler.\r\n\r\n                    CRAIG\r\n          It's a great relief to me, Mr.\r\n          Roth, to know that you're on top of\r\n          the situation. Now go the fuck\r\n          home.\r\n\r\nHe turns back to work.\r\n\r\nTyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate \"Please!\r\nLet's get out of here!\"\r\n\r\nTyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.\r\n\r\nAidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig\r\nlooks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be\r\nout of his mind.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          How about you do your job?\r\n\r\nSLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the\r\npavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies\r\nthere dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on\r\nTyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the\r\ncuffs on.\r\n                                                                22.\r\n\r\n\r\n17   INT. PEARL STREET LOCKUP -- AFTER                           17\r\n\r\n     Who knows what time it is. A lovely ASSORTMENT OF\r\n     PERPETRATORS, Tyler and the musicians are in lockup.\r\n     Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the\r\n     holding cell, looking quite relaxed.\r\n\r\n     The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the\r\n     perch. The ESCORTING OFFICER shouts across the din to Tyler.\r\n\r\n                         ESCORTING OFFICER\r\n               You can have your call now.\r\n\r\n                           TYLER\r\n               I'm good.\r\n\r\n     The door slides shut behind Aidan.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               You're good?

Okay.\r\n\r\n     Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket\r\n     and starts washing his hands at the sink.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               I'll call you back.

He smiles a charming smile at the\r\n     aggravated woman.\r\n\r\n                          TYLER\r\n               Tease.\r\n\r\n                          JANINE O/S\r\n               Tyler...\r\n                                                                 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind\r\n     eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               He's ready for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n21   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- HALLWAY -- AFTER                     21\r\n\r\n     Tyler follows Janine down the corridor. She looks him up and\r\n     down, doesn't like what she sees.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               You're too skinny. And you smell\r\n               like french fries and cigarettes.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Nice to see you too.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               You want me to lie?\r\n\r\n     Tyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie. Janine scrolls\r\n     through a Palm Pilot as she walks. They approach the double\r\n     doors to Charles' office.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               Try not to give him a heart attack.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Okay.\r\n\r\n     Tyler bangs through the doors. Janine grimaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n22   INT. CAVERNOUS EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- LATER                     22\r\n\r\n     A row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds.\r\n     Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass\r\n     and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen\r\n     computer, but no personal effects anywhere.\r\n\r\n     Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles\r\n     registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles'\r\n     face. Tyler stands.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               I came to see how much it costs,\r\n               because I'm giving you the money\r\n               back.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLES\r\n               How much what costs?\r\n                                                              27.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               That lawyer.\r\n\r\n     Beat.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLES\r\n               Ah.

He looks up and sees Janine looking at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n24   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER.                    24\r\n\r\n     Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of\r\n     businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot\r\n     tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him,\r\n     loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the\r\n     manic rhythm of his foot.\r\n                                                              28.\r\n\r\n\r\n25   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. JUST AFTER.                            25\r\n\r\n     It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a\r\n     CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards\r\n     Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says\r\n     makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls\r\n     snicker.\r\n\r\n     Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on\r\n     a fire hydrant.\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n                      (to Caroline)\r\n               Hey.\r\n\r\n     He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his\r\n     cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a\r\n     group swoon.\r\n\r\n     He takes Caroline by the elbow...\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Excuse us, we're due in surgery.\r\n\r\n     He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth\r\n     Avenue.\r\n\r\n                         CAROLINE\r\n               What happened to your face?\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Horrible threshing accident.\r\n\r\n                         CAROLINE\r\n               You're so retarded.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Don't mock the afflicted. Here,\r\n               I brought you something.\r\n\r\n     He hands her the book of Myths.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               This was my favorite book ever.\r\n               Michael had it and he hit me over\r\n               the head with it until I read it.\r\n               Its about all these God and\r\n               Goddesses who spend all of their\r\n               time being jealous and petty and\r\n               otherwise acting like human beings.\r\n               The illustrations are amazing.\r\n\r\n     Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles.\r\n                                                              29.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CAROLINE\r\n               Ooh. These are cool. Thanks!

Other times too. Madamoiselle\r\n               Fleischman had to snap her fingers\r\n               at me a lot today. And everybody\r\n               laughed and they all think I'm a\r\n               freak of nature.\r\n\r\n     Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the\r\n     school.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Je m'appelle \"Freak of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n     Caroline smirks.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je\r\n               m'appelle \"Freak of Nature\". Sacre\r\n               Bleu.

NYU -- FRONT STEPS BELOW THE FLAGS -- DAY            26\r\n\r\n     Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or\r\n     out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she\r\n     just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual.\r\n                                                              30.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               ...I know by every numerical\r\n               measurement I didn't pass but what\r\n               I was hoping was that maybe you\r\n               give me a grade on my trying to\r\n               pass.

Ally\r\n     gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the\r\n     stairs, right past Aidan.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n                   (distracted)\r\n               I mean... uh... life's only about\r\n               what we put into it.

And what they put into it.\r\n               And I'm -- ah, screw it.\r\n\r\n     Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n27   INT.

The\r\n     hypnotic first track fills the room.\r\n\r\n     Ally comes across a FRAMED PHOTO of a band on stage. The lead\r\n     guitarist looks like Tyler with long hair.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Is that you?\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               That's Michael.

She grunts,\r\n     unglamorously.\r\n\r\n\r\n42   INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER                               42\r\n\r\n     Tyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his\r\n     shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the\r\n     opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on\r\n     the shower. She has his drivers licence.\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n               Apologize.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Never. Your middle name is Keats?\r\n               Your parents are pretentious as\r\n               hell.\r\n\r\n     Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She\r\n     dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower\r\n     head and turns it at him.\r\n\r\n     Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for\r\n     the shower head.\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n               Apologize.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               I'd rather eat monkeys.\r\n\r\n     This cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and\r\n     gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in\r\n     surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head,\r\n     giggling.\r\n\r\n     They lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged.\r\n\r\n     Ally spritzes him in the face.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               I surrender! Oh my God, you're\r\n               relentless.\r\n                                                                 48.\r\n\r\n\r\n     He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally\r\n     follows.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Victory at all costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n43   INT. BATH TUB -- LATER                                       43\r\n\r\n     Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang\r\n     over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and\r\n     removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Now... I'm furious.\r\n\r\n     He tosses them in a waste basket.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               You should quit anyway.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Really? Why? Are cigarettes like\r\n               bad for you or something?\r\n\r\n     Ally playfully slaps him. She notices the tip of Tyler's\r\n     TATTOO peeking out of his undershirt.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Is that a tattoo? Let me see.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               It's not really...\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Please. It's very bad ass. All that\r\n               ritualistic scarring.\r\n\r\n     Tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as Ally offers\r\n     polite applause. Michael's name becomes clear. Ally takes a\r\n     long look. She sees Tyler's not smiling anymore. She gets it.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't\r\n               realize.\r\n\r\n     She looks at him. Asking with out asking.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               He killed himself.\r\n\r\n     Beat.\r\n                                                            49.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ALLY\r\n          When?\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          When he was 21. He had just started\r\n          working for my father.\r\n\r\nAlly is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off Tyler.\r\n\r\n                    ALLY\r\n          I thought he was a musician.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          He was. But he wasn't making a\r\n          living doing music and my father's\r\n          a very compelling guy.\r\n\r\n                      ALLY\r\n          Mine too.\r\n\r\nAlly looks away for a moment. Tucks a curl behind her ear.\r\n\r\nThen they look at each other. Ally opens her mouth to speak.\r\n\r\nAidan bursts in. He's drunk, loud, wearing an Irish Flag like\r\na cape. He carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of Guinness.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN\r\n          Damn, you're not naked.\r\n\r\n                    TYLER\r\n          You're not Irish.\r\n\r\n                    AIDAN\r\n          T, What happened in the kitchen?

Aidan\r\n     appears in the doorway still wearing that flag.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               Hey, how we doin'?\r\n\r\n     Ally tries to speak, all we hear is a series of groans. Then\r\n     she dry heaves again. Tyler shoots Aidan a look.\r\n\r\n                          AIDAN\r\n               What? What do you want me to say?\r\n               That I'm sorry?

He finds\r\n     a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it.\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               ...She was supposed to be back.\r\n               She's not back ... call Ted\r\n               Proferes ... and what's his face in\r\n               the 9th...and call me back.

Ally\r\n     enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't\r\n     look at her as she pours herself a coffee.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               ...I'm sorry.

Not looking at her.\r\n\r\n     Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to\r\n     the phone.\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               You turned your phone off.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               I forgot to charge it.\r\n\r\n     It dawns on her...\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               That's mine.

He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of\r\n     his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on\r\n     the cabinets.\r\n\r\n                         CRAIG\r\n               Ally!\r\n\r\n     His face is contorted with panic and shame.\r\n\r\n     Ally's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A\r\n     knot is starting to form where she hit her head.\r\n\r\n     She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has\r\n     no idea who he is.\r\n\r\n     Beat.\r\n\r\n     Craig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes\r\n     him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She\r\n     scrambles up the stairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n49   EXT. RAILROAD FLAT-- ROOFTOP -- DAY                         49\r\n\r\n     Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway,\r\n     a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works\r\n     out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach\r\n     chair, trying again with the guitar.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               ...So? She just left? No good bye?\r\n\r\n     Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan\r\n     finishes up a set.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               Maybe she heard you play the\r\n               guitar.\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               You were the one dumping Jello\r\n               shots down her throat. You almost\r\n               killed her.\r\n\r\n     Aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of\r\n     weight on the bar.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               There are sins of omission and sins\r\n               of commission, my friend.

It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler\r\n     forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               ...little help, T... little help,\r\n               little help, lotta help... TYLER?!\r\n\r\n     Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down\r\n     the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing\r\n     his chest.\r\n\r\n                         AIDAN\r\n               What the hell was that?\r\n\r\n                         TYLER\r\n               Penance.

TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                             53\r\n\r\n     We interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler\r\n     sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his\r\n     neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes\r\n     control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop\r\n     him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making.\r\n                                                                 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n     In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping,\r\n     a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise\r\n     and recognition.\r\n\r\n     Then again. Young, hungry, aggressive.\r\n\r\n     TIME LAPSE\r\n\r\n     They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each\r\n     other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in\r\n     her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place.\r\n     Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in\r\n     this dream state, to make love all over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n54   INT. BEDROOM -- BEFORE SUNRISE                               54\r\n\r\n     The sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies\r\n     asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her,\r\n     he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to\r\n     brighten.\r\n\r\n     Tyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal.\r\n\r\n     A NOTE propped up next to the bed: \"Please don't leave. I'll\r\n     be back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n55   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                       55\r\n\r\n     Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop.\r\n\r\n\r\n56   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- SUNRISE                      56\r\n\r\n     The place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go.\r\n     He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the\r\n     binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him.\r\n\r\n     Janine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles.\r\n     She picks up her coffees and approaches him.\r\n\r\n                            JANINE\r\n                  I can't believe you still come down\r\n                  here.\r\n\r\n     Tyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees.\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n                  It's not so far. I can't believe\r\n                  you still get his coffee... three\r\n                  sugars, no milk?\r\n                                                              58.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n                   (shrugs)\r\n               Old habits. You're not writing\r\n               anything bad about me, are you?\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n               Not today.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               I gotta run. Early meetings.\r\n\r\n     Janine turns to go, remembers something, turns back.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               I probably won't see you before\r\n               Saturday so...happy birthday.\r\n\r\n     Tyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes.\r\n\r\n                         JANINE\r\n               I'll be sure to tell your father\r\n               that you said hello.\r\n\r\n     Tyler nods sheepishly.\r\n\r\n\r\n57   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER                   57\r\n\r\n     Tyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic\r\n     croak...\r\n\r\n                            AIDAN O/S\r\n               Bialy.\r\n\r\n     Tyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal.\r\n\r\n     Ally lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea\r\n     in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little.\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n               Hey...\r\n\r\n                            ALLY\r\n               Hey...\r\n\r\n     Tyler sits. She shifts and curls next to him.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Where did you go?\r\n\r\n                            TYLER\r\n               Downtown.\r\n                                                         59.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           Why?\r\n\r\nTyler pulls his JOURNAL from his pocket. Hands it to her.\r\n\r\n                     TYLER\r\n           There's a coffee shop. I brought\r\n           you a Bialy.\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           New York is full of coffee shops.\r\n\r\n                     TYLER\r\n           This one was our place... Michael's\r\n           and mine. We had breakfast there\r\n           all the time ... Maybe not as many\r\n           times as I think we did. But enough\r\n           times. Anyway we ate there that\r\n           morning. It was the last place I\r\n           saw him.\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           Oh. So you go there to write? To\r\n           him?\r\n\r\n                     TYLER\r\n           Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But\r\n           I guess I wanted to tell him about\r\n           you.\r\n\r\nAlly is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses\r\nnot to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it\r\nback to him. Then out of nowhere.\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           My mom was murdered eight years\r\n           ago. The same year your brother\r\n           died.\r\n\r\nTyler is stunned.\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           You don't need to say anything, I\r\n           know you're sorry. Everyone's\r\n           always sorry, you know?\r\n\r\nHe does.\r\n\r\n                     ALLY\r\n           It's just, I need you to know that,\r\n           my dad, he's not an evil guy.\r\n                     (MORE)\r\n                                                                 60.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY (cont'd)\r\n               I don't want you to think that\r\n               because I'm here he's some kind of\r\n               belligerent psychotic, he's not...I\r\n               don't know, it's just recently, he\r\n               seems really...\r\n\r\n     She looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient.\r\n\r\n     Ally tears up.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               Wounded? Our house is like the\r\n               recovery room, or the critical care\r\n               unit or something.\r\n\r\n     Tyler strokes her hair.\r\n\r\n                         ALLY\r\n               I don't feel like that, though. I\r\n               feel like I'm getting stronger and\r\n               like I'm leaving him behind to swim\r\n               in it all by himself.\r\n\r\n     She is weeping. Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can.\r\n     Holding her and kissing her hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n58   INT.

She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn\r\n     (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from\r\n     the ALICE statue in frosting.\r\n\r\n     It reads \"A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU\", and has \"22\" in\r\n     numerical candles and \"+ 1 TO UNGROW ON\" written next to\r\n     that.\r\n                                                                68.\r\n\r\n\r\n     She's singing.

There's got to be six inches\r\n     of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden\r\n     spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most\r\n     blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the\r\n     light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her\r\n     eyes widen...\r\n                                                                  80.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ALLY\r\n               Oh my God.\r\n\r\n     She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let\r\n     her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and\r\n     understand. He kisses her, so she won't see.
