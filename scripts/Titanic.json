They\nresolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express\nelevators.\n\nOne is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking\nlike a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile\nmanipulators.\n\nTILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness\nbelow. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP\n\nPUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to\nits circular viewport to see the occupants.\n\nINSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY\nMIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing\nsoftly in Russian.\n\nNext to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply\ntanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from\nfamous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking\ntreasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer\nand part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2\nscrubber, fast asleep and snoring.\n\nOn the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body\nnamed LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY\nOPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert.\n\nAnatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n3 EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA\n\nA pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR\nONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its\nthrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n4 INT. MIR ONE\n\nLovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing.\n\n                                  ANATOLY\n\n                          (heavy Russian accent)\n\nWe are here.\n\nEXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO\n\n5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of\nsidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters.\n\n6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs.\nBodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge\npointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face\npressed to the center port.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nCome left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen.\nThirteen... you should see it.\n\n                                  ANATOLY\n\nDo you see it? I don't see it... there!\n\nOut of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship\nappears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the\nbottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing\njust as it landed 84 years ago.\n\nTHE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow\nrailing, intact except for an overgrowth of \"rusticles\" draping it like\nmutated Spanish moss.\n\nTIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face\nfills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nIt still gets me every time.\n\nThe image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to\nthe bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns.\n\n                                  ANATOLY\n\nIs just your guilt because of estealing from the dead.\n\nCUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it\nin his hand so it points at his own face.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nThanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.\n\nBrock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera\naimed at himself at arm's length.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nIt still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship\nsitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912,\nafter her long fall from the world above.\n\nAnatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches\nthe sonar.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nYou are so full of shit, boss.\n\n7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while\nMir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive\nanchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps\ngleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous\nwreck.\n\n                               LOVETT (V.O.)\n\nDive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles\ndown. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a\nfreight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine\ninches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds.\n\n8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's\nQuarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nRight. Let's go to work.\n\nBodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick\ncontrols of the ROV.\n\n9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP\nDOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward.\n\n                               BODINE (V.O.)\n\nWalkin' the dog.\n\nSNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind\nit like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect\neyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful\nFirst Class Grand Staircase.\n\nSnoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First\nClass Reception Room.\n\nSNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of\nthe ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move\nthrough the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and\ndescending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at\ntimes it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines\nof a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again.\n\nMONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence:\n\n10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a\nwall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights.\n\n11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as\nSnoop moves around it.\n\n12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then\nsome WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top \"granny shoe\". Then\nsomething eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the\nporcelain head of a doll.\n\nSnoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a\ndoor still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall\nsconce... hint at the grandeur of the past.\n\n13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the\nsitting room of a \"promenade suite\", one of the most luxurious staterooms\non Titanic.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nI'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nStay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nI'm tryin' boss.\n\nGlinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly\npreserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the\nremains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the\nonce elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe,\nscraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud\nof rust and keeps on going.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nI'm crossing the bedroom.\n\nThe remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the\ncollapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took\nalmost new, gleaming in the dark.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nOkay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.\n\nSEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving\ndebris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were\nin 1912.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nEasy, Lewis. Take it slow.\n\nLewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it\nwith Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is\na dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under\nthe door...\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nOoohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?\n\nCLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is\nseeing the Holy Grail.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nOh baby baby baby.\n\n                             (grabs the mike)\n\nIt's payday, boys.\n\nON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a\nsmall STEEL COMBINATION SAFE.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n14 EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH - DAY\n\nTHE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a\nship by a winch cable.\n\nWe are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd\nhas gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a\nhand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited\npartners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover\nhis moment of glory.\n\nEveryone crowds around the safe. In the background Mir Two is being lowered\ninto its cradle on deck by a massive hydraulic arm. Mir One is already\nrecovered with Lewis Bodine following Brock Lovett as he bounds over to the\nsafe like a kid on Christman morning.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nWho's the best? Say it.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nYou are, Lewis.\n\n                            (to the video crew)\n\nYou rolling?\n\n                                 CAMERAMAN\n\nRolling.\n\nBrock nods to his technicians, and they set about drilling the safe's\nhinges. During this operation, Brock amps the suspense, working the lens to\nfill the time.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWell, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the\ntime, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to\ncome out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what\nwe think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.\n\nLovett grins wolfishly in anticipation of his greatest find yet. The door\nis pried loose. It clangs onto the deck. Lovett moves closer, peering into\nthe safe's wet interior. A long moment then... his face says it all.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nShit.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nYou know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\n                         (to the video cameraman)\n\nGet that outta my face.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n15 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION ROOM - DAY\n\nTechnicians are carefully removing some papers from the safe and placing\nthem in a tray of water to separate them safely. Nearby, other artifacts\nfrom the stateroom are being washed and preserved.\n\nBuell is on the satellite phone with the INVESTORS. Lovett is yelling at\nthe video crew.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nYou send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks,\nnot 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.\n\nBuell covers the phone and turns to Lovett.\n\n                                   BUELL\n\nThe partners want to know how it's going?\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nHow it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!\n\nLovett grabs the phone from Buell and goes instantly smooth.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nHi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about\nit, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in\nthe suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck...\n\n                            (seeing something)\n\nHang on a second.\n\nA tech coaxes some letters in the water tray to one side with a tong...\nrevealing a pencil (conte crayon) drawing of a woman.\n\nBrock looks closely at the drawing, which is in excellent shape, though its\nedges have partially disintegrated. The woman is beautiful, and beautifully\nrendered. In her late teens or early twenties, she is nude, though posed\nwith a kind of casual modesty. She is on an Empire divan, in a pool of\nlight that seems to radiate outward from her eyes. Scrawled in the lower\nright corner is the date: April 14 1912. And the initials JD.\n\nThe girl is not entirely nude. At her throat is a diamond necklace with one\nlarge stone hanging in the center.\n\nLovett grabs a reference photo from the clutter on the lab table. It is a\nperiod black-and-white photo of a diamond necklace on a black velvet\njeller's display stand. He holds it next to the drawing. It is clearly the\nsame piece... a complex setting with a massive central stone which is\nalmost heart-shaped.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nI'll be God damned.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n16 INSERT\n\nA CNN NEWS STORY: a live satellite feed from the deck of the Keldysh,\nintercut with the CNN studio.\n\n                                 ANNOUNCER\n\nTreasure hunter Brock Lovett is best known for finding Spanish gold in\nsunken galleons in the Caribbean. Now he is using deep submergence\ntechnology to work two and a half miles down at another famous wreck... the\nTitanic. He is with us live via satellite from a Russian research ship in\nthe middle of the Atlantic... hello Brock?\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nYes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE\nshipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n17 INT. HOUSE / CERAMICS STUDIO\n\nPULL BACK from the screen, showing the CNN report playing on a TV set in\nthe living room of a small rustic house. It is full of ceramics, figurines,\nfolk art, the walls crammed with drawings and paintings... things collected\nover a lifetime.\n\nPANNING to show a glassed-in studio attached to the house. Outside it is a\nquiet morning in Ojai, California. In the studio, amid incredible clutter,\nan ANCIENT WOMAN is throwing a pot on a potter's wheel. The liquid red clay\ncovers her hands... hands that are gnarled and age-spotted, but still\nsurprisingly strong and supple. A woman in her early forties assists her.\n\n                               LOVETT (V.O.)\n\nI've planned this expedition for three years, and we're out here recovering\nsome amazing things... things that will have enormous historical and\neducational value.\n\n                            CNN REPORTER (V.O.)\n\nBut it's no secret that education is not your main purpose. You're a\ntreasure hunter. So what is the treasure you're hunting?\n\n                               LOVETT (V.O.)\n\nI'd rather show you than tell you, and we think we're very close to doing\njust that.\n\nThe old woman's name is ROSE CALVERT. Her face is a wrinkled mass, her body\nshapeless and shrunken under a one-piece African-print dress.\n\nBut her eyes are just as bright and alive as those of a young girl.\n\nRose gets up and walks into the living room, wiping pottery clay from her\nhands with a rag. A Pomeranian dog gets up and comes in with her.\n\nThe younger soman, LIZZY CALVERT, rushes to help her.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nTurn that up please, dear.\n\n                              REPORTER (V.O.)\n\nYour expedition is at the center of a storm of controversy over salvage\nrights and even ethics. Many are calling you a grave robber.\n\nTIGHT ON THE SCREEN.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nNobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave\nrobbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is\npreserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found\ntoday...\n\nThe video camera pans off Brock to the drawing, in a tray of water. The\nimage of the woman with the necklace FILLS FRAME.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\n...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are\nable to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom\nof the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?\n\nROSE is galvanized by this image. Her mouth hangs open in amazement.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI'll be God damned.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n18 EXT.

If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nA hundred and one next month.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nOkay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the\n20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose\nDawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had\ntwo kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is\ndead.\n\nThe Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the\nrotors.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nAnd everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on\nthis ship.

Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her\nout, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh\ncrewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel\nlight.\n\nHOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly\nfragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic\nequipment.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nS'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n23 INT.

Remember, up on deck?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh, yes.\n\nBrock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes\narranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual\nsnapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThere, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel.

Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it,\nthey have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive.\n\nTIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing.\n\n25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a\nshoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines.\n\n26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water.\n\n27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching\npad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly\ndirect.\n\n28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace\nin his hand.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nLouis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the\nCrown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from\nthe neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too...\nrecut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The\nHeart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt was a dreadful, heavy thing.\n\n                        (she points at the drawing)\n\nI only wore it this once.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nYou actually believe this is you, grandma?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt is me, dear.

With a\ntrembling hand she lifts a tortoise shell hand mirror, inlaid with mother\nof pearl. She caresses it wonderingly.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThis was mine. How extraordinary! It looks the same as the last time I saw\nit.\n\nShe turns the mirror over and looks at her ancient face in the cracked\nglass.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe reflection has changed a bit.\n\nShe spies something else, a silver and moonstone art-nouveau brooch.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMy mother's brooch. She wanted to go back for it. Caused quite a fuss.\n\nRose picks up an ornate art-nouveau HAIR COMB. A jade butterfly takes\nflight on the ebony handle of the comb. She turns it slowly, remembering.\nWe can see that Rose is experiencing a rush of images and emotions that\nhave lain dormant for eight decades as she handles the butterfly comb.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nAre you ready to go back to Titanic?\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n29 INT.

She is enthraled by one in particular,\nan image of the bow railing. It obviously means something to her. Brock is\nstudying her reactions carefully.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nThe bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can\nrun a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here.\n\nLizzy turns the chair so Rose can see the screen of Bodine's computer. As\nhe is calling up the file, he keeps talking.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nWe've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay,\nhere...\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nRose might not want to see this, Lewis.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nNo, no. It's fine. I'm curious.\n\nBodine starts a COMPUTER ANIMATED GRAPHIC on the screen, which parallels\nhis rapid-fire narration.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nShe hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along...\npunching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's\nflooding in the\n\n                              BODINE (cont'd)\n\nforward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the\nbulkheads, going aft. As her bow is going down, her stern is coming up...\nslow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that\nweight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't\ndeal... so SKRTTT!!\n\n                (making a sound in time with the animation)\n\n... it splits! Right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. Now the\nbow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow\npulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for\nthe bottom. The stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20\na.m. Two hours and forty minutes after the collision.\n\nThe animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. Rose watches this\nclinical dissection of the disaster without emotion.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nThe bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before\nit hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM!\n\nThe bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows\nthe stern.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nThe stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the\nforce of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.\n\n                        (indicating the simulation)\n\nCool huh?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThank you for that fine forensic analysis, Mr. Bodine. Of course the\nexperience of it was somewhat less clinical.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWill you share it with us?\n\nHer eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them.\n\nA VIEW from one of the subs TRACKING SLOWLY over the boat deck. Rose\nrecognizes one of the Wellin davits, still in place. She hears ghostly\nwaltz music. The faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, English\naccented, calling \"Women and children only\".\n\n30 FLASH CUTS of screaming faces in a running crowd. Pandemonium and\nterror. People crying, praying, kneeling on the deck. Just impressions...\nflashes in the dark.\n\n31 Rose Looks at another monitor. SNOOP DOG moving down a rusted,\ndebris-filled corridor. Rose watches the endless row of doorways sliding\npast, like dark mouths.\n\n32 IMAGE OF A CHILD, three years old, standing ankle deep in water in the\nmiddle of an endless corridor.

Crewmen move across the deck, dwarfed by the awesome scale of the\nsteamer.\n\nSouthanmpton, England, April 10, 1912. It is almost nnon on ailing day. A\ncrowd of hundreds blackens the pier next to Titanic like ants on a jelly\nsandwich.\n\nIN FG a gorgeous burgundy RENAULT TOURING CAR swings into frame, hanging\nfrom a loading crane. It is lowered toward HATCH #2.\n\nOn the pier horsedrawn vehicles, motorcars and lorries move slowly through\nthe dense throng. The atmosphere is one of excitement and general\ngiddiness. People embrace in tearful farewells, or wave and shout bon\nvoyage wishes to friends and relatives on the decks above.\n\nA white RENAULT, leading a silver-gray DAIMLER-BENZ, pushes through the\ncrowd leaving a wake in the press of people. Around the handsome cars\npeople are streaming to board the ship, jostling with hustling seamen and\nstokers, porters, and barking WHITE STAR LINE officials.\n\nThe Renault stops and the LIVERIED DRIVER scurries to open the door for a\nYOUNG WOMAN dressed in a stunning white and purple outfit, with an enormous\nfeathered hat. She is 17 years old and beautiful, regal of bearing, with\npiercing eyes.\n\nIt is the girl in the drawing. ROSE. She looks up at the ship, taking it in\nwith cool appraisal.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI don't see what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look any bigger than the\nMauretania.\n\nA PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON\nHOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. \"Cal\" is\nhandsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYou can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over\na hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has\nsquash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.\n\nCal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who\ndescends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress,\nfrom one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and\nrules her household with iron will.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYour daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.\n\n                           (indicating a puddle)\n\nMind your step.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\n                         (gazing at the leviathan)\n\nSo this is the ship they say is unsinkable.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nIt is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.\n\nCal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience.\n\nThis entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a\nquintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with\nservants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an\nundertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and\nRose.\n\nA WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute\nloading.\n\n                                  PORTER\n\nSir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round\nthat way--\n\nCal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver.

We'll have all this lot up\nin the rooms.\n\nThe White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer\ntrunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates\nand steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who\ncome running.\n\nCal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his\npocket watch.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nWe'd better hurry. This way, ladies.\n\nHe indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the\ncrowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her\nmistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage\nhandlers.\n\nCal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers\n(mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the first\nclass passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by\nusing an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above.\n\nThey pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds,\nqueued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER\nexamines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice.\n\nThey pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph\n\"cinematograph\" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father\nfounded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of\nthe Titanic.

They burst out onto the pier and Jack comes to a dead\nstop... staring at the cast wall of the ship's hull, towering seven stories\nabove the wharf and over an eighth of a mile long. The Titanic is\nmonstrous.\n\nFabrizio runs back and grabs Jack, and they sprint toward the third class\ngangway aft, at E deck. They reach the bottom of the ramp just as SIXTH\nOFFICER MOODY detaches it at the top. It starts to swing down from the\ngangway doors.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWait!!

BRUCE ISMAY, Managing Director of White Star Line.\n\n                                   ISMAY\n\n...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keel\nplates up.\n\nHe indicates a handsome 39 year old Irish gentlemen to his right, THOMAS\nANDREWS, of Harland and Wolf Shipbuilders.\n\nWIDER, showing the group assembled for lunch the next day. Ismay seated\nwith Cal, Rose, Ruth, Molly Brown and Thomas Andrews in the Palm Court, a\nbeautiful sunny spot enclosed by high arched windows.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\n                         (disliking the attention)\n\nWell, I may have knocked her together, but the idea was Mr. Ismay's. He\nenvisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its\nappointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. And here she\nis...\n\n                           (he slaps the table)\n\n...willed into solid reality.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nWhy're ships always bein' called \"she\"? Is it because men think half the\nwomen around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?\n\n                             (they all laugh)\n\nJust another example of the men settin' the rules their way.\n\nThe waiter arrives to take orders. Rose lights a cigarette.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nYou know I don't like that, Rose.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nShe knows.\n\nCal takes the cigarette from her and stubs it out.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                              (to the waiter)\n\nWe'll both have the lamb. Rare, with a little mint sauce.\n\n                  (to Rose, after the waiter moves away)\n\nYou like lamb, don't you sweetpea?\n\nMolly is watching the dynamic between Rose, Cal and Ruth.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nSo, you gonna cut her meat for her too there, Cal?\n\n                            (turning to Ismay)\n\nHey, who came up with the name Titanic? You, Bruce?\n\n                                   ISMAY\n\nYes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability,\nluxury... and safety--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nDo you know of Dr. Freud? His ideas about the male preoccupation with size\nmight be of particular interest to you, Mr. Ismay.\n\nAndrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nMy God, Rose, what's gotten into--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nExcuse me.\n\nShe stalks away.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\n                                (mortified)\n\nI do apologize.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nShe's a pistol, Cal. You sure you can handle her?\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                      (tense but feigning unconcern)\n\nWell, I may have to start minding what she reads from now on.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n60 EXT. POOP DECK / AFTER DECKS - DAY\n\nJack sits on a bench in the sun. Titanic's wake spreads out behind him to\nthe horizon. He has his knees pulled up, supporting a leather bound\nsketching pad, his only valuable possession. With conte crayon he draws\nrapidly, using sure strokes. An emigrant from Manchester named CARTMELL has\nhis 3 year old daughter CORA standing on the lower rung of the rail. She is\nleaned back against his beer barrel of a stomach, watching the seagulls.\n\nTHE SKETCH captures them perfectly, with a great sense of the humanity of\nthe moment. Jack is good. Really good. Fabrizio looks over Jack's shoulder.\nHe nods appreciatively.\n\nTOMMY RYAN, a scowling young Irish emigrant, watches as a crewmember comes\nby, walking three small dogs around the deck. One of them, a BLACK FRENCH\nBULLDOG, is among the ugliest creatures on the planet.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nThat's typical. First class dogs come down here to take a shit.\n\nJack looks up from his sketch.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nLike we could forget.\n\nJack glances across the well deck. At the aft railing of B deck promenade\nstands ROSE, in a long yellow dress and white gloves.\n\nCLOSE ON JACK, unable to take his eyes off of her. They are across from\neach other, about 60 feet apart, with the well deck like a valley between\nthem. She on her promontory, he on his much lower one. She stares down at\nthe water.\n\nHe watches her unpin her elaborate hat and take it off. She looks at the\nfrilly absurd thing, then tosses it over the rail. It sails far down to the\nwater and is carried away, astern. A spot of yellow in the vast ocean. He\nis riveted by her. She looks like a figure in a romantic novel, sad and\nisolated.\n\nFabrizio taps Tommy and they both look at Jack gazin at Rose. Fabrizio and\nTommy grin at each other.\n\nRose turns suddenly and looks right at Jack. He is caught staring, but he\ndoesn't look away. She does, but then looks back. Their eyes meet across\nthe space of the well deck, across the gulf between worlds.\n\nJack sees a man (Cal) come up behind her and take her arm. She jerks her\narm away. They argue in pantomime. She storms away, and he goes after her,\ndisappearing along the A-deck promenade. Jack stares after her.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nForget it, boyo. You'd as like have angels fly out o' yer arse as get next\nto the likes o' her.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n61 INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON - NIGHT\n\nSLOWLY PUSHING IN ON ROSE as she sits, flanked by people in heated\nconversation. Cal and Ruth are laughing together, while on the other side\nLADY DUFF-GORDON is holding forth animatedly. We don't hear what they are\nsaying. Rose is staring at her plate, barely listening to the\ninconsequential babble around her.\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nI saw my whole life as if I'd already lived it... an endless parade of\nparties and cotillions, yachts and polo matches... always the same narrow\npeople, the same mindless chatter. I felt like I was standing at a great\nprecipice, with no one to pull me back, no one who cared... or even\nnoticed.\n\nANGLE BENEATH TABLE showing Rose's hand, holding a tiny fork from her crab\nsalad. She pokes the crab-fork into the skin of her arm, harder and harder\nuntil it draws blood.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n62 INT. CORRIDOR / B DECK - NIGHT\n\nRose walks along the corridor. A steward coming the other way greets her,\nand she nods with a slight smile. She is perfectly composed.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n63 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nShe enters the room. Stands in the middle, staring at her reflection in the\nlarge vanity mirror. Just stands there, then--\n\nWith a primal, anguished cry she claws at her throat, ripping off her pearl\nnecklace, which explodes across the room. In a frenzy she tears at herself,\nher clothes, her hair... then attacks the room. She flings everything off\nthe dresser and it flies clattering against the wall. She hurls a\nhandmirror against the vanity, cracking it.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n64 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE, AFT - NIGHT\n\nRose runs along the B deck promenade. She is dishevelled, her hair flying.\nShe is crying, her cheeks streaked with tears. But also angry, furious!\nShaking with emotions she doesn't understand... hatred, self-hatred,\ndesperation. A strolling couple watch her pass. Shocked at the emotional\ndisplay in public.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n65 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT\n\nJack is kicked back on one of the benches gazing at the stars blazing\ngloriously overhead. Thinking artist thoughts and smoking a cigarette.\n\nHearing something, he turns as Rose runs up the stairs from the well deck.\nThey are the only two on the stern deck, except for QUARTERMASTER ROWE,\ntwenty feet above them on the docking bridge catwalk. She doesn't see Jack\nin the shadows, and runs right past him.\n\nTRACKING WITH ROSE as she runs across the deserted fantail. Her breath\nhitches in an occasional sob, which she suppresses. Rose slams against the\nbase of the stern flagpole and clings there, panting. She stares out at the\nblack water.\n\nThen starts to climb over the railing. She has to hitch her long dress way\nup, and climbing is clumsy. Moving methodically she turns her body and gets\nher heels on the white-painted gunwale, her back to the railing, facing out\ntoward blackness. 60 feet below her, the massive propellers are churning\nthe atlantin into white foam, and a ghostly wake trails off toward the\nhorizon.\n\nIN A LOW ANGLE, we see Rose standing like a figurehead in reverse. Below\nher are the huge letters of the name \"TITANIC\".\n\nShe leans out, her arms straightening... looking down hypnotized, into the\nvortex below her. Her dress and hair are lifted by the wind of the ship's\nmovement. The only sound, above the rush of water below, is the flutter and\nsnap of the big Union Jack right above her.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nDon't do it.\n\nShe whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for\nher eyes to focus.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nStay back! Don't come any closer!\n\nJack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern\nrunning lights.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nTake my hand. I'll pull you back in.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nNo! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNo you won't.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWhat do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will\nnot do. You don't know me.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.\n\nRose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she\nwipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou're distracting me. Go away.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nDon't be absurd. You'll be killed.\n\nHe takes off his jacket.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI'm a good swimmer.\n\nHe starts unlacing his left shoe.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe fall alone would kill you.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIt would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more\nconcerned about the water being so cold.\n\nShe looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHow cold?\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                        (taking off his left shoe)\n\nFreezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.\n\nHe starts unlacing his right shoe.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nEver been to Wisconsin?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                (perplexed)\n\nNo.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there,\nnear Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were\nice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in\nthe--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI know what ice fishing is!\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through\nsome thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down\nthere... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't\nbreath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.\n\n                        (takes off his other shoe)\n\nWhich is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I\nsaid, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over\nthe rail and get me off the hook here.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou're crazy.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one\nhanging off the back of a ship.\n\nHe slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCome on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.\n\nRose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they\nsomehow suddenly seem to fill her universe.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nAlright.\n\nShe unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He\nreaches out to take it, firmly.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI'm Jack Dawson.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                             (voice quavering)\n\nPleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.\n\nRose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is\nterrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning\nto face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and\none foot slips off the edge of the deck.\n\nShe plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is\njerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand.\n\nQUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for\nthe ladder.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHELP! HELP!!\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI've got you. I won't let go.\n\nJack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing\nwith his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth\nhull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any\nfooting in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS\nagain.\n\nJack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she\nflails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a\ntangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of\nher.\n\nRowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill\nand sprints across the fantail.\n\n                                   ROWE\n\nHere, what's all this?!\n\nRowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and\nsobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her\nknees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage\nman with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and\nstarts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them.\n\n                                   ROWE\n\n                                 (to Jack)\n\nHere you, stand back! Don't move an inch!\n\n                              (to the seamen)\n\nFetch the Master at Arms.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n66 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT\n\nA few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS,\nthe closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right\nin front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with\nLovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie\nevening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed\nblowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is\nhunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more\nconcerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nWhat made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me,\nyou filth! What did you think you were doing?!\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nCal, stop! It was an accident.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nAn accident?!\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.\n\nRose looks at Jack, getting eye contact.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I\nwould have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost\nwent over himself.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYou wanted to see the propellers?\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\n                            (shaking his head)\n\nWomen and machinery do not mix.\n\n                              MASTER AT ARMS\n\n                                 (to Jack)\n\nWas that the way of it?\n\nRose is begging him with her eyes not to say what really happened.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nUh huh. That was pretty much it.\n\nHe looks at Rose a moment longer. Now they have a secret together.\n\n                              COLONEL GRACIE\n\nWell! The boy's a hero then. Good for you son, well done!\n\n                                 (to Cal)\n\nSo it's all's well and back to our brandy, eh?\n\nJack is uncuffed. Cal gets Rose to her feet and moving.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                            (rubbing her arms)\n\nLet's get you in. You're freezing.\n\nCal is leaving without a second thought for Jack.\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\n                                   (low)\n\nAh... perhaps a little something for the boy?\n\n                                    CAL\n\nOh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIs that the going rate for saving the woman you love?\n\n                                    CAL\n\nRose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?\n\nCal turns back to Jack. He appraises him condescendingly... a steerage\nruffian, unwashed and ill-mannered.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI know.\n\n                                 (to Jack)\n\nPerhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with\nyour heroic tale?\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                        (looking straight at Rose)\n\nSure. Count me in.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nGood. Settled then.\n\nCal turns to go, putting a protective arm around Rose. he leans close to\nGracie as they walk away.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nThis should be amusing.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                            (as Lovejoy passes)\n\nCan I bum a cigarette?\n\nLovejoy smoothly draws a silver cigarette case from his jacket and snaps it\nopen. Jack takes a cigarette, then another, popping it behind his ear for\nlater. Lovejoy lights Jack's cigarette.\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\nYou'll want to tie those.\n\n                         (Jack looks at his shoes)\n\nInteresting that the young lady slipped so mighty all of a sudden and you\nstill had time to take of your jacket and shoes. Mmmm?\n\nLovejoy's expression is bland, but the eyes are cold. He turns away to join\nhis group.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n67 INT. ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nAs she undresses for bed Rose sees Cal standing in her doorway, reflected\nin the cracked mirror of her vanity. He comes toward her.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                           (unexpectedly tender)\n\nI know you've een melancholy, and I don't pretent to know why.\n\nFrom behind his back he hands her a large black velvet jewel case. She\ntakes it, numbly.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought\ntonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...\n\nRose slowly opens the box. Inside is the necklace... \"HEART OF THE OCEAN\"\nin all its glory. It is huge... a malevolent blue stone glittering with an\ninfinity of scalpel-like inner reflections.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMy God... Cal. Is it a--\n\n                                    CAL\n\nDaimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.\n\nHe takes the necklace and during the following places it around her throat.\nHe turns her to the mirror, staring behind her.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nIt was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer,\nthe--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.\n\nHe gazes at the image of the two of them in the mirror.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nIt's for royalty. And we are royalty.\n\nHis fingers caress her neck and throat. He seems himself to be disarmed by\nRose's elegance and beauty. His emotion is, for the first time, unguarded.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nThere's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you\nwould deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.\n\nCAMERA begins to TRACK IN ON ROSE. Closer and closer, during the following:\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nOf course his gift was only to reflect light back onto himself, to\nilluminate the greatness that was Caledon Hockley. It was a cold stone... a\nheart of ice.\n\nFinally, when Rose's eyes FILL FRAM, we MORPH SLOWLY to her eyes as the are\nnow... transforming through 84 years of life...\n\n                                                                TRANSITION\n\n68 INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK\n\nWithout a cut the wrinkled, weathered landscape of age has appeared around\nher eyes. But the eyes themselves are the same.\n\n                                 OLD ROSE\n\nAfter all these years, feel it closing around my throat like a dog collar.\n\nTHE CAMERA PUllS BACK to show her whole face.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWell, that's the general idea, my dear.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nSo let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the\nTitanic?\n\n                               (he guffaws)\n\nThat's great!\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\n                                (warningly)\n\nLewis...\n\nBut Rose laughs with Bodine.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\n                             (still laughing)\n\nAll you had to do was wait two days!\n\nLovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have\npassed. This process is taking too long.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nRose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after\nthat?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.\n\nLizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the\nsafe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nThat's enough.\n\nLizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail\nwave goodbye.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n69 EXT. LAUNCH AREA/KELDYSH DECK - DAY\n\nAs the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water.\nLovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weave\namong deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys.\n\n                                   BUELL\n\nThe partners are pissed.\n\n                                   BROCK\n\nBobby, buy me time. I need time.\n\n                                   BUELL\n\nWe're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling\nyou what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to\npull.\n\n                                   BROCK\n\nWell you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...\nwe're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just\nhave to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay?\n\nBrock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past\npart of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from\nBuell, toward a quite spot on the deck.\n\n                                   BROCK\n\nHey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nDon't you mean work me?\n\n                                   BROCK\n\nLook, I'm running out of time.

I've bet it all to find the Heart\nof the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even\ndivorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's\nmemory.\n\n                          (he holds out his hand)\n\nYou see this? Right here?\n\nShe looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary\nshape.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nWhat?\n\n                                   BROCK\n\nThat's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand?\nI'm not leaving here without it.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nLook, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget,\nshe contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they\nare.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nMaybe she wants to make peace with the past.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nWhat past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on\nthe Titanic until two days ago.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nThen we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\n                            (looks at him hard)\n\nYou think she was really there?\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nOh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n70 INT. IMAGING SHACK\n\nBodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE\nLIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of\nthe hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march\npast on the right.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n71 EXT. B DECK TITANIC - DAY\n\nMATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912,\npassing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the\nsunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with\npurpose.\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nAs if I hadn't felt the sun in years.\n\nIT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into\nthird class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare\nat her.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n72 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM\n\nThe social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the\nopulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers\nwith babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages\nand being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing\nchess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an\nupright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it.\n\nThree boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat\nunder the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general\nhavoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces\ntogether in his sketchbook.\n\nFabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive\nNorwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the\nroom.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nNo Italian? Some little English?\n\n                                   HELGA\n\nNo, no. Norwegian. Only.\n\nHelga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and\nJack, curious, follows their gaze to see...\n\nRose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls.\nRose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly\nat this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and\ngives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her,\nsmiling.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHello Jack.\n\nFabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nHello again.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nCould I speak to you in private?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nUh, yes. Of course. After you.\n\nHe motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one\neyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n73 EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY\n\nJack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking in\nsteamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He\nfeels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for\ndifferent reasons.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSo, you got a name by the way?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nRose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.\n\nThere is an awkward pause.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMr. Dawson, I--\n\n                                   JACK\n\nJack.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the\nnerve to face you.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, here you are.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHere I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for\npulling me back. But for your discretion.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou're welcome. Rose.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nLook, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does\nshe know about misery?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have\nhappened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was\ntheir whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.\n\n                                (in a rush)\n\nI just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the\nback rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough.\nNot enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I\nwas over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!\n\n                                   JACK\n\nUh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                           (she lowers her head)\n\nOh God, I am such an utter fool.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat penguin last night, is he one of them?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nPenguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIs he your boyfriend?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWorse I'm afraid.\n\nShe shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nGawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.\n\nThey laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a\nfirst class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSo you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're\nmarryin' this fella.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYes, exactly!\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSo don't marry him.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIf only it were that simple.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIt is that simple.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, I guess I will tonight.\n\nLooking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWhat's this?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nJust some sketches.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMay I?\n\nThe question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She\nsits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each\none an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping\nman, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive.\nHis book is a celebration of the human condition.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJack, these are quite good! Really, they are.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.\n\nSome loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles\nafter them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.\n\nHe snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.\n\nFor emphasis he throws away the two he caught. They sail off.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                (laughing)\n\nYou're deranged!\n\nShe goes back to the book, turning a page.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWell, well...\n\nShe has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid\nbeauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands\nand eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form...\nalmost uncomfortably intimate.

That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take\ntheir clothes off.\n\nShe studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight,\nhalf in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a\nflower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print\nof Georgia O'Keefe.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou liked this woman. You used her several times.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nShe had beautiful hands.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                 (smiling)\n\nI think you must have had a love affair with her...\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                                (laughing)\n\nNo, no!

Get up, quickly before\nshe sits with us.\n\nMolly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nHello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nWe're awfully sorry you missed it.

I need to catch up on the gossip.\n\nRuth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to\ngo up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to\nBruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table.\n\n                                   ISMAY\n\nSo you've not lit the last four boilers then?\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nNo, but we're making excellent time.\n\n                                   ISMAY\n\n                               (impatiently)\n\nCaptain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed\ntoo.

I am.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWell, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what\nit is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like\nIsadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...\n\nShe leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees\nsomething ahead and her face lights up.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n...or a moving picture actress!\n\nShe takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward--\n\nDANIEL AND MARY MARVIN.

You may\nnever see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling.\n\nSUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the\nrail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the\npicture and makes him pose.\n\nMarvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with\nmusic and no dialogue.\n\nSERIES OF CUTS:\n\nRose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead.\n\nJack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming\nfanning him like slave girls.\n\nJack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing,\nturns her head in bored disdain.\n\nRose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out.\nJack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely\nWhiplash.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n76 EXT.

That's a swell place, they even have a\nrollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nA whole ten cents?!\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                             (not getting it)\n\nYeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But\nonly in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the\nreal artists were doing.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                          (looks at the dusk sky)\n\nWhy can't I be like you Jack?

We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster\nuntil we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the\nsurf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSure.

Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit.\nIt's unfair.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThey didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch\nclosely.\n\nHe spits. It arcs out over the water.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYour turn.\n\nRose screws up her mouth and spits. A pathetic little bit of foamy spittle\nwhich mostly runs down her chin before falling off into the water.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!...\nthen roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath\nand PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?\n\nShe goes through the steps. Hawks it down, etc. He coaches her through it\n(ad lib) while doing the steps himself. She lets fly. So does he. Two\ncomets of gob fly out over the water.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat was great!\n\nRose turns to him, her face alight. Suddenly she blanches. He sees her\nexpression and turns.\n\nRUTH, the Countess of Rothes, and Molly Brown have been watching them\nhawking lugees. Rose becomes instantly composed.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nCharmed, I'm sure.\n\nJack has a little spit running down his chin. He doesn't know it. Molly\nBrown is grinning. As Rose proceeds with the introductions, we hear...\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nThe others were gracious and curious about the man who'd saved my life. But\nmy mother looked at him like an insect.

I hope you're ready. What are\nyou planning to wear?\n\nJack looks down at his clothes. Back up at her.

My husband still can't tie one of these damn\nthings after 20 years. There you go.\n\nShe picks up a jacket off the bed and hands it to him. Jack goes into the\nbathroom to put it on. Molly starts picking up the stuff off the bed.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nI gotta buy everything in three sizes 'cause I never know how much he's\nbeen eating while I'm away.\n\nShe turns and sees him, though we don't.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nMy, my, my... you shine up like a new penny.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n78 EXT.

UPPER LANDING / GRAND STAIRCASE AND A-DECK\n\nJack steps in and his breath is taken away by the splendor spread out\nbefore him. Overhead is the enormous glass dome, with a crystal chandelier\nat its center. Sweeping down six stories is the First Class Grand\nStaircase, the epitome of the opulent naval architecture of the time.\n\nAnd the people: the women in their floor length dresses, elaborate\nhairstyles and abundant jewelry... the gentlemen in evening dress, standing\nwith one hand at the small of the back, talking quietly.\n\nJack descends to A deck. Several men nod a perfunctory greeting. He nods\nback, keeping it simple. He feels like a spy.\n\nCal comes down the stairs, with Ruth on his arm, covered in jewelry. They\nboth walk right past Jack, neither one gecognizeing him. Cal nods at him,\none gent to another. But Jack barely has time to be amused. Because just\nbehind Cal and Ruth on the stairs is Rose, a vision in red and black, her\nlow-cut dress showing off her neck and shoulders, her arms seathed in white\ngloves that come well above above the elbow. Jack is hypnotized by her\nbeauty.\n\nCLOSE ON ROSE as she approaches Jack. He imitates the gentlemen's stance,\nhand behind his back. She extends her gloved hand and he takes it, kissing\nthe back of her fingers. Rose flushes, beaming noticeably. She can't take\nher eyes off him.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nCal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                            (caught off guard)\n\nDawson!

D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM\n\nCUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They\nencounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty\nbroad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going\ninto the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low:\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nAin't nothin' to it, is there, Jack?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nRemember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got\na lot of it and you're in the club.\n\nAs they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out\nseveral notables.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThere's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man\non the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate\ncondition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal.\n\n                         (nodding toward a couple)\n\nAnd over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs\nnaughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals.\n\nCal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel\nGracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots\nJack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nAnd that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs.\nGuggenheim is at home with the children, of course.\n\nCal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are\nlooking at Rose like a prize show horse.\n\n                                 SIR COSMO\n\nHockley, she is splendid.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nThank you.\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\nCal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck.\n\nRuth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat\ncoquettishly.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nHow can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch.\n\nThe entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the\nAstor's going through the ornate double doors.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJ.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson.\n\n                                   ASTOR\n\n                            (shaking his hand)\n\nGood to meet you Jack.

Hardly any rats.\n\nRose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nMr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my\nfiancee last night.\n\n                        (to Jack, as if to a child)\n\nThis is foie gras. It's goose liver.\n\nWe see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now\nthey're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous.\n\n                                GUGGENHEIM\n\n                          (low to Madame Aubert)\n\nWhat is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here?\n\n                                  WAITER\n\n                                 (to Jack)\n\nHow do you take your caviar, sir?\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                            (answering for him)\n\nJust a soupcon of lemon...\n\n                            (to Jack, smiling)\n\n...it improves the flavor with champagne.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                              (to the waiter)\n\nNo caviar for me, thanks.\n\n                                 (to Cal)\n\nNever did like it much.\n\nHe looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nAnd where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's\ngood humor.\n\nSalad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and\npicks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nYou find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father\nwas always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was\nborn in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never\nknow what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire\nwhen I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that\nteaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.\n\nMolly Brown raises her glass in a salute.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nWell said, Jack.\n\n                              COLONEL GRACIE\n\n                            (raising his glass)\n\nHere, here.\n\nRose raises her glass, looking at Jack.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nTo making it count.\n\nRuth, annoyed that Jack has scored a point, presses him further.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nHow is it you have the means to travel, Mr. Dawson?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket\non Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.\n\n                           (he glances at Rose)\n\nA very lucky hand.\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\nAll life is a game of luck.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nA real man makes his own luck, Archie.\n\nRose notices that Thomas Andrews, sitting next to her, is writing in his\nnotebook, completely ignoring the conversation.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMr. Andrews, what are you doing? I see you everywhere writing in this\nlittle book.\n\n                           (grabs it and reads)\n\nIncrease number of screws in hat hooks from 2 to 3.

She may be mine on paper, but in the\neyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYour ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nThankyou, Rose.\n\nWe see that Andrews has come under Rose's spell.\n\n83 TIME TRANSITION: Dessert has been served and a waiter arrives with\ncigars in a humidor on a wheeled cart. The men start clipping ends and\nlighting.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                              (low, to Jack)\n\nNest it'll be brandies in the Smoking Room.\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\n                                 (rising)\n\nWell, join me for a brandy, gentlemen?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                   (low)\n\nNow they retreat into a cloud of smoke and congratulate each other on being\nmasters of the universe.\n\n                                  GRACIE\n\nJoining us, Dawson? You don't want to stay out here with the women, do you?\n\nActually he does, but...\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNo thanks. I'm heading back.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nProbably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing.\nWouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.\n\nCal and te other gentlemen exit.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJack, must you go?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nTime for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.\n\nHe leans over to take her hand.\n\nINSERT: We see him slip a tiny folded not into her palm.\n\nRuth, scowling, watches him walk away across the enormous room. Rose\nsurreptitiously opens the note below table level. It reads: \"Make it count.\nMeet me at the clock\".\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n84 INT. A-DECK FOYER-NIGHT\n\nRose crosses the A-Deck foyer, sighting Jack at the landing above. Overhead\nis the crystal dome. Jack has his back to her, studying the ornate clock\nwith its carved figures of Honor and Glory. It softly strikes the hour.\n\nMOVING WITH ROSE as she goes up the sweeping staircase toward him. He\nturns, sees her... smiles.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWant to go to a real party?\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n85 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM\n\nCrow led and alive with music, laughter and raucous carrying on. An ad hoc\nband is gathered near the upright piano, honking out lively stomping music\non fiddle, accoridon and tambourine. People of all ages are dancing,\ndrinking beer and wine, smoking, laughing, even brawling.\n\nTommy hands Rose a pint of stout and she hoists it. Jack meanwhile dances\nwith 5 year old Cora Cartmell, or tries to, with her standing on his feet.\nAs the tune ends, Rose leans down to the little girl.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMay I cut in, miss?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou're still my best girl, Cora.\n\nCora scampers off. Rose and Jack face each other. She is trembling as he\ntakes her right hand in his left. His other hand slides to the small of her\nback. It is an electrifying moment.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI don't know the steps.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nJust move with me. Don't think.\n\nThe music starts and they are off. A little awkward at first, she starts to\nget into it. She grins at Jack as she starts to get the rhythm of the\nsteops.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWait... stop!\n\nShe bends down, pulling off her high heeled shoes, and flings them to\nTommy. Then she grabs Jack and they plunge back into the fray, dancing\nfaster as the music speeds up.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n86 OMITTED\n\n87 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM\n\nThe scene is rowdy and rollicking. A table gets knocked over as a drunk\ncrashes into it. And in the middle of it... Rose dancing with Jack in her\nstocking feet. The steps are fast and she shines with sweat. A space opens\naround them, and people watch them, clapping as the band plays faster and\nfaster.\n\nFABRIZIO AND HELGA. Dancing has obviated the need for a common language. He\nwhirls her, then she responds by whirling him... Fabrizio's eyes go wide\nwhen he realizes she's stronger than he is.\n\nThe tune ends in a mad rush. Jack steps away from Rose with a flourish,\nallowing her to take a bow. Exhilarated and slightly tipsy, she does a\ngraceful ballet ployer, feet turned out perfectly. Everyone laughs and\napplauds. Rose is a hit with the steerage folks, who've never had a lady\nparty with them.\n\nThey move to a table, flushed and sweaty. Rose grabs Fabrizio's cigarette\nand takes a big drag. She's feeling cocky. Fabrizio is grinning, holding\nhands with Helga.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nHow you two doin'?\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nI don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along\nfine.\n\nTommy walks up with a pint for each of them. Rose chugs hers, showing off.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou think a first class girl can't drink?\n\nEverybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy,\nwho sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy\nlunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nYou stupid bastard!!\n\nBjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middle\nof it, pushing them apart.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nBoys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman\ngoin' to the whorehouse?\n\nTommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins\nand claps Bjorn on the shoulder.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nSo, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this.\n\nIn her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up\non point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape\nat her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws\nup in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOooowww! I haven't done that in years.\n\nJack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up.\n\nTHE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through\nthe gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing.\n\nLOVEJOY closes the door.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n88 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT\n\nThe stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way.\nRose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party,\nthey are singing a popular song \"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\".\n\n                                 JACK/ROSE\n\nCome Josephine in my flying machine\n\nAnd it's up she goes! Up she goes!\n\nIn the air she goes. Where? There she goes!\n\nThey fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First\nClass Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end.\nThrough the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose\ngrabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIsn't it magnificent? So grand and endless.\n\nShe goes to the rail and leans on it.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThey're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on\nthe earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this\nlittle tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst.\n\nHe leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the\nslightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that\nsquare inch of skin where their hands are touching.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou're not one of them. There's been a mistake.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nA mistake?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nUh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                (laughing)\n\nI did, didn't I?\n\n                                  (MORE)\n\n                               ROSE (CONT'D)\n\n                            (pointing suddenly)\n\nLook! A shooting star.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThat was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it\nwas a soul going to heaven.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?\n\nJack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It\nwould be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems\nto be thinking the same thing.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWhat would you wish for?\n\nAfter a beat, Rose pulls back.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nSomething I can't have.\n\n                            (she smiles sadly)\n\nGoodnight, Jack. And thank you.\n\nShe leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nRose!!\n\nBut the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n89 INT. ORSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE - DAY\n\nSUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the\npromenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is\npalpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes\ninside.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI had hoped you would come to me last night.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI was tired.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                               (stiffening)\n\nI see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYou will never behave like that again! Do you understand?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your\nfiancee--\n\nCal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He\nmoves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the\nsides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will\nhonor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made\nout a fool! Is this in any way unclear?\n\nRose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the\ndoor bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens\nup. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWe... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n90 INT. RUTH'S SUITE - DAY\n\nRose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her\ncorset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nYou are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it!\n\nRose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the\ncorset strings with both hands.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed.\n\nRuth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK!\n\n                                   RUTH\n\n                             (wheeling on her)\n\nRose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's\ngone!\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOf course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nYour father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good\nname. And that name is the only card we have to play.\n\nRose turns her around and grabs the corset strings again. Ruth sucks in her\nwaist and Rose pulls.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nI don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure\nour survival.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                              (hurt and lost)\n\nHow can you put this on my shoulders?\n\nRose turns to her, and we see what Rose sees-- the naked fear in her\nmother's eyes.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nDo you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you\nwant to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to\nthe winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt's so unfair.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nOf course it's unfair! We're women. Our choices are never easy.\n\nRose pulls the corset tighter.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n91 INT. FIRST CLASS DINING SALOON\n\nAt the divine service, Captain Smith is leading a group in the hymn\n\"Almighty Father Strong To Save.\" Rose and Ruth sing in the middle of the\ngroup.\n\nLovejoy stands well back, keeping an eye on Rose. He notices a commotion at\nthe entry doors. Jack has been halted there by two stewards. He is dressed\nin his third class clothes, and stands there, hat in hand, looking out of\nplace.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nLook, you, you're not supposed to be in here.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI was just here last night... don't you remember?\n\n                    (seeing Lovejoy coming toward him)\n\nHe'll tell you.\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\nMr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of\nyour assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--\n\nHe holds out two twenty dollar bills, which Jack refuses to take.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI don't want money, I--\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\n--and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your\npresence here is no longer appropriate.\n\nJack spots Rose but she doesn't see him.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI just need to talk to Rose for a--\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\nGentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs.\n\n                   (giving the twenties to the stewards)\n\nAnd that he stays there.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nYes sir!\n\n                                 (to Jack)\n\nCome along you.\n\nEND ON ROSE, not seeing Jack hustled out.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                                 (singing)\n\nO hear us when we cry to thee for those in peril on the sea.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n92 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY\n\nAn Edwardian nautilus room. There are machines we recognize, and some\ndon't. A woman pedals a stationary bicycle in a long dress, looking\nrediculous. Thomas Andrews is leading a small tour group, including Rose,\nRuth and Cal. Cal is wroking the oars of a stationary rowing machine with a\nwell trained stroke.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nReminds me of my Harvard days.\n\nT.W. McCAULEY, the gym instructor, is a bouncy little man in white\nflannels, eager to show off his modern equipment, like his present-day\ncounterpart on an \"Abflex\" infomercial. He hits a switch and a machine with\na saddle on it starts to undulate. Rose puts her hand on it, curious.\n\n                                 MCCAULEY\n\nThe electric horse is very popular. We even have an electric camel.\n\n                                 (to Ruth)\n\nCare to try your hand at the rowing, m'am?\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nDon't be absurd. I can't think of a skill I should likely need less.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nThe next stop on our tour will be bridge. This way, please.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n93 EXT. AFT WELL DECK, B-DECK AND A-DECK - DAY\n\nJack, walking with determination, is followed closely by Tommy and\nFabrizio. He quickly climbs the steps to B-Deck and steps over the gate\nseparating 3rd from 2nd class.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nShe's a goddess amongst mortal men, there's no denyin'. But she's in\nanother world, Jackie, forget her. She's closed the door.\n\nJack moves furtively to the wall below the A-Deck promenade, aft.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIt was them, not her.\n\n                        (glancing around the deck)\n\nReady... go.\n\nTommy shakes his head resignedly and puts his hands together, crouching\ndown. Jack steps into Tommy's hands and gets boosted up to the next deck,\nwhere he scrambles nimbly over the railing, onto the First Class deck.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nHe's not bein' logical, I tell ya.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nAmore is'a not logical.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n94 EXT. A-DECK / AFT - DAY\n\nA man is playing with his son, who is spinning a top with a string. The\nman's overcoat and hat are sitting on a deck chair nearby. Jack emerges\nfrom behind one of the huge deck cranes and calmly picks up the coat and\nbowler hat. He walks away, slipping into the coat, and slicks his hair back\nwith spit. Then puts the hat on at a jaunty angle. At a distance he could\npass for a gentlemen.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n95 INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM - DAY\n\nHAROLD BRIDE, the 21 year old Junior Wireless Operator, hustles in and\nskirts around Andrews' tour group to hand a Marconigram to Captain Smith.\n\n                                   BRIDE\n\nAnother ice warning, sir. This one from the \"Baltic\".\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nThankyou, Sparks.\n\nSmith glances at the message then nonchalantly puts it in his pocket. He\nnods reassuringly to Rose and the group.\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nNot to worry, it's quite normal for this time of year. In fact, we're\nspeeding up. I've just ordered the last boilers lit.\n\nAndrews scowls slightly before motioning the group toward the door. They\nexit just as SECOND OFFICER CHARLES HERBERT LIGHTOLLER comes out of the\nchartroom, stopping next to First Officer Murdoch.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nDid we ever find those binoculars for the lookouts?\n\n                           FIRST OFFICER MURDOCH\n\nHaven't seen them since Southampton.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n96 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE - DAY\n\nAndrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats\ntimes the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are\nnot enough for everyone aboard.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nAbout half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in\nthese new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.\n\n                        (he gestures along the eck)\n\nBut it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So\nI was over-ruled.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                       (slapping the side of a boat)\n\nWaste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship!\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nSleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true.\nShe's all the lifeboat you need.\n\nAs they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up\nbehind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns,\ngasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which\nJack holds open. They duck into the--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n97 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY\n\nJack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glass\nwindow to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the\nwoman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJack, this is impossible. I can't see you.\n\nHe takes her by the shoulders.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nRose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that\nyou're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl\nI've ever known and--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJack, I--\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNo wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have\nnothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I\njump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be\nalright.\n\nRose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not\nlike anyone she has ever known.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and\nyou're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause\nyou're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt's not up to you to save me, Jack.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou're right. Only you can do that.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes,\nleave me alone.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n98 INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNG - DAY\n\nThe most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style.\nRose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth,\nthe Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and\nstill as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her.\n\n                                   RUTH\n\nOf course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And\nthe bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been...\n\nTRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on.\n\nREVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four\nyear old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The\nmother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The\nlittle girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse\nof Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to\nbecoming an Edwardian geisha.\n\nON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea\nall over her dress.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh, look what I've done.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n99 EXT. TITANIC - DAY\n\nTITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a\ngiant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack\nis there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He\ncloses his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head.\n\nJack hears her voice, behind him...\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHello, Jack.\n\nHe turns and she is standing there.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI changed my mind.\n\nHe smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the\nchill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nFabrizio said you might be up--\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSssshh. Come here.\n\nHe puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nClose your eyes.\n\nShe does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He\npresses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes\nher two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms\noutstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his\nhands, her arms stay up... like wings.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nOkay. Open them.\n\nRose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like\nthere is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The\nAtlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky.\nThere is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI'm flying!\n\nShe leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to\nsteady her.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                             (singing softly)\n\nCome Josephine in my flying machine...\n\nRose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the\nsea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against\nhis chest. He pushes forward slightly against her.\n\nSlowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers...\nfingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly,\ntheir fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two\nlovers.\n\nJack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her\nwash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear.\n\nRose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms,\nturning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms\naround her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and\ntilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They\nkiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion.\n\nJack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism,\nlifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into\na night without fear.\n\n100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET\nnudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow.\n\n                                   FLEET\n\nWish I had those bleedin' binoculars.\n\n101 JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving\nthe ruined bow of the WRECK--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n102 INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK\n\nOLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present.

Six hours to go.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nDon't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg\nwarning in his fucking hand...\n\n                            (remembering Rose)\n\n... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed.\n\n                                   BROCK\n\n26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough\nto sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too\nbig, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit. Everything he\nknows is wrong.\n\nROSE is ignoring this conversation. She has the art-nouveau comb with the\njade butterfly on the handle in her hands, turning it slowly. She is\nwatching a monitor, which shows the ruins of Suite B-52/56. PUSH IN until\nthe image fills frame.\n\n                                                               TRANSITION:\n\n103 INT. ROSE'S SUITE\n\n... 1912. Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery\nemerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the\nroom. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWill this light do? Don't artists need good light?\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                            (bad French accent)\n\nZat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.\n\n                          (seeing the paintings)\n\nHey...

I saw him once... through a hole in\nthis garden fence in Giverny.\n\nShe goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the\nsafe and start working the combination. He's fascinated.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nCal insist on luggin this thing everywhere.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nShould I be expecting him anytime soon?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nNot as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.\n\nCLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror\nbehind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out\nto Jack who takes it nervously.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWhat is it? A sapphire?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nA diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.\n\nJack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this.\n\n                            (she smiles at him)\n\nWearing only this.\n\nHe looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO:\n\n104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair.\nShe shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders.\n\n105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools.\nHis sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room,\nwearing a silk kimono.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll.\nAs a paying customer, I expect to get what I want.\n\nShe hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stone\nlies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the\nrobe.\n\nJakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor\n(this is all in cuts, lyrical).\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nTell me when it looks right to you.\n\nShe poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember\nfrom the drawing... almost.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nUh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to\nme. That's it.\n\nJack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet\nblushing.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                                (sweating)\n\nHe does landscapes.\n\nTIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his\nsketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is an\nimage she will carry the rest of her life.\n\nDespite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is\nthe best thing he has ever done.

Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanic\nstationary. We don't see what it says.

It\nsteams in the bitter cold of the open bridge.

Quickly, quickly!\n\nThe Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate.\nLovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the\nbars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs\nas Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n113 INT.

Lovejoy runs\naround the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He\ntries the stairs going down to F-Deck.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n114 INT.

He charges toward\nthem. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one\ndoor, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open.\n\n115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down.\nJack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a\nmoment later.

It\nis like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black\nfigures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room,\ndodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                          (shouting over the din)\n\nCarry on! Don't mind us!\n\nThey run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls\nher through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in\nthe dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they\nsee the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the\ninsatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of\nthe fires.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n117 INT.

She\nhugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room.\n\nThey come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down\nto a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim\nand headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color.\n\nRose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal.\nThere are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a\nrose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather\nand wood.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWhere to, Miss?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nTo the stars.\n\nON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat\ninto the back.

The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow.\n\n137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The\niceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the\nsteel plate of the hull flexes under the load.\n\n138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet\nwith a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the\nship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them\noff their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men\nscramble for the stairs.\n\n139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He\nhears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice.\n\n140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING\nTHUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in\ntoward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming\nin about two feet above the floor.\n\n141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in\nastonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain.\nFragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump\nback to avoid flying chunks of ice.\n\n142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws\nthe switch that closes them.\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\nHard a 'port!\n\nJudging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern.\n\n143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the\nswirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The\nroom is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces.\nBarrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down\nlike a slow guillotine.\n\n                                  BARRETT\n\nGo Lads! Go! Go!\n\nHe dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down with\na CLANG.\n\n144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving\naft down the side of the ship.\n\n145 In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making notes in\nhis ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound of a cut-crystal light\nfixture tinkling like a windchime.\n\nHe feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Too\nmuch of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal\nwound.\n\n146 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibrating\non the table.\n\n147 IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up\nher drink to a passing waiter.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nHey, can I get some ice here, please?\n\nSilently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see\nit. It disappears astern.\n\n148 OMITTED\n\n149 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee...\n\n                                   FLEET\n\nOy, mate... that was a close shave.\n\n                                    LEE\n\nSmell ice, can you?

The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to\nreflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just\nhappened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its\nmaiden voyage.\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\n                            (stiffly, to Moody)\n\nNote the time. Enter it in the log.\n\nCaptain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in his\nshirt.\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nWhat was that, Mr. Murdoch?\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\nAn iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full\nastern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and\nI--\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nClose the emergency doors.\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\nThe doors are closed.\n\nTogether they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch points.

He pulls the door open, and steps out into the\ncorridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yelling\nsomething in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting\neverybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n153 INT.

Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one\nof the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nTurn to the right!

Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns,\nthen topping it with sble stoles.

They rech a\nhuge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio\nspots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with\nsuitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him.\n\nTommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group.

Rose runs on as the two\nmen grab Cal, restraining him. She runs throught the First Class entrance.\n\nCal breaks free and runs after her. He reaches the entrance, but runs into\na knot of people coming out. He pushes rudely through them...\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n178 INT.

Its enormous mass is\nsuddenly threatening to those in the tiny boat. Quartermaster Hitchins, at\nthe tiller, wants nothing but to get away from the ship. Unfortunately his\ntwo seamen can't row.

STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS\n\nRose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She\nclimbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The\nweight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and\nshimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her\nstockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in--\n\n191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward.\nShe is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as\nthe ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHello? Somebody?!\n\nShe turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall\nslopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of\nthe water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the\nwater, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his\neyes crazed...\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHelp me! We need help!\n\nHe doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with\nterrifying sounds.\n\nThe lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they\ncome back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of\nblackness was the most terrifying of her life.\n\nA STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is\nupset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by the\narm, pulling her with him like a wayward child.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nCome on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWait.

You're going the wrong way!\n\nHe's not listening. And he won't let her go.\n\nShe SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the\nnose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nTo Hell with you!\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nSee you there, buster!\n\nThe steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just\nthe way Jack taugh: her.\n\nShe turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks the\nglass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes\nthe axe, running back the way she came.\n\n192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the\nbottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the\ncorridor to the room where Jack is trapped.\n\nRose plunges into the water, which is up to her waist... and powers\nforward, holding the axe above her head in two hands. She grimaces at the\npain from the literally freezing water.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n193 INT.

He positions the\nchain connecting the two cuffs, stretching it taut across the steel pipe.\nThe chain is of course very short, and his exposed wrists are on either\nside of it.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nTry a couple practice swings.\n\nRose hefts the axe and thunks it into a wooden cabinet.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNow try to hit the same mark again.\n\nShe swings hard and the blade thunks in four inches from the mark.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nOkay, that's enough practice.\n\nHe winces, bracing himself as she raises the axe. She has to hit a target\nabout an inch wide with all the foce she can muster, with his hands on\neither side.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                              (sounding calm)\n\nYou can do it, Rose. Hit it as hard as you can, I trust you.\n\nJack closes his eyes. So does she.\n\nThe axe comes down. K-WHANG! Rose gingerly opens her eyes looks... Jack is\ngrinning with two separate cuffs.\n\nRose drops the axe, all the strength going out of her.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNice work, there, Paul Bunyan.\n\nHe climbs down into the water next to her.

Rose starts toward the stiars going up, but\nJack stops her. There is only about a foot of the stairwell opening\nvisible.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nToo deep. We gotta find another way out.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n194 EXT.

We see them, gold on black, rippling and dimming to a pale green\nas they go deeper.\n\n195 IN BOAT SIX, Ruth looks back at the Titanic, transfixed by the sight of\nthe dying liner. The bowsprit is now barely above the waterline. Another of\nBoxhall's rockets EXPLODES overhead. K-BOOM! It lights up the whole area,\nand we see half a dozen boats in the water, spreading out from the ship.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nNow there's somethin' you don't see every day.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n196 INT.

Right now steerage passengers move\nalong it like refugees, heading aft.\n\nCRASH! A wooden doorframe splinters and the door bursts open under the\nforce of Jack's shoulder. Jack and Rose stumble through, into the corridor.\nA STEWARD, who was nearby herding people along, marches over.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nHere you!

The pace of work is more frantic. You see crew and officers running\nnow to work the davits, their previous complacency gone.\n\nCAL pushes through the crowd, scanning for Rose. Around him is chaos and\nconfusion. A woman is calling for a child who has become seperated from the\ncrowd. A man is shouting over people's heads. A woman takes hold of Second\nOfficer Lightoller's arm as he is about to launch Boat 10.\n\n                                   WOMAN\n\nWill you hold the boat a moment?

They embrace gently.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nLower away!!\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n198 EXT. BRIDGE / FORWARD WELL DECK / FOC'SLE\n\nAT THE BOW... the place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railing\ngoes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on\nthe foc'sle deck.\n\nSmith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water is\nshipped over the sides and the well deck is awash. Two men run across the\ndeck, their feet sending up spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires another\nrocket. WHOOSH!\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n199 OMITTED\n\n200 OMITTED\n\n201 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL\n\nFabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack's voice.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nFabrizio! Fabri!\n\nFabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He and\nJack hug like brothers.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nThe boats are all going.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWe gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?\n\nFabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the\nstairwell.\n\nTommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of\nthe stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are\nsqueezing through.\n\n                                STEWARD #2\n\nWomen only. No men. No men!!\n\nBut some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through the\ngap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back,\nshoving and punching them.\n\n                                STEWARD #2\n\nGet back! Get back you lot!\n\n                             (to the crewmen)\n\nLock it!!\n\nThey struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes a\nsmall revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a cry\ngoes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and\nshouting in several languages.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nFor the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so we\ncan have a chance!\n\nBut the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out of\nhand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way back\nthrough the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose and\nFabrizio.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nIt's hopeless that way.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWell, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.\n\nFabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\n                       (with a lot of hand gestures)\n\nEveryone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go to\nthe boats. Capito? Come now!\n\nThey can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUF\nDAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, and\nwill not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nHelga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to\ngo to America.\n\nShe kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack lays a hand on\nhis shoulder, his eyes saying \"Let's go\".\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nI will never forget you.\n\nHe turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking back Fabrizio\nsees her face disappear into the crowd.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n202 OMITTED\n\n203 OMITTED\n\n204 INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE\n\nCLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls\nout two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out\n\"Heart of the Ocean\", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks\nthe safe.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                       (holding up stacks of bills)\n\nI make my own luck.\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\n                    (putting the .45 in his waistband)\n\nSo do I.\n\nCal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n205 INT. STEERAGE, AFT\n\nJack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They push\npast confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on top\nof an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in\nSerbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling to\nconsole a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and past\nanother man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what\nthe signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently.\n\nJack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before\nthey are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. The\nsteerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nGo to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted out\nthere.\n\nJack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nGod damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!\n\nHe grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts\npulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it\nbreaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the\nstairs between the waiting people.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nMove aside! Quickly, move aside!\n\nJack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE\nwith all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward,\nnarrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose\nsteps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone:\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIf you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job\n\n                                  (MORE)\n\n                               ROSE (CONT'D)\n\nwith the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the\nboat deck... now.\n\nClass wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n206 EXT. BOAT 6 / TITANIC - NIGHT\n\nRuth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors.\nShe rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship.\n\nIt slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is above\nwater forward of the bridge except for the foremast. Another rocket goes\noff, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward\nfrom the ship.\n\n207 AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through a\nlarge metal megaphone.\n\n                                   SMITH\n\nCome back! Come back to the ship!\n\nCHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle.\n\n208 FROM BOAT 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster\nHitchins grips the rudder in fear.\n\n                                 HITCHINS\n\nThe suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nWe got room for lots more.

FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM\n\nThere are still two cardgames in progress. The room is quiet and civilized.\nA silver serving cart, holding a large humidor, begins to roll slowly\nacross the room. One of the cardplayers takes a cigar from it as it rolls\nby.\n\n                                CARDPLAYER\n\nIt seems we've been dealt a bad hand this time.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n212 EXT. / INT. A-DECK PROMENADE\n\nCal and Lovejoy are walking aft with a purposeful stride. They pass CHIEF\nBAKER JOHGHIN, who is working up a sweat tossing deck chairs over the rail.\nAfter they go by, Joughin takes a break and pulls a bottle of scotch from a\npocket, opening it. He drains it, and tosses it over the side too, then\nstands there a little unteadily.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n213 EXT. BOAT DECK AND A-DECK, AFT\n\nPANIC IS SETTING IN around the remaining boats aft. The crowd here is now a\nmix of all three classes. Officers repeatedly warn men back from the boats.\nThe crowd presses in closer.\n\nSeamen SCAROTT brandishes the tiller of boat 14 to discourage a close press\nof men who look ready to rush the boat. Several men break ranks and rush\nforward.\n\nLightoller pulls out his Webley revolver and aims it at them.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nGet back! Keep order!\n\nThe men back down. Fifth Officer Lowe standing in the boat, yells to the\ncrew.\n\n                                   LOWE\n\nLower away left and right!\n\nLightoller turns away from the crowd and, out of their sight, breaks his\npistol open. Letting out a long breath, he starts to LOAD IT.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n214 EXT.

Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems\nto be quite... practical.\n\n215 IN THE WATER BELOW there is another panic. Boat 13, already in the\nwater but still attached to its falls, is pushed aft by the discharge water\nbeing pumped out of the ship. It winds up directly under boat 15, which is\ncoming downt he right on top of it.\n\nThe passengers shout in panic to the crew above to stop lowering. They are\nignored. Some men put their hands up, trying futilely to keep the 5 tons of\nboat 15 from crushing them.\n\nFred Barrett, the stoker, gets out his knife and leaps to the after falls,\nclimbing rudely over people. He cuts the aft falls while another crewman\ncuts the forward lines. 13 drifts out from beneath 15 just seconds before\nit touches the water with a slap.\n\nCal, looking down from the rail hears GUNSHOTS--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n216 EXT. BOAT DECK / A-DECK, PORT, AFT\n\nFifth Officer Lowe, in Boat 14 is firing his gun as a warning to a bunch of\nmen threatening to jump into the boat as it passes the open promenade on\nA-Deck.\n\n                                   LOWE\n\nStay back you lot!\n\nBLAM!

We don't have much time.\n\nCal sees three dogs run by, including the black French bulldog. Someone has\nreleased the pets from the kennels.\n\nCal sees Murdoch turn from the davits of boat 15 and start walking toward\nthe bow. He catches up and falls in beside him.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nMr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a business\nproposition for you.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n218 OMITTED\n\n219 EXT.

This\nway, I'll lead you!\n\nJack grabs her hand and they sprint past Gracie, with Tommy and Fabrizio\nclose behind.\n\nANGLE ON THE BAND... incredibly they are still playing.

Cal slips his hand out of\nhte pocket of his overcoat and into the waist pocket of Murdoch's\ngreatcoat, leaving the stacks of bills there.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nSo we have an understanding then?\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\n                             (nodding curtly)\n\nAs you've said.\n\nCal, satisfied, steps back.

Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring\ninto the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of\nwater cascading into the ship.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nWomen and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir.\n\nEven with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold.\nNear her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBAND\nshe knows she may not see again\n\n                                  HUSBAND\n\nGoodbye for a little while... only for a little while.\n\n                         (to his two little girls)\n\nGo with mummy.\n\nThe woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from\nthem. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion.\n\n                                  HUSBAND\n\nHold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right.\n\nSome of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to\nbe helped into the boats.

Get in the boat, Rose.\n\nShe is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at\nher, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking\ndisplay in 1912.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nMy God, look at you.\n\n                           (taking off his boat)\n\nHere, put this on.\n\nShe numbly shrugs into it.

He sees the emotion\nbetween Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her\nand says...\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                                   (low)\n\nThere are boats on the other side that are allowing men in.

Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to\ncatch.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nGet in... hurry up, it's almost full.\n\nLightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for\nJack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself\nstepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nLower away!\n\nThe two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                                   (low)\n\nYou're a good liar.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nAlmost as good as you.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI always win, Jack. One way or another.\n\n                          (looks at him, smiling)\n\nPity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by\nmorning.\n\nJack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a\nsecond of his last view of her.\n\n222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the\npulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller\ngiving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in\nher ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in\nslow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in\nslow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees\nhis hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot\nbelieve the unbearable pain she is feeling...\n\nRose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face.\n\nSUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches\nthe gunwale, climbing it...\n\nHurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching\nit, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is\nback on Titanic.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNo Rose! NOOOO!!\n\nJack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck.\n\nHockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this\ngutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all\nthought.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n223 INT. GRAND STAIRCASE\n\nTRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints\ndown the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him,\nCal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs.\n\nThey meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nRose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--\n\nAnd all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou jump, I jump, right?\n\n                                   JACK\n\nRight.\n\nHockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked\nin their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND\non him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband\nin one cobra-fast move.\n\nHe RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above\nthem he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES.\n\nThe carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls\nRose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again,\nrunning down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak\npanelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of\nstairs.\n\nHockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes\nsprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and\nreeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n224 INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM\n\nThe bottom of the grand staircase is flooded several feet deep. Jack and\nRose come down the stairs two at a time and run straight into the water,\nfording across the room to where the floor slopes up, until they reach dry\nfooting at the entrance to the dining saloon.\n\nSTEADICAM WITH HOCKLEY as he reels down the stairs in time to see Jack and\nRose splashing through the water toward the dining saloon. He FIRES twice.\nBig gouts of spray near them, but he's not a great shot.\n\nThe water boils up around his feet and he retreast up the stairs a couple\nof steps. Around him the woodward groans and creaks.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                             (calling to them)\n\nEnjoy your time together!!\n\nLovejoy arrives next to him. Cal suddenly remembers something and starts to\nlaugh.\n\n                                  LOVEJOY\n\nWhat could possible be funny?\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.\n\nHe turns to Lovejoy with a sickly expression, his eyes glittering.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nI give it to you... if you can get it.\n\nHe hands Lovejoy the pistol and goes back up the stairs. Lovejoy thinks\nabout it... then slogs into the water. The icewater is up to his waist as\nhe crosses the pool into the dining saloon.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n225 INT. DINING SALOON\n\nLovejoy moves among the tables and ornate columns, searching...\nlistening... his eyes tracking rapidly. It is a sea of tables, and they\ncould be anywhere. A silver serving tolley rolls downhill, bumping into\ntables and pillars.\n\nHe glances behind him. The water is following him into the room, advancing\nin a hundred foot wide tide. The reception room is now a roiling lake, and\nthe grand staircase is submerged past the first landing. Monstrous groans\necho through the ship.\n\nON JACK AND ROSE, crouched behind a table, somewhere in the middle. They\nsee the water advancing toward them, swirling over the floor. They crawl\nahead of it to the next row of tables.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                               (whispering)\n\nStay here.\n\nHe moves off as--\n\nLovejoy moves over one row and looks along the tables. Nothing.\n\nThe ship GROANS and CREAKS. He moves another row.\n\nANGLE ON A METAL CART... five feet tall and full of stacks of china dishes.\nIt starts to roll down the aisle between tables.\n\nON ROSE as the cart rolls toward her. It hits a table and the stacks of\ndishes topple out, EXPLODING across the floor and showering her.\n\nShe scrambles out of the way and--\n\nLovejoy spins, seeing her. He moves rapidly toward her, keeping the gun\naimed--\n\nThat's when Jack tackles him from the side. They slam together into a\ntable, crashing over it, and toppling to the floor. They land in the water\nwhich is flowing rapidly between the tables.\n\nJack and Lovejoy grapple in the icy water. Jack jams his knee down on\nLovejoy's hand, breaking his grip on the pistol, and kicks it away. Lovejoy\nscrmbles up and lunges at him, but Jack GUTPUCHES him right in the solar\nplexus, doubling him over.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCompliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.\n\nHe grabs Lovejoy and slams him into an ornate columb. Lovejoy drops to the\nfloor with a splas, stunned.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nLet's go.\n\nJack and Rose run aft... uphill... entering the galley. Behind them the\ntables have become islands in a lake... and the far end of the room is\nflooded up to the ceiling.\n\nLovejoy gets up and looks around for his gun. He pulls it up out of the\nwater and wades after them.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n226 INT. GALLEY / STAIRWELL\n\nThey run throught the galley and Rose spots the stairs. She starts up and\nJack grabs her hand. He leads her DOWN.\n\nThey crouch together on the landing as Lovejoy runs to the stairs. Assuming\nthey have gone up (who wouldn't?) he clombs up them two at a time.\n\nThey wait for the footstep to recede. A long CREAKING GROAN. Then they hear\nit... a CRYING CHILD. Below them. They go down a frew steps to looks along\nthe next deck.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n227 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS\n\nThe corridor is awash, about a foot deep. Standing against the wall, about\n50 feet away, is a little BOY, aobut 3. The water swirls around his legs\nand he is wailing.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWe can't leave him.\n\nJack nods and they leave the promise of escape up the stairwell to run to\nthe child. Jack scoops up the kid and they run back to the stairs but--\n\nA torrent of water comes pouring down the stairs like rapids. In seconds it\nis too powerful for them to go against.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCome on.\n\nCharging the other way down the flooding corridor, they blast up spray with\neach footstep. At the end of the hall are heavy double doors. As Jack\napproaches them he sees water spraying through the gap between the doors\nright up to the ceiling. The doors groan and start to crack under the tons\nof pressure.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nBack! Go back!!\n\nRose pivots and runs back the way they came, taking a turn into a\ncross-corridor. A MAN is coming the other way. He sees the boy in Jack's\narms and cries out, grabbing him away from Jack. Starts cursing him in\nRussian. He runs on with the boy--\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nNo! Not that way! Come back!\n\n228 DOUBLE DOORS BLAST OPEN. A wall of water thunders into the corridor.\nThe father and child DISAPPEAR instantly.\n\nJack and Rose run as a wave blasts around the corner, foaming from floor to\nceiling. It gains on them like a locomotive. They make it to a stairway\ngoing up.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n229 INT. STAIRWELL\n\nJack and Rose pound up the steps as white water swirls up behind them. PULL\nBACK to reveal that a steel gate blocks the top of the stairs. Jack SLAMS\nagainst the fate, gripping the bars.\n\nA terrified steward standing guard on the landing above turns to run at the\nsight of the water thundering up the stairs.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.\n\nThe steward runs on. The water wells up around Jack and Rose, pouring\nthrough the gate and slamming them against it. In seconds it is up to their\nwaist.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nHelp us! Please!\n\nThe steward stops and looks back. He sees Jack and Rose at the gate, their\narms raching through... sees the water POURING through the gate onto the\nlanding.\n\n                                  STEWARD\n\nFucking 'ell!\n\nHe runs back, slogging against the curretn. He pulls a key ring from his\nbelt and struggles to unlock the padlock as the water fountains up around\nthem.\n\nThe lights short out and the landing is plunged into darkness.\n\nThe water rises over the lock and he's doing it by feel.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCome on! Come on!\n\nJack and Rose are right up against the ceiling...\n\nSuddenly the gate gives and SWINGS OPEN. They are pushing through by the\nforce of the water. They make it to stairs on the other side of the landing\nand follow the steward up to the next deck.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n230 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE\n\nCal comes reeling out of the first class entrance, looking wild-eyed. The\nlurches down the deck toward the bridge. Waltz music wafts over the ship.\nSomewhere the band is still playing.\n\nCAL'S POV: A little girl, maybe two years old, is crying along in the\nalcove. She looks up at Cal beseechingly. Cal moves on without a glance\nback... reaching a large crowd clustered around COLLAPSIBLE A just aft of\nthe bridge. He sees Murdoch and a number of crewmen struggling to drag the\nboat to the davits, with no luck.\n\nCal pushes forward, trying to signal Murdoch, but the officer ignores him.\nNearby Tommy and Fabrizio are being pushed forward by the crowd behind.\nPURSER MCELROY pushes them back, getting a couple of seamen to help him. He\nbrandishes his gun, waving it in the air, yelling for the crowd to stay\nback.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n231 EXT. BOAT DECK, PORT SIDE / ROOF OF OFFICERS' QUARTERS\n\nLightoller, with a group of crew and passengers, is trying to get\nCollapsible B down from the roof. They slide it down a pair of oars leaned\nagainst the deck house.\n\n                                LIGHTOLLER\n\nHold it! Hold it!\n\nThe weight of the boat snaps the oars and it crashes to the deck, upside\ndown. The two Swedish cousins, OLAUS and BJORN GUNERSEN, jump back as the\nboat nearly hits them.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n232 OMITTED\n\n233 INT. STAIRWELL\n\nJack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and\ntorgues around them.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n234 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE\n\nMurdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is\nthreatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at\nthe officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy\nfalls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below.\n\n                                   TOMMY\n\nGive us a chance to live, you limey bastards!\n\nMurdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd.\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\nI'll shoot any man who tries to get past me.\n\nCal steps up to him.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nWe had a deal, damn you.\n\nMurdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal.\n\n                                  MURDOCH\n\nGet back!\n\nA man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind.\nMurdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a\nbullet into his chest.\n\nTommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his\nlife flows out over the deck.\n\nMurdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol to\nhis temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and\ntopples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet\nbelow.\n\nCal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. The\nMONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across\nthe surface.\n\nThe crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat.\n\n                              PURSER MCELROY\n\n                       (calling above the confusion)\n\nAny more women or children?!\n\nTHE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward,\ncradling her in his arms.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                    (forcing his way through the crowd)\n\nHere's a child!

I'm all she has in the world.\n\nMcElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun,\nbrandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the\nboat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nThere, there.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n235 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM\n\nThomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large\npainting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace.\n\nThe room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table.\nBehind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They\nrun through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She\nsees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWon't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\n                       (a tear rolls down his cheek)\n\nI'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                                 (to her)\n\nIt's going fast... we've got to keep moving.\n\nAndrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her.\n\n                                  ANDREWS\n\nGood luck to you, Rose.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                               (hugging him)\n\nAnd to you, Mr. Andrews.\n\nJack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n236 EXT.

Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra\nmembers.\n\n                                  HARTLEY\n\nRight, that's it then.\n\nThey leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin to\nhis chin and bows the first notes of \"Nearer My God to Thee\". One by one\nthe band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody.\n\nWithout a word they walk back and take their places. They join in with\nHartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this\nstill night. The vocalist begins: \"If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to\nthee...\"\n\nTHE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE:\n\n237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he\nwalks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him.\nWithout a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed\nWHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming\nbrass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse.\n\n238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls\nout his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the\nmantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything must\nbe correct.\n\n239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck.\nRose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water's\nsurface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life.\n\n240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a\nbed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at the\nceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room through\na doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast.\n\n241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young\nIRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her\ntwo young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they are\nall warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothingly\nand holding them.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\nEXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE\n\n242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge\nhouse sinks into the water.\n\n243 ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working\nfrantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag\nit under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws\nfuriously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still\nupside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to stay\nwith it.\n\n244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has\ncompletely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as they\nwork, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag the\ncollapsible under.\n\nFabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it on\nas the water rises around him.\n\n245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black water\nclimbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken\nexpression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenly\nand a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He\ndisappears in a vortex of foam.\n\n246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It\npartially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundred\npassengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat\nbecomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people.\n\nAs men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar and\npushes them back into the water.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nGet back! You'll swamp us!\n\nFabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and\npulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is\ndragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back\nto the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water.\n\n247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them.\nHe holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his\nviolin.\n\n                                  HARTLEY\n\nGentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n248 EXT. A-DECK AFT, PORT SIDE\n\nJack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his\nway to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under\nwater and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on.\nPeople stream around them, shouting and pushing.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nOkay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as\npossible.\n\nThey push their way aft through the panicking crowd.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n249 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL\n\nCollapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining\nship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel.\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                         (to the crew in the boat)\n\nRow! Row you bastards!!\n\n250 NEARBY: Fabrizio is drawn up against the grating of a STOKEHOLD VENT as\nwater pours through it. The force of tons of water roaring down the ship\ntraps him against it, and he is dragged down under the surface as the ship\nsinks. He struggles to free himself but cannot.\n\nSuddenly there is a concussion deep in the bowels of the ship as a furnace\nexplodes and a blast of hot air belches out of hte ventilator, ejecting\nFabrizio. He surfaces in a roar of foam and keeps swimming.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n251 EXT. A-DECK / B-DECK / WELL DECK, AFT\n\nJack and Rose clamber over the A-Deck aft rail. Then, using all his\nstrength, he lowers her toward the deck below, holding on with one hand.\nShe dangles, then falls. Jack jumps down behind her.\n\nThey join a crush of people literally clawing and scrambling over each\nother to get down the narrow stairs to the well deck... the only way aft.\n\nSeeing that the stairs are impossible, Jack climbs over the B-Deck railing\nand helps Rose over. He lowers her again, and she falls in a heap. Baker\nJoughin, now three sheets to the wind, happens to be next to her. He hauls\nRose to her feet. Jack drops down and the three of them push through the\ncrowd across the well deck. Near them, at the rail, people are jumping into\nthe water.\n\nThe ship GROANS and SHUDDERS. The man ahead of Jack is walking like a\nzombie.\n\n                                    MAN\n\nYeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n252 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL\n\nThe stay cables along the top of the funnel snap, and they lash like steel\nwhips down into the water. Cal watches as the funnel topples from its\nmounts. Falling like a temple pillar twenty eight feet across it whomps\ninto the water with a tremendous splash. People swimming underneath it\ndisappear in an instant.\n\nFabrizio, a few feet away, is hurled back by a huge wave. He comes up,\ngasping... still swimming. The water pouring into the open end of the\nfunnel draws in several swimmers. The funnel sinks, disappearing, but--\n\nHundreds of tons of water pour down through the 30 foot hole where the\nfunnel stood, thundering down into the belly of the ship. A whirlpool\nforms, a hole in the ocean, like at enormous toiler-flush. T. W. McCauley,\nthe gym instructor swims in a frenzy as the vortex draws him in. He is\nsucked down like a spider going down a drain.\n\nFabrizio, nearby, swims like Hell as more people are sucked down behind\nhim. He manages to get clear. He's going to live no matter what it takes.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n253 INT. BOAT DECK FOYER / GRAND STAIRCASE\n\nWater raors through the doors and windows, cascading down the stairs like a\nrapids. John Jacob Astor is swept down the marble steps to A-Deck, which is\nalready flooded... a roiling vortex. He grabs the headless cherub at the\nbottom of the staircase and wraps his arms around it.\n\nAstor looks up in time to see the 30 foot glass dome overhead EXPLOSE\nINWARD with the wave of water washing over it. A Niagara of sea water\nthunders down into the room, blasting through the first class opulence. IT\nis the Armageddon of elegance.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n254 OMITTED\n\n255 INT. BELOWDECKS\n\nThe flooding is horrific. Walls and doors are splintered like kindling.\nWater roars down corridors with pile-driver force.\n\nThe CARTMELL FAMILY is at the top of a stairwell, jammed against a locked\ngate like Jack and Rose were. Water boils up the stairwell behind them.\nBert Cartmell shakes the gate futilely, shouting for help. Little Cora\nwails as the water boils up around them all.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n256 EXT. STERN\n\nRose and Jack struggle to climb the well deck stairs as the ship tilts.\nDrunk Baker Joughin puts a hand squarely on Rose's butt and shoves her up\nonto the deck.\n\n                                  JOUGHIN\n\nSorry, miss!\n\nHundreds of people are already on the poop deck, and more are pouring up\nevery second. Jack and Rose cling together as tehy struggle across the\ntilting deck.\n\n257 As the bow goes down, the STERN RISES. IN BOAT 2, which is just off the\nstern, passengers gape as the giant bronze propellers rise out of the water\nlike gods of the deep, FILLING FRAME behind them.\n\nPeople are JUMPING from the well deck, the poop deck, the gangway doors.\nSome hit debris in the water and are hurt or killed.\n\n258 OMITTED\n\n259 OMITTED\n\n260 EXT. STERN\n\nON THE POOP DECK Jack and Rose struggle aft as the angle increases.\nHundreds of passengers, clinging to every fixed object on deck, huddle on\ntheir knees around FATHER BYLES, who has his voice raised in prayer. They\nare praying, sobbing, or just staring at nothing, their minds blank with\ndread.\n\nPulling himself from handhold to handhold, Jack tugs Rose aft along the\ndeck.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCome on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.\n\nThey struggle on, pushing through the praying people. A MAN loses his\nfooting ahead and slides toward them. Jack helps him.\n\n261 THE PROPELLERS are twenty feet above the water and rising faster.\n\n262 JACK AND ROSE make it to the stern rail, right at the base of the\nflagpole. They grip the rai, jammed in between other people. It is the spot\nwhere Jack pulled her back onto the ship, just two night... and a\nliftime... ago.\n\nAbove the wailing and sobbing, Father Byles' voice carries, cracking with\nemotion.\n\n                               FATHER BYLES\n\n...and I saw new heavens and a new earth. The former heavens and the former\nearth had passed away and the sea was no longer.\n\nThe lights flicker, threatening to go out. Rose grips Jack as the stern\nrises into a night sky ablaze with stars.\n\n                               FATHER BYLES\n\nI also saw a new Jerusalem, the holy city coming down out of heaven from\nGod, beautiful as a bride prepared to meet her husband. I heard a loud\nvoice from the throne ring out this is God's dwelling among men. He shall\ndwell with them and they shall be his people and He shall be their God who\nis alway with them.\n\nRose stares about her at the faces of the doomed. Near them are the DAHL\nFAMILY, clinging together stoically. Helga looks at her briefly, and her\neyes are infinitely sad.\n\nRose sees a young mother next to her, clutching her five year old son, who\nis crying in terror.\n\n                                  MOTHER\n\nShhh. Don't cry. It'll be over soon, darling. It'll all be over soon.\n\n                               FATHER BYLES\n\nHe shall wipe every tear from their eyes. And there shall be no more death\nor mourning, crying out or pain, for the former world has passed away.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\nINT. SHIP-- VARIOUS\n\nAs the ship tilts further everything not bolted down inside shifts.\n\n263 CUPBOARDS burst open in the pantry showering the floor with tons of\nchina. A PIANO slides across the floor, crashing into a wall. FURNITURE\ntumbles across the Smoking Room floor.\n\n264 ON THE A-DECK PROMENADE passengers lose their grip and slide down the\nwooden deck like a bobsled run, hundreds of feet before they hit the water.\nTRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, slips as she struggles along the railing and\nslides away screaming.\n\n265 AT THE STERN the propellers are 100 feet out of the water and rising.\nPanicking people leap from the poop deck rail, fall screaming and hit the\nwater like mortar rounds. A man falls from the poop deck, hitting the\nbronze hub of the starboard propeller with a sickening smack.\n\n266 SWIMMERS LOOK UP and see the stern towering over them like a monolith,\nthe propellers rising against the stars. 110 feet. 120.\n\n267 AT THE STERN RAIL a man jumps. IN HIS POV we fall seemingly forever,\nright past one of the giant screws. The water rushes up--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\nEXT. TITANIC / BOAT 6\n\n268 TRACKING SLOWLY IN on Ruth as the sounds of the dying ship and the\nscreaming people come across the water.\n\n269 REVERSE / HER POV: IN A WIDE SHOT we see the spectacle of the Titanic,\nher lights blazing, reflecting in the still water. Its stern is high in the\nair, angles up over forty five degrees. The propellers are 150 feet out of\nthe water. Over a thousand passengers cling to the decks, looking from a\ndistance like a swarm of bees.\n\nThe image is shocking, unbelieveable, unthinkable. Ruth stares at the\nspectacle, unable to frame it or put it into any proportion.\n\n                                MOLLY BROWN\n\nGod Almighty.\n\nThe great liner's lights flicker.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n270 INT. ENGINE ROOM\n\nIn darkness Chief Engineer Bell hangs onto a pipe at the master braker\npanel. Around him men climb through tilted cyclopean mahcines with electric\nhand-torches. It is a black hell of breaking pipes, spraying water, and\ngroaning machinery threatening to tear right out of its bedplates.\n\nWater sprays down, hitting the breaker panel, but Bell will not leave his\npost. CLUNK. The breakers kick. He slams them in again and-- WHOOM! a blast\nof light! Something melts and arcing fills the engine room with nightmarish\nlight--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n271 EXT. TITANIC\n\nWIDE SHOT. The lights go out all over the ship. Titanic becomes a vast\nblack silhouette against the stars.\n\nIN COLLAPSIBLE C: BRUCE ISMAY has his back to the ship, unable to watch the\ngreat steamer die. He is catatonic with remorse, his mind overloaded. He\ncan avert his eyes, but he can't block out the sounds of dying people and\nmachinery.\n\nA loud CRACKING REPORT comes across the water.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n272 EXT. BOAT DECK\n\nNear the third funnel a man clutches the ship's rail. He stares down as the\nDECK SPLITS right between his feet. A yawning chasm opens with a THUNDER of\nbreaking steel\n\nLOVEJOY is clutching the railing on the roof of the Officers' Mess. He\nwatches in horror as the ship's structure RIPS APART right in front of him.\nHe gapes down into a widening maw, seeing straight down into the bowels of\nthe ship, amid a BOOMING CONCUSSION like the sound of artillery. People\nfalling into the widening crevasse look like dolls.\n\nThe stay cables on the funnel part and snap across the decks like whips,\nripping off davits and ventilators. A man is hit by a whipping cable and\nsnatched OUT OF FRAME. Another cable smashes the rail next to Lovejoy and\nit rips free. He falls backward into the pit of jagged metal.\n\nFires, explosions and sparks light the yawning chasm as the hull splits\ndown through nine decks to the keel. The sea pours into the gaping wound--\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n273 INT. ENGINE ROOM\n\nIt is a thundering black hell. Men scream as monstrous machinery comes\napart around them, steel frames twisting like taffy. Their torches\nilluminate the roaring, foaming demon of water as it races at the through\nthe manchines. Trying to climb they are overtaken in seconds.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n274 EXT. TITANIC - NIGHT\n\nThe STERN ALF of the ship, almost four hundred feet long, falls back toward\nthe water. On the poop deck everyone screams as they feel themselves\nplummeting. The sound goes up like the roar of fans at a baseball stadium\nwhen a run is scored.\n\nSwimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as\nthey see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive\nstern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and\npushing out a mighty wave of displaced water.\n\nJack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship\nseemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation.\n\n                              SEVERAL PEOPLE\n\nWe're saved!\n\nJack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly.\n\nNow the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of\nthe flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF\nASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches,\nrailings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts.\n\nThe stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty.\n\nPeople start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck,\nscreaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people\nloose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the\nforward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nWe have to move!\n\nHe climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified\nto move. He grabs her hand.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nCome on! I've got you!\n\nJack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the\nrail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as\nthe railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her\nfiercely.\n\nThe stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith\nstanding against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note,\nits buoyancy stable.\n\nRose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea\nat the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over,\nhang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall\none by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of\nthem bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators.\n\nJack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull,\ngripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are\nthe gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern.\n\nRose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them.\nJack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull,\nholding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment.\n\n                                  JOUGHIN\n\n                           (nodding a greeting)\n\nHelluva night.\n\nThe final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking\ndown a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and\nRose.\n\n                                   JACK\n\n                              (talking fast)\n\nTake a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship\nwill suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of\nmy hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me.\n\nShe stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI trust you.\n\nBelow them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the\nboiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last\nthirty feet.\n\n278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name\nTITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the\nwater.\n\nWhere the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n279 EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE\n\nBodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling\nspasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them.\n\n280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding\ntightly to Rose, pulling her up.\n\n281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a\nthousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are\nstunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning,\nshouting... screaming.\n\nJack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air\nbefore people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4\ndegrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form\ndeath by fire.\n\nA man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly\ntrying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him\nrepeatedly, pulling her free.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nSwim, Rose! SWIM!\n\nShe tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her\nlifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind\nof flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nKeep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.\n\nAll about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a\nchorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water\nstretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is\noverwhelming.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n282 OMITTED\n\n283 EXT. OCEAN\n\nJack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nLook for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt's so cold.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.\n\nHis words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them.\nRose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns\nand... SCREAMS.\n\nA DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG,\nswimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes\nbugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland.\n\nBeyond it Rose sees somehting in the water.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nWhat's that?\n\nJack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a\npiece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she\nslithers onto it belly down.\n\nBut when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges,\nalmost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He\nclings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best\nhe can.\n\nTheir breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A\nMAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him\nback.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIt's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.\n\n                                    MAN\n\nLet me try at least, or I'll die soon.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou'll die quicker if you come any closer.\n\n                                    MAN\n\nYes, I see. Good luck to you then.\n\n                              (swimming off)\n\nGod bless.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n284 EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN\n\nThe boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the\nwater. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing\nin the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nStay back! Keep off!\n\nFabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal\nCLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp.\n\n                                 FABRIZIO\n\nYou don't... understand...

You see the\nspirit leave him.\n\nFABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon\nin a tuxedo. The image fades to black.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n285 EXT. OCEAN\n\nJACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's\nofficer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously,\nknowing the sound will carry over the water for miles.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nThe boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They\nhad to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.\n\nShe nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips\nblue and her teeth chattering.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThank God for you Jack.\n\nPeople are still screaming, calling to the lifeboats.\n\n                                   WOMAN\n\nCome back! Please! We know you can hear us. For God's sake!\n\n                                    MAN\n\nPlease... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE!\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n286 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN\n\nIN BOAT 6: Ruth has her ears covered against the wailing in the darkness.\nThe first class women in the boat sit, stunned, listening to the sounds of\nhundreds screaming.\n\n                                 HITCHINS\n\nThey'll pull us right down I tell ya!\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nAw knock it off, yer scarin' me. Come on girls, grab your oars. Let's go.\n\n                              (nobody moves)\n\nWell come on!\n\nThe women won't meet her eyes. They huddle into their ermine wraps.\n\n                                   MOLLY\n\nI don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men\nback there!

They are two hundred yards from the\nscreaming in the darkness.\n\n                            FIREMAN HENDRICKSON\n\nWe should do something.\n\nLucile squeezes Cosmo's hand and pleads him with her eyes. She is\nterrified.\n\n                                 SIR COSMO\n\nIt's out of the question.\n\nThe crewmembers, intimidated by a nobleman, acquiesce. They hunch guiltily,\nhoping the sound will stop soon.\n\nTWENTY BOATS, most half full, float in the darkness. None of them make a\nmove.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n288 EXT. OCEAN\n\nJack and Rose drift under the blazing stars. The water is glassy, with only\nthe faintest undulating swell. Rose can actually see the stars reflecting\non the black mirror of the sea.\n\nJack squeezes the water out of her long coat, tucking it in tightly around\nher legs. He rubs her arms. His face is chalk with in the darkness. A low\nMOANING in the darknes around them.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIt's getting quiet.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nJust a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats\norganized...\n\nRose is unmoving, just staring into space. She knows the truth. There won't\nbe any boats. Behind Jack she sees that Officer Wilde has stopped moving.\nHe is slumped in his lifejacket, looking almost asleep. He has died of\nexposure already.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nI don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to\nthe White Star Line about all this.\n\nShe laughs weakly, but it sounds like a gasp of fear. Rose finds his eyes\nin the dim light.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI love you Jack.\n\nHe takes her hand.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNo... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up.

Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI can't feel my body.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nRose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that\never happened to me.\n\nJack is having trouble getting the breath to speak.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nIt brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.\n\nHis voice is trembling with the cold which is working tis way to his heart.\nBut his eyes are unwavering.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nYou must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will\nnever give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless...\npromise me now, and never let go of that promise.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI promise.\n\n                                   JACK\n\nNever let go.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.\n\nShe grips his hand and they lie with their heads together. It is quiet now,\nexcept for the lapping of the water.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n289 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nFifth Officer Lowe, the impetuous young Welshman, has gotten Boats 10, 12\nand Collapsible D together with his own Boat 14. A demon of energy, he's\nhad everyone hold the boats together and is transferring passengers from 14\ninto the others, to empty his boat for a rescue attempt.\n\nAs the women step gingerly across the other boats, Lowe sees a shawled\nfigure in too much of a hurry. He rips the shawl off, and finds himself\nstaring into the face of a man. He angrily shoves the stowaway into another\nboat and turns to his crew of three.\n\n                                   LOWE\n\nRight, man the oars.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n290 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 14\n\nThe beam of an electric torch plays across the water like a searchlight as\nboat 14 comes toward us.\n\nANGLE FROM THE BOAT as the torch illuminates floating debris, a poignant\ntrail of flotsam: a violin, a child's wooden soldier, a framed photo of a\nsteerage family. Daniel Marvin's wooden Biograph camera.\n\nThen, their white lifebelts bobbing in the darkness like signoposts, the\nfirst bodies come into the torch's beam. The people are dead but not\ndrowned, killed by the freezing water. Some look like they could be\nsleeping. Others stare with frozen eyes at the stars.\n\nSoon bodies are so thick the seamen cannot row. They hit the oars on the\nheads of floating men and women... a wooden thunk. One seaman throws up.\nLowe sees a mother floating with her arms frozen around her lifeless baby.\n\n                                   LOWE\n\n                      (the worst moment of his life)\n\nWe waited too long.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n291 EXT. OCEAN\n\nIN A HOVERING DOWNANGLE we see Jack and Rose floating in the black water.\nThe stars reflect in the mill pond surface, and the two of them seem to be\nfloating in interstellar space. They are absolutely still. Their hands are\nlocked together. Rose is staring upwards at the canopy of stars wheeling\nabove her. The music is transparent, floating... as the long sleep steals\nover Rose, and she feels peace.\n\nCLOSE ON Rose's face. Pale, like the faces of the dead. She seems to be\nfloating in a void. Rose is in a semi-hallucinatory state. She knows she is\ndying. Her lips barely move as she sings a scrap of Jack's song:\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n\"Come Josephine in my flying machine...\"\n\nROSE'S POV: The stars. Like you've never seen them. The Milky Way a\nglorious band from horizon to horizon.\n\nA SHOOTING STAR flares... a line of light across the heavens.\n\nTIGHT ON ROSE again. We see that her hair is dusted with frost crystals.\nHer breathing is so shallow, she is almost motionless. Her eyes track down\nfrom the stars to the water.\n\nROSE'S POV... SLOW MOTION: The silhouetter of a boat crossing the stars.\nShe sees men in it, rowing so slowly the oars lift out of the syrupy water,\nleaving weightless pearls floating in the air. The VOICES of the men sound\nslow and DISTORTED.\n\nThen the lookout flashes his torch toward her and the light flares across\nthe water, silouetting the bobbing corpses in between. It flicks past her\nmotionless form and moves on. The boat is 50 feet away, and moving past\nher. The men look away.\n\nRose lifts her head to turn to Jack. We see that her hair has frozen to the\nwood under her.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\n                             (barely audible)\n\nJack.\n\nShe touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose\ngently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost.\n\nHe seems to be sleeping peacefully.\n\nBut he is not asleep.\n\nRose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nOh, Jack.\n\nAll hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further\naway now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go.\n\nShe closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason\nto even try.\n\nAnd then... her eyes snap open.\n\nShe raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the\nwood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat\nis invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles\nto draw breath, calling again.\n\n292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something\nahead, turning the tiller.\n\n293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to\nJack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps\ntheir hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI won't let go. I promise.\n\nShe releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out\nlike a spirit returning to some immaterial plane.\n\nRose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She\nswims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to\nBLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across\nthe still water.\n\n294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle.\n\n                                   LOWE\n\n                           (turning the tiller)\n\nRow back! That way! Pull!\n\nRose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe\ntakes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips\ninto uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets...\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n295 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH\n\nEXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day.\n\n                                 OLD ROSE\n\nFifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us.\nThere were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six\nwere saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred.\n\nAs she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the\nsalvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality\nof what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With\nher story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first\ntime, they do feel like graverobbers.\n\nLovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond.\n\n                                 OLD ROSE\n\nAfterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but\nwaith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would\nnever come.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n296 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - PRE-DAWN\n\nMATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved.\n\nDISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the\nsurvivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping\nfrom a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth hugging\nherself, rocking gently.\n\nIN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white\nas the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon\neveryone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent,\nSLOW MOTION.\n\nIN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as\neveryone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human\nemotion.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n298 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN\n\nGolden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea\nreflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships,\nare icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n299 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY\n\nIMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters\nCARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face\nblank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's\ngangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship...\nALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad,\npart elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever.\n\nTHE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself,\ncoming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm\nblankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face\nand eyes of a damned soul.\n\nAs Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's\ncabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the\ngauntlet of their accusing gazes.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n300 EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY\n\nIt is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows\nlining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with\nhuddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch\ncover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts.\n\nHe keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward\napproaches him.\n\n                             CARPATHIA STEWARD\n\nYou won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage.\n\nCal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls\nand blankets at one bleak face after another.\n\nRose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. He\nbarely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in\nher eyes.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYes, I lived. How awkward for you.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nRose... your mother and I have been looking for you--\n\nShe holds up her hand, stopping him.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nPlease don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is\nsomething you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I\nfor you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me.\nIn return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come\nto light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased.\n\nShe fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their\nlives.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nIs this in any way unclear?\n\n                                    CAL\n\n                            (after a long beat)\n\nWhat do I tell your mother?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nTell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.\n\nShe stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with\nemotion.\n\n                                    CAL\n\nYou're precious to me, Rose.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nJewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.\n\nWe see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her.\n\nAfter a moment, he turns and walks away.\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nThat was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited\nhis millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol\nin his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate\nlike hyenas, or so I read.\n\n301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She\ngazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming\nher home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly,\nin his mind.\n\n302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54.\nOver 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The\nmagnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an\namazing tableau.\n\nSeveral hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends\nand reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press--\n\nReporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the\ngangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent\nof a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on\nthem as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions.\n\nRose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage\npassengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off\nthe gangway.\n\n                            IMMIGRATION OFFICER\n\nName?\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nDawson. Rose Dawson.\n\nThe officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks\nforward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium\nflashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden\ndisturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to\nembrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The\nreporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode.\n\nRose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the\njostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the\nconfusion.\n\n                              OLD ROSE (V.O.)\n\nCan you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a\nbutterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more\nunimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic?\n\nTRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes\nand the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n303 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH\n\nOld Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of\nthe screens. She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle\nin her gnarled hands.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nWe never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.\n\n                                 OLD ROSE\n\nNo, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now,\nnot to anyone.\n\n                                (to Lizzy)\n\nNot even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But\nnow you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me,\nin every way that a person can be saved.\n\n                            (closing her eyes)\n\nI don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n304 OMITTED\n\n305 EXT.

KELDYSH DECK\n\nA desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. There is music\nand some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunk\nin the aggressive style of Baker Joughin.\n\nLovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comes\nto him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand on his arm.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nI'm sorry.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWe were pissin' in the wind the whole time.\n\nLovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of\nthe ship.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nOh shit.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n307 EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK\n\nRose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows\nin the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost\nas if she is praying.\n\nON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass.\n\nROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Her\nancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes herself up, leaning\nforward. Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below.\n\nLOVETT AND LIZZY run up behind her.\n\n                                   LIZZY\n\nGrandma, wait!! Don't--\n\nROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has\nsomething in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard.\n\nIt is the \"Heart of the Ocean\".\n\nLovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it\nover the railing where she can drop it anytime.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nDon't come any closer.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nYou had it the entire time?!\n\nFLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. The\nphotographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her hands\nin her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace.\nShe stares at it in amazement.\n\nBACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nThe hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I\nthough of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without\nhis help.\n\nShe holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come\nup behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nHoly shit.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nDon't drop it Rose.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\n                            (a fierce whisper)\n\nRush her.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\n                                (to Bodine)\n\nIt's hers, you schmuck.\n\n                                 (to her)\n\nLook, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off\nthe Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is...\nwe're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about\nthis a second.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nI have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs.\n\nThe massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand...\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nJust let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.\n\nHe comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her\nat the stern of Titanic.\n\nSurprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand,\nwhile still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his\nquest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is\nmesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nMy God.\n\nHis grip tightens on the diamond.\n\nHe looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and\ndeep.\n\n                                   ROSE\n\nYou look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is\npriceless, and making each day count.\n\nHis fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out\nof his hand. He feels it sliding away.\n\nThen, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail.\nLovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit\nthe water and disappear forever.\n\n                                  BODINE\n\nAww!! That really sucks, lady!\n\nBrock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE\nLAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy.\n\n                                  LOVETT\n\nWould you like to dance?\n\nLizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars.\n\n308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over\nend, into the infinate depths.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\n309 INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH\n\nA GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures:\n\nRose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio\npublicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose\nwith her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and\ngrandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived\nwell.\n\nTHE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the\nbeach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its\nrollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life.\n\nWe PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile\nshot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else.\n\n                                                                   CUT TO:\n\nBLACKNESS\n\n310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a\nkind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastle\ndeck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like\nwe are flying.\n\nWE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The\nrust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is\ntransformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing\nchandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in\ntie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful.\n\nIN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and\nladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with his\nback to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out toward\nus.\n\nIN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers,\nofficers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence\nof the abyss.\n\n                                                                   FADE OUT\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nTitanic\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0James Cameron\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:37:22.556631"}
