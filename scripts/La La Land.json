It's a horrific traffic jam.\r\n\r\n     Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the\r\n     heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the\r\n     distance.\r\n\r\n     We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after\r\n     another...\r\n\r\n     One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another\r\n     sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We\r\n     move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,\r\n     until finally we begin to hear...\r\n\r\n     ...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]\r\n\r\n     We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.\r\n     The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on\r\n     her radio -- then starts SINGING.\r\n\r\n     Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the\r\n     lane.\r\n\r\n     One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING\r\n     along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-\r\n<b>     FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...\r\n</b>\r\n     Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making\r\n     use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms\r\n     swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.\r\n     We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,\r\n     taking the magic in...\r\n\r\n     Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --\r\n     and the song comes to a dramatic stop.\r\n\r\n     Flash title card:\r\n\r\n<b>                              WINTER\r\n</b>\r\nA1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is\r\n     SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's\r\n     playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious\r\n     Monk's \"Japanese Folk Song\". But he keeps stopping it, over\r\n     and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot.\r\n                              Revision                           2.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>B1   OMIT\r\n</b>\r\nC1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green\r\n     2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of\r\n     \"no\" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer.\r\n     She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system.\r\n     Fast, fiery, full of energy --\r\n\r\n<b>                            MIA\r\n</b>               ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.\r\n               It was pure insanity.\r\n\r\n     Mia stops.

The honking car behind\r\n     her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him\r\n     the finger.

We follow the Customer\r\n    out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We\r\n    don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the\r\n    shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to\r\n    another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...\r\n\r\n<b>                           WOMAN\r\n</b>              Cappuccino, please.\r\n\r\n    Mia nods.

Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.\r\n    Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO\r\n    EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop\r\n    is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...\r\n\r\n    Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: \"MOM\". Mia presses\r\n    \"IGNORE\" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.\r\n\r\n<b>                           MIA\r\n</b>              Shit.\r\n\r\n    Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --\r\n\r\n<b>                           MANAGER\r\n</b>              Where do you think you're going?\r\n\r\n<b>                           MIA\r\n</b>              It's -- five past...\r\n\r\n<b>                           MANAGER\r\n</b>              You'd better be here early tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<b>                           MIA\r\n</b>              Ok.\r\n\r\n    -- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to\r\n    grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table.

The\r\n    Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it.

A blister on her sole.\r\n\r\n8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a\r\n    towel. She hums to herself.\r\n\r\n    The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on\r\n    the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the\r\n    lights. Looks...\r\n\r\n    With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those\r\n    soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups.

A FAT OLD PRODUCER dancing with a\r\n      TWENTY-SOMETHING. A trio of AGENTS glad-handing each other in\r\n      rhythm by the bar. Yep -- every clich\u00e9 is here...\r\n\r\n      Mia tries talking to a pair of WOMEN -- who promptly ditch\r\n      her.\r\n\r\n      Seeing she's now alone, a YOUNG MAN swoops in to hit on her.\r\n\r\n      She makes a hasty exit toward the bar -- but the line's\r\n      obscenely long.\r\n\r\n      She nears the BATHROOM door -- but a COUPLE stands in her way,\r\n      making out.\r\n\r\n      She slips in behind them...\r\n\r\nA13   Inside the BATHROOM, Mia takes a moment. The joy of seconds\r\n      ago is gone from her eyes now. She gazes into the mirror --\r\n\r\n      -- and SINGS by herself.\r\n\r\n      This verse, sung in private, belongs to a new style: less\r\n      brash, and far more vulnerable...\r\n\r\n      Once finished, Mia takes a breath, steels herself to once\r\n      again face the world, opens the door -- and rejoins the\r\n      crowd...\r\n\r\nB13   We MOVE with her slowly now -- surrounded by the party, but\r\n      everything set at a snail's pace, the crazed carousers moving\r\n      in SLOW MOTION. It's the sadness underneath the revelry, the\r\n      pain underneath the clich\u00e9s...\r\n\r\n      Gradually we RAMP UP. Follow Mia OUTSIDE, where we see the\r\n      splash of blue-green that is the POOL -- and a flurry of FAKE\r\n      SNOW falling from above...\r\n\r\n      As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --\r\n\r\n      -- and we PLUNGE WITH HIM INTO THE POOL.\r\n\r\n      This is the climax of the number. Everyone joins in,\r\n      circling the pool -- a swath of color against the black sky.\r\n      Everyone dances, everyone sings -- and the song concludes\r\n      with a blast of fireworks.\r\n\r\n<b>C13   OMIT\r\n</b>\r\n<b>A14   EXT.

They seem to be moving in\r\nsync -- without their even wanting to...\r\n\r\nAnd -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost\r\nslipped into DANCE...\r\n\r\nSebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at each\r\nother. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights\r\nstretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share\r\na look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...\r\n\r\nMia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia\r\nshakes her head: \"Nope\". They make the road their own, growing\r\nmore and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --\r\n\r\n...that they can really dance together.\r\n\r\nJust as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real\r\njoy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer\r\nand closer, looking at each other almost giddily...\r\n\r\n...a sound cuts through. It's a CELL PHONE ring.\r\n\r\nMia and Sebastian turn -- to her handbag, back by the bench.\r\nSnapped out of it, Mia heads over and pulls out her cell.\r\n\r\n<b>                       MIA (CONT'D)\r\n</b>          Hey...

A moment.\r\n\r\n      We CUT TO WIDE. Sebastian and Mia sit side by side. We linger\r\n      here, our two characters framed by the white-and-green\r\n      Observatory, the rest of L.A. stretching out beyond.\r\n\r\n      And then, ever so slowly...\r\n\r\n      ...we FADE TO:\r\n\r\n<b>                                 WINTER\r\n</b>\r\n      A palm tree, a cloudless sky.

We FOLLOW her from\r\n      behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a\r\n      strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've\r\n      seen before, past Parisian-style fa\u00e7ades. Then enters a\r\n      COFFEE SHOP we recognize...\r\n\r\n<b>129   INT.

Different haircut, different way of\r\n      handling herself.\r\n\r\n      The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as\r\n      the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the\r\n      NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee --\r\n                                 Revision                      77.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>                               NEW MANAGER\r\n</b>                On us.\r\n\r\n<b>                             MIA\r\n</b>                No, no, that's fine.\r\n\r\n      Mia hands over a few dollar bills.

It's polished, inviting.\r\n\r\n      The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's\r\n      before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the\r\n      lowest keys once more, then the highest.

We see,\r\n      sitting on the counter, a Christmas card with a photo attached:\r\n      Laura, Harry, and a FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY, all gathered on a couch\r\n      and smiling at the camera.\r\n\r\n<b>135   INT.

CITY STREET - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n      Mia and David walk down a street. A few open restaurants and\r\n      bars, a few other closed storefronts. A lot of old, weathered\r\n      buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs.\r\n\r\n      Then -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC...\r\n\r\n      He looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of\r\n      the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a\r\n      building. Seems to be where the music's coming from...\r\n\r\n      Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like\r\n      a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door...\r\n\r\n      ...and then FREEZES.\r\n\r\n      The sign on the door reads: \"SEB'S\". It's written the way she\r\n      drew it for Sebastian, years ago...\r\n\r\n      Coming up to her side, oblivious --\r\n\r\n<b>                             DAVID (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                This looks fun.\r\n\r\n      David edges past Mia.

JAZZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS\r\n</b>\r\n      Inside, a JAZZ COMBO is tearing through a fast bop chart. The\r\n      seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,\r\n      older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an\r\n      excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the\r\n      Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles.\r\n\r\n      Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the\r\n      images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by\r\n      the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's...\r\n\r\n<b>                             DAVID (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                Mia?\r\n\r\n      She turns to David. Wavering, unsure what to do, she follows\r\n      him as he manages to find two empty seats close to the\r\n      bandstand...\r\n\r\n      The combo finishes. Hearty applause. A young PIANIST rises\r\n      from the keys, waves \"thanks\".\r\n\r\n      And -- just then -- Sebastian appears. Mia looks at him,\r\n      frozen.\r\n\r\n<b>                             SEBASTIAN\r\n</b>                       (taking the microphone)\r\n                Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.\r\n                       (more applause)\r\n                I don't know, I told him to play \"Jingle\r\n                Bells\".\r\n\r\n      The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them --\r\n\r\n      -- and sees Mia.\r\n\r\n      Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first\r\n      time they've seen each other in years.\r\n\r\n      A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.\r\n\r\n      Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --\r\n\r\n<b>                             SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>                Welcome to Seb's.\r\n\r\n      More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.\r\n\r\n      He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at\r\n      Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow\r\n      musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --\r\n\r\n      -- and finally starts playing.\r\n                                 Revision                         82.\r\n\r\n\r\n      A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A\r\n      melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...\r\n\r\n      It's Mia and Sebastian's song.\r\n\r\n      Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.\r\n      This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The\r\n      most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.\r\n\r\n      We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It\r\n      recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT\r\n      that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian\r\n      plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at\r\n      first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in\r\n      perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon...\r\n\r\n144   ...we find ourselves back at that same RESTAURANT... Back when\r\n      Mia laid eyes on Sebastian for the first time...\r\n\r\n      Within this fantasy-flashback, Sebastian finishes his piece.\r\n      We stick on Mia, watching him as his Boss talks to him. All is\r\n      as before, as we remember it... And sure enough, Mia\r\n      approaches Sebastian as he walks near her, and --\r\n\r\n<b>                             MIA\r\n</b>                I just wanted to say -- I saw your\r\n                playing, and I --\r\n\r\n      -- but instead of brushing past her --\r\n\r\n      -- Sebastian decks her with a kiss for the ages.\r\n\r\n      A BURST OF ORCHESTRAL MUSIC. The DINERS in the restaurant spin\r\n      around to face Mia and Sebastian -- and SNAP their fingers in\r\n      time. Even the Boss starts to DANCE. Mia and Sebastian grin --\r\n      and then strut out together, hand in hand... [EPILOGUE]\r\n\r\n<b>145   INT.

We don't hear Mia sing, but the\r\n         music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to...\r\n\r\nB148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the\r\n         journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use\r\n         for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old-\r\n         Hollywood-movie way...\r\n\r\n         Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of\r\n         Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacr\u00e9-Coeur\r\n         and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright\r\n         colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching\r\n         before us... And then a sign -- \"CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE\"...\r\n\r\nC148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club.\r\n         Sebastian plays, on cloud nine...\r\n\r\nC148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes,\r\n         decked in movie-movie glow.\r\n\r\n         We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the\r\n         TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in\r\n         close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell --\r\n\r\nD148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and\r\n         Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen\r\n         around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another...\r\n\r\n         And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like\r\n         all the stars of the galaxy...\r\n\r\n         ...they DANCE.\r\n                                  Revision                        84.\r\n\r\n\r\n      This is the last time we'll ever see them dance, and they\r\n      seem to recognize that, so graceful and poised are their\r\n      movements... Remember -- this is a romance more perfect than\r\n      a real romance could ever be...\r\n\r\n      We DISSOLVE again -- to a projector beam...\r\n\r\n      16mm footage plays on a screen, full of scratches and pockets\r\n      of light... Mia and Sebastian sit down to watch together --\r\n      and we see the following moments in brief, vivid GLIMPSES, as\r\n      we move in closer on the imagery:\r\n\r\n149   The first home... (16mm)\r\n\r\n150   Mia's pregnancy... (16mm)\r\n\r\n151   The newborn child... (16mm)\r\n\r\n152   The child's first birthday... (16mm)\r\n\r\n153   The child's first day of pre-school, all dressed up... (16mm)\r\n\r\n      Everything here glows with the warmth of old home movies...\r\n      These are memories, fluttering by, grabbed at random -- and\r\n      yet all concocted, dreamed up out of nothing... The SCORE\r\n      continuing to sway and taking us right up to...\r\n\r\n154   Sebastian and Mia, husband and wife, father and mother,\r\n      hiring a babysitter because they've decided to go out for a\r\n      night at the movies... (We're back to 35mm now.) The look\r\n      here is unaffected, just everyday. The MUSIC quiets slightly,\r\n      everything goes more natural, as this happily married couple\r\n      hit the road...\r\n\r\n155   ...then find themselves blocked by a traffic jam...then take\r\n      a side route, winding up in another part of L.A...\r\n\r\n156   ...then walk down the street, then hear music -- a jazz combo\r\n      playing somewhere...\r\n\r\n157   ...and step into a place that looks just like Sebastian's\r\n      club... They sit down to listen...\r\n\r\n      And then -- and this is how our imagined montage-musical\r\n      number ends -- the combo's PIANIST, who of course is not\r\n      Sebastian, launches into Mia and Sebastian's melody...\r\n\r\n      ...and Mia and Sebastian look at each other, recognizing it.\r\n\r\n      The music goes full-circle, back to where it started, as Mia\r\n      and Sebastian look into each other's eyes, lean in and,\r\n      softly, but with all the love in the world...\r\n\r\n<b>      ...KISS.\r\n</b>                               Revision                           85.\r\n\r\n\r\n158   WE CUT BACK TO THE PIANO: Sebastian has just finished his\r\n      piece. We're back to reality. The audience in the club\r\n      applauds.\r\n\r\n      Beat. Mia looks at Sebastian. Looks away. A moment passes.\r\n\r\n<b>                             DAVID\r\n</b>                Do you want to stay for another?\r\n\r\n      She's silent for a second. Then she looks at David.\r\n\r\n<b>                             MIA\r\n</b>                No... We should go.\r\n\r\n      He nods. They rise from their seats and head for the exit.\r\n\r\n      Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns\r\n      and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock.\r\n      A hint of a tear in both...\r\n\r\n      And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles.\r\n\r\n      It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but\r\n      it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the\r\n      melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still\r\n      thinks of it to this day...\r\n\r\n      Then she walks out the door. Sebastian glances at his fellow\r\n      musicians. Then, he nods, and they launch into a new chart.\r\n\r\n<b>159   EXT. STREET - NIGHT\r\n</b>\r\n      It's silent outside. You can't hear the music. Mia and David\r\n      reach their car. They get in. It pulls out.\r\n\r\n      Passing by Sebastian's club, the car continues on. We stay put,\r\n      the jazz club on one side of the frame, the lights of the car\r\n      on the other. Those lights growing smaller and smaller, before\r\n      finally disappearing into the big L.A. night...\r\n\r\n<b>      IRIS FADE OUT.\r\n</b>\r\n<b>                               THE END\r\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/La-La-Land.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>La La Land</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Damien Chazelle\" title=\"Scripts by Damien Chazelle\">Damien Chazelle</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Musical\" title=\"Musical Scripts\">Musical</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/La La Land Script.html#comments\" title=\"La La Land comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:09:22.871042"}
