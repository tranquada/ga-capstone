Gives rise to another... \n               and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars. \n               No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS.

The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands \n               a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He \n               shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his \n               hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the \n               background. The player throws...

LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Bernie's 1958 Buick Electra pulls into the parking lot of a \n               flea-bag motel. Next door to the motel, we see a convenience \n               store with the name, THE EZ MARK in pink glowing neon. It's \n               actually supposed to read: The EZ MARKET, but the last two \n               letters of \"Market\" have burned out.\n\n<b>               INT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT\n</b>\n               One of those center pool style motels. A hard luck oasis, if \n               ever there was one.\n\n               As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent \n               HOOKER, approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard \n               with a huge-ass JOHN in tow.\n\n               They converge at their doors at the same time. There's a \n               weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town. She \n               winks at Bernie. He nods at her. Then casts a furtive glance \n               over at the John. The man flips him off. The hooker mouths, \n               \"Sorry.\" Bernie hastily enters his apartment.\n\n<b>               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Bernie flips on the light. A dim overhead bulb hardly makes \n               a dent in the gloomy surroundings. Typical drab motel \n               furnishings.\n\n               We notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to \n               the window. A single place setting on the counter. Something \n               odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. No \n               sign of a cat. Go figure.\n\n               Bernie heads over to the dresser. A half-filled bottle of \n               gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side.\n\n               He pours himself a shot. Turns on the TV. A religious channel. \n               Shitty reception.\n\n<b>               ON SCREEN:\n</b>\n               an Appalachian Pentecostal service. The members of the \n               congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious \n               hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits \n               viewer donations.\n\n               Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel. He takes a \n               seat on his bed, props himself up against a pair of pillows, \n               stretches out.\n\n               From next door, the sounds of wild humping.\n\n<b>                                     HOOKER (O.S.)\n</b>                         ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me.

Oooooh...\n\n               Bernie closes his eyes, tries to ignore the X-rated soundtrack \n               coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls.\n\n               The hooker's moans are starting to get to him. He raises his \n               fist to the wall, then stops himself. He's just not the \n               confrontational type.\n\n               Instead, he heads over to the TV, cranks the volume up. The \n               hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with \n               the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre \n               remix that could only exist in the world of Bernie Lootz. \n               Bernie emits a deep sigh, closes his eyes.\n\n<b>               INT.

A staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years.\n\n               The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, \n               almost tripping over his microphone cable.\n\n               Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, \n               delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions \n               react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in \n               a boxer's defensive stance.

Bare shelves... \n               except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's \n               a Sinatra album. Never been opened.\n\n               Natalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record \n               from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its \n               surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way \n               he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much \n               care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon.\n\n               Natalie can't help but smile.\n\n               Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record.\n\n               Everything seems to be going so well, until...\n\n               SKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record \n               with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard.\n\n               Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious \n               laugh comes out.\n\n               It's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie \n               turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle \n               catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing \n               \"This Town,\" a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. \n               Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch.\n\n               Natalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger.

Some John telling them to keep it down.\n\n               Bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at \n               Natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, \n               convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp.\n\n               Frank winds down \"This Town\" a few seconds later. Poor Bernie, \n               he didn't even make it through the song.\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         Sorry...\n\n               Natalie wraps her arms around him.\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         Don't worry, Bernie.

No sign of Natalie.\n\n               Bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in \n               it. Takes a deep breath. Moans at her scent. Ambrosia.

Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up \n               every light in the house and throws it back at the audience.\n\n               Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr. and the moves \n               of Ricki Martin. The energy this guy brings to the stage \n               makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem \n               like suspended animation. The women in the audience start \n               fanning themselves with delight.\n\n               It's a new dawn in Paradise. And the panties are coming fast \n               and furious.\n\n               We see Shelly watching from the back of the room. He shifts \n               his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table.\n\n               They're having a grand time. Nicky pats Larry on the back of \n               the head. \"Good work, kid.\"\n\n               Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly. Shelly stares \n               right through him. A declaration of war.\n\n<b>               INT. CASINO MIDWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Bernie and Natalie wander around the midway. A middle-aged \n               WORKER at the ring toss booth gets her attention.\n\n<b>                                     RING TOSS WORKER\n</b>                         Over here, young lady!

Natalie throws, and misses all eight.\n\n               The man pats her on the shoulder.\n\n<b>                                     RING TOSS WORKER\n</b>                         Sorry there, sweetheart.

His look suggests she's being played for a \n               sucker. She decides against it.\n\n               They walk off down the midway. Bernie chuckles to himself.\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         What?\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         Nothing.\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         What?\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         Nothing.

When a guy would walk up and \n                         seemed eager to open his wallet, we \n                         would always mark him with chalk. \n                         We'd pat him on the back or arm with \n                         the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good \n                         job!'\n                              (pats Natalie)\n                         Meanwhile, he had no clue the other \n                         guys saw him coming a mile away. \n                         Easy mark.\n\n               Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her.\n\n               She brushes it for effect. Bernie smiles. They take a seat \n               at the end of the midway.\n\n               Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed BOY being dragged \n               around by his OLDER BROTHER and the brother's FRIEND. The \n               kid has a glazed look in his eyes.\n\n               Natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression. Bernie \n               picks up on it.\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         You OK?\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         You notice last night, that tattoo \n                         on my butt?\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                              (are you kidding?!)\n                         Little Joe.\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.\n\n               Natalie hides her face behind her soda cup. Looks off in the \n               distance.\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         I had a son. His name was Joe.

Later, \n                         when I'm already invested in you, \n                         it'll be too hard to come clean. \n                         After I tell you this, you'll \n                         probably... I mean, I'll understand.\n\n               She tears her eyes away from Bernie. Bernie can't believe \n               what he's hearing. That she wants to be invested in him.\n\n               What could be so bad?\n\n<b>                                     NATALIE\n</b>                         I gave my son up for adoption. I \n                         just wanted my life back. I was \n                         seventeen going on eighteen and I \n                         was selfish. My family, they didn't \n                         want to have nothing to do with me \n                         after that. So I hitched a ride out \n                         here. Figured I could make it as a \n                         showgirl. Ten years later...\n                              (shrugs; starts to \n                              break up)\n                         I like to think that if it happened \n                         when I was older -- with some guy I \n                         cared about -- maybe things would \n                         have been different. I think about \n                         my Little Joe. And, I do know he's \n                         better off. I'm convinced of that.\n\n               She lowers her soda. Turns to Bernie. He studies her for a \n               lengthy beat, stoic features. She wipes away her tears. Oh \n               well, that's that. Bernie stands up. Looks around... focuses \n               on the arcade clock. It reads 1:40 a.m. He turns to her...\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         So, you wanna go try your hand at \n                         the dime pitch?

Natalie doesn't \n               make with the \"Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great\" \n               encouragement. Just some low key moans. Bernie doesn't come \n               too soon either. He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts.\n\n               In contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away \n               through the walls. An escalating ostinato of \"Oh Baby's.\"\n\n               Until Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against \n               the wall. Big smile from both of them.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Natalie climbs out, heads \n               for the room.\n\n               Natalie arrives at the room. She's about to stab the key in \n               the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar.

No Natalie. Just her \n               impression in the sheets. And a note on her pillow. For a \n               moment his heart stops. He conjures up the worst.

PAN UP to Bernie \n               dancing with himself. He's positively aglow. He snatches up \n               a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra. It's true -- \n               love makes the world go around. It obviously also gives life \n               to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung \n               up overnight above his radiator.

Paralyzed with terror, she still \n               manages a bittersweet smile.\n\n               Bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but \n               his overwhelming love for Natalie in his eyes. It's a two \n               way current.\n\n               This is their last moment together; everything that needs to \n               be said is being transmitted through a look. A look that \n               says: no regrets.\n\n<b>               INTERCUT WITH:\n</b>\n<b>               INT. SHELLY'S CADILLAC - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Nicky leans forward out of the shadows. Shelly holds his \n               gaze in the mirror. Nicky just shrugs.\n\n<b>                                     NICKY\n</b>                         The kid wants you should know, Shelly, \n                         he's just protecting our investment -- \n                         the old school way. See you around.\n\n               Shelly nods. He knows the score... A flash of steel appears \n               against his head. Muzzle strobe -- THUP! So long, Shelly \n               Kaplow.\n\n<b>               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The cop looms over Bernie and Natalie. Cocks his pistol.\n\n               Lowers the gun to the back of Bernie's head.\n\n               They appear oblivious to it. They're already in another place. \n               Sunning themselves in the Bahamas.\n\n               The cop squeezes back the trigger.\n\n<b>               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE\n</b>\n               still looking at each other. Suddenly the piercing shriek of\n\n               SCREECHING TIRES... followed by a reverberating, bone \n               crunching --\n\n               WHAM! -- and a GUNSHOT.\n\n               Bernie and Natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not \n               quite sure what's just transpired. Only that they're still \n               breathing. They look around, startled to see the tail lights \n               of a PICK-UP TRUCK about ten yards away. The cop, their would-\n               be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels.\n\n               All this in the blink of an eye.\n\n               Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Suppresses a hysterical, shock-\n               induced giggle. Bernie just looks dumbfounded. He staggers \n               to his feet, rushes over to the pick-up truck. The driver's \n               head is protruding through the shattered windshield.\n\n               Death-glazed eyes.\n\n               Bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure. Shakes his \n               head. We see a dozen Coors empties on the seat and floor of \n               the truck.\n\n               Natalie checks the cop. Likewise. Bernie comes over. They \n               regard each other breathlessly.\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         He was drunk.

It \n                         scares me. All I know is, you're \n                         still running hot and that's a good \n                         thing. But we're only winners if we \n                         keep going. No looking back.\n\n<b>                                     BERNIE\n</b>                         Lady luck, Natalie.

Bernie, eyes fixed on the road ahead, with the \n               contented smile of a man who has gambled on love -- and won.\n\n               His prize, resting her head against his shoulder.\n\n               The money, well, that ain't half bad as well.
