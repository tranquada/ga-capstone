CAMERA \n               PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and \n               hearing.\n\n               DISSOLVE OUT.\n\n               DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and \n               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business \n               jumble.\n\n               CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the \n               steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it \n               passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.\n\n               THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement \n               across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA \n               now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. \n               Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE \n               PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.\n\n               At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who \n               emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish \n               who she is.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear \n               her saying to Senf:\n\n                                     SUZETTE\n                         Madam Grusinskaya will not want her \n                         car.\n\n               This line is only just above the general clatter of action \n               but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- \n               and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going \n               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, \n               saying:\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.\n\n               The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a \n               section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in \n               profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of \n               people drinking before their lunch.\n\n               We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, \n               looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, \n               is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at \n               the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his \n               face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to \n               her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a \n               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at \n               his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA \n               and he moves out towards the lobby.\n\n               BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the \n               main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of \n               waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A \n               string orchestra is playing.\n\n               Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous \n               Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important \n               to a table.\n\n               THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just \n               as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel \n               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:\n\n                                     MAITRE D'HOTEL\n                         Where is that gentleman's soup?\n\n               The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to \n               argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to \n               another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:\n\n                                     WAITER\n                         Where's that soup?\n\n               Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, \n               into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's \n               counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that \n               moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket \n               forward.\n\n                                     BOY\n                         Quick -- come on -- come on...\n\n               The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception \n               of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: \"I'll \n               slap you on the mouth.\" At the same time he is pulling over \n               a cauldron of soup.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small \n               cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and \n               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- \n               She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has \n               filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down \n               the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.\n\n               THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. \n               Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette \n               carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A \n               horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, \n               he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to \n               tear the place down.\n\n                                     WAITER\n                              (anxious voice)\n                         Yes.\n\n                                     PREYSING\n                              (grimly)\n                         Cold.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                              (near Preysing's elbow)\n                         Mr. Preysing...\n\n                                     PREYSING\n                              (in same voice)\n                         Yes...\n\n                                     BELLBOY\n                         Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --\n\n               Preysing rises, struts from restaurant. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM -- \n               He walks out through the door...\n\n                                                     DISSOLVE OUT AND INTO:\n\n               Between two operators heads. Odd effect at board. CAMERA \n               TILTS UP as Preysing's head looks right down at girl.\n\n               Bellboy is with Preysing.\n\n                                     BELLBOY\n                         Mr. Preysing from Fredersdorf -- his \n                         call.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         Yes, Mr. Preysing --\n\n               Preysing begins drumming his fingers on the top of \n               switchboard.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                              (nervously)\n                         They've gone -- Just a moment, sir...\n\n                                     PREYSING\n                              (to boy)\n                         You told me it was on -- you said \n                         the call was through.\n                              (he waits irritably)\n\n                                     SECOND GIRL\n                              (to first)\n                         Who's in number three?\n\n                                     FIRST GIRL\n                         Senf -- the hall porter.\n                              (Girl looks off at...)\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               SENF IN TELEPHONE BOOTH\n\n                                     SENF\n                         Yes, it's Senf, the head porter, \n                         Grand Hotel... Are you at the \n                         Clinic?,... How's my wife?,... Is \n                         she in pain?,... Isn't the child \n                         coming soon?,... Patience! It's easy \n                         for you to talk... Get away?,... No, \n                         I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's \n                         like being in jail. Oh, I hope the \n                         child comes along all right.\n\n               At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT \n               BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from \n               desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:\n\n                                     PREYSING\n                         Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off \n                         the wire... No...

Yes, is your \n                         father there?... Hello, father?... \n                         Our stock has gone down twenty-three \n                         points.

Yes, \n                         I'm still speaking...\n\n               THE CAMERA THEN PANS TO Suzette. Suzette is already in the \n               booth and she is waiting for Mr. Meierheim to come on.\n\n                                     SUZETTE\n                              (starting to speak)\n                         Hello, Mr. Meierheim?...

Madam Grusinskaya will not go \n                         to the rehearsal... No... Madam is \n                         in a terrible state, she didn't sleep \n                         all night -- She's very tired... No, \n                         I'm speaking from a booth -- I didn't \n                         want to speak in front of her... I \n                         gave her a tablet of veronal...

That's what's \n                         the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on \n                         the line? No, it isn't nice to be \n                         told a thing like that. All sorts of \n                         things run through your head. I am \n                         going to stay here in Berlin. I am \n                         never coming back to Fredersdorf. \n                         Never! I want to get something out \n                         of life, too. You plague, and bother, \n                         and save -- and all of a sudden you \n                         are dead. Heinrich... You don't say \n                         anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, \n                         do you understand, the most expensive \n                         hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a \n                         room here. The very best people stay \n                         here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I \n                         saw him -- not five minutes after I \n                         was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell \n                         him exactly what I think of him. \n                         Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all \n                         my savings; my life insurance, too; \n                         I cashed in all my policies, the \n                         sick benefit fund, the old age \n                         pension, the unemployment insurance, \n                         the burial fund and everything... \n                         What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. \n                         I have to hang up now. I have to pay \n                         three times overcharge. Just think, \n                         Heinrich! There's music here all day \n                         long. And in the evening, they go \n                         around in full dress... Yes, sometimes \n                         I have pain, but I can stand it. \n                         Everything is frightfully expensive \n                         here. You can imagine, the Grand \n                         Hotel... What? Time's up...\n\n               Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor \n               approaching through Kringelein's booth.

The reason for the blackness is that \n               Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind \n               his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an \n               odd effect.

He looks for skeleton key and then remembers \n               refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd \n               way.\n\n               As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off \n               of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the \n               operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's \n               room.\n\n               He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger \n               prints off with his handkerchief.\n\n               He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring \n               suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want \n               to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. \n               Crosses to the door again.\n\n               Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's \n               voice singing an absurd song.\n\n               He listens. She is coming in.\n\n               The key turns in the door.\n\n               Quickly he hides behind the curtains.\n\n               Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, \n               enters the room.\n\n               He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. \n               After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. \n               We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.\n\n               The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear \n               from Preysing's radio.\n\n               The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer \n               it but continues her duties.\n\n               At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it \n               up and speaks.\n\n                                     CHAMBERMAID\n                         No -- no -- there is no one here.\n                              (she replaces the \n                              receiver)\n\n               At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears \n               at the open door.\n\n                                     INSPECTRESS\n                              (to Chambermaid)\n                         You're late...

She is looking \n               at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking \n               for dust.

Business ad lib.\n\n               Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the \n               telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                              (into telephone)\n                         Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, \n                         I haven't found her. Is Desprez \n                         dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all \n                         right. Keep the show going.\n                              (bangs down receiver)\n                         Wait till I see her, she'll pay for \n                         this -- this little trick is going \n                         to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach \n                         of contract.\n\n                                     SUZETTE\n                         Madame is ill -- her nerves...\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                         Her nerves... What about my nerves?... \n                         Who is she anyway? Where does she \n                         think she is -- Russia? Those days \n                         have passed.\n\n               He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is \n               in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one \n               shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into \n               the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, \n               make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.\n\n                                     SUZETTE\n                         Madame --\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                         Well?\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         I want to be alone.\n\n               The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to \n               pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                         Where have you been?\n\n                                     SUZETTE\n                         Should I -- Does madame wish...\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Suzette, please go, I want to be \n                         alone.\n\n               Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, \n               waiting for Meierheim.\n\n               Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                         I suppose I can cancel the Vienna \n                         engagement.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         I wish to be alone.\n\n                                     MEIERHEIM\n                         You'll be very much alone, my dear \n                         madame. This is the end.\n                              (he stamps out)\n\n               Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it \n               on Meierheim's exit.\n\n               DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.\n\n               It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to \n               door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and \n               throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses \n               slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the \n               strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.\n\n               Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.\n\n               FLASH OF BARON\n\n               Watching her.\n\n               GRUSINSKAYA\n\n               Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. \n               Then she becomes weary again.\n\n               With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the \n               curtain -- where the Baron is standing.\n\n               BARON\n\n               We see him tense himself.\n\n               GRUSINSKAYA\n\n               She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out \n               of scene.\n\n               CLOSEUP OF BARON\n\n               He peeps around the curtains.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               GRUSINSKAYA\n\n               She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks \n               steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her \n               hands and we hear her say:\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         The end -- over -- finished --\n\n               Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.\n\n               Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across \n               the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and \n               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.\n\n               She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, \n               places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are \n               quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- \n               asks for the theatre.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         The Western Theatre --\n\n               She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- \n               stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to \n               telephone speaks:\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Western Theatre?\n\n               She glances up at the clock.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet \n                         master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- \n                         hurry.\n\n               Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she \n               commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. \n               Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.\n\n               She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into \n               the telephone --\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. \n                         I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... \n                         No, no don't --\n                              (long pause)\n                         ...Just alone... Good night, good \n                         night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, \n                         how is it going, badly?... Uh?... \n                         Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- \n                         and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- \n                         they didn't miss me?... They didn't \n                         miss me.\n                              (she lets her hand \n                              drop with the receiver \n                              and goes on talking \n                              into the air)\n                         They didn't miss me -- good night, \n                         Pimenov...\n\n               She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in \n               her hand, unreplaced.\n\n               The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind \n               her the Baron peers from the closet.\n\n               Her head sinks down upon her hands.\n\n               A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts \n               the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice \n               of Opehlia, she speaks:\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                              (with great humility)\n                         Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have \n                         finished.\n                              (she replaces the \n                              receiver)\n\n               The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It \n               is in fact, ballet.\n\n               Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. \n               She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the \n               table, or hangs it over the telephone.\n\n               She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the \n               Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.\n\n               We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. \n               \"No, there is not time.\" She is returning calmly. She crosses \n               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. \n               She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. \n               She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.\n\n               She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded \n               hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.\n\n               The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he \n               looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for \n               the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his \n               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.\n\n               It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.\n\n               At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his \n               hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her \n               bed.\n\n               She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer \n               who has heard something, then reassured. She places the \n               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is \n               quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her \n               head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal \n               and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away \n               upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance \n               herself.\n\n               The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to \n               the bedside noiselessly and stands there.\n\n               She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the \n               glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.\n\n               She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the \n               floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal \n               falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a \n               sitting position.\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.\n\n               She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be \n               coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the \n               bed.\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Careful -- there's broken glass on \n                         the floor.\n\n               Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her \n               kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse \n               of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she \n               is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be \n               a silly movement.\n\n                                     BARON\n                         There.\n                              (takes a pillow from \n                              the bed throws it \n                              upon the floor over \n                              the glass, steps \n                              back)\n\n               She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which \n               was lying across the back of a chair.\n\n               Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She \n               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron \n               puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, \"What is this?\" She glances \n               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this \n               man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense \n               of relief with her. She is trembling.\n\n               The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his \n               danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand \n               marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she \n               will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He \n               could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or \n               silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating \n               sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Please do not be frightened, Madam.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                              (after a silence)\n                         What do you want here?\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Nothing -- only to be here.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Why do you hide in my room?\n\n                                     BARON\n                         But surely you must know -- because \n                         I love you.\n\n                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n                         Because you love me -- you love me?\n\n               She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she \n               throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more \n               passionately.\n\n                                     BARON\n                              (going over to her)\n                         Poor little Grusinskaya!

THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is \n               characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A \n               distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for \n               the first time by alcohol.\n\n               Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon \n               his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.\n\n               THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because \n               the Doctor has paused at the door.\n\n                                     KRINGELEIN\n                         Oh, but Doctor.

He crosses to the \n               mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.\n\n               He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. \n               Imitating the doctor, he repeats:\n\n                                     KRINGELEIN\n                         Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- \n                         good night.\n\n               He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.\n\n               He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the \n               carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm \n               and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass \n               and some water which he sees standing on the night table by \n               his bed.\n\n               He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with \n               water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine \n               bottles.\n\n               His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.\n\n               He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- \n               his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.\n\n               He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops \n               into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden \n               impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine \n               away.\n\n               With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song \n               that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid \n               song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters \n               around the room, undressing.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n               DISSOLVE INTO PASSAGE\n\n               His voice is still heard in the passage.\n\n               Rows of shoes outside the doors.

He actually gets \n               under the card table.\n\n               The Doctor looks at the Baron.\n\n               The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.\n\n                                     KRINGELEIN\n                              (talking at intervals \n                              as he crawls looking \n                              for money)\n                         You don't know, because you've never \n                         lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and \n                         saved and scrimped. My life hangs \n                         upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives \n                         you anything. You have to buy \n                         everything and pay cash for it. I \n                         wanted to pay for my last days with \n                         that money.

He throws his cigarette away -- he bites \n               his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a \n               thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped \n               him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity \n               for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the \n               time the Doctor watches.\n\n               The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting \n               conscience.\n\n               Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during \n               rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but \n               piercing, says:\n\n                                     DOCTOR\n                         He must find his money, Baron.\n                              (next time)\n                         Mr. Kringelein should find his \n                         pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?\n\n               These are two interjections.\n\n               And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little \n               sack of pain, his head down.\n\n               The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking \n               for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and \n               turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his \n               voice as he says:\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Here -- here it is.

In front of him is the door of \n               the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In \n               his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience \n               feel his problem with him.\n\n               This man who has lived and whistled and love through the \n               play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron \n               has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his \n               hair back.\n\n               Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. \n               He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of \n               Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The \n               Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. \n               He walks down the corridor.\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Flaemmchen, what are you doing here \n                         in the middle of the night.\n\n                                     FLAEMMCHEN\n                         Looking for my room -- one sixty-\n                         six.\n\n                                     BARON\n                         You live here?\n\n                                     FLAEMMCHEN\n                         For tonight.\n                              (she points to door -- \n                              she looks at him a \n                              long time)\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Oh!\n\n                                     FLAEMMCHEN\n                         Yes -- oh!\n\n                                     BARON\n                         Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.\n\n                                     FLAEMMCHEN\n                         And Baron, thanks so much for \n                         everything.\n\n               They both go into their respective rooms.\n\n               Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh \n               Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of \n               funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about \n               themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically \n               for the want of a little money.\n\n               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM\n\n               Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp \n               burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining \n               door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts \n               down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his \n               door. She peeps through.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM\n\n               from her angle.\n\n               Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and \n               on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's \n               picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake \n               because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his \n               hand.\n\n               FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN\n\n               An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and \n               he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes \n               the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and \n               takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, \n               lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts \n               at the noise. \"Has it awakened him.\" She looks off.\n\n               SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR\n\n               The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the \n               adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room \n               the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he \n               is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks \n               hoarsely, quietly.\n\n                                     PREYSING\n                         Flaemmchen!\n                              (he seizes her to him)\n\n               She goes to his arms passively.

He is puzzled. \n               Shadow crosses again. \"Who can be in his room?\" He moves \n               forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French \n               window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively \n               searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar \n               is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. \n               He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face \n               watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, \n               pulling the window after him.

Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the \n               receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He \n               is terrified.\n\n               Door opens behind him.\n\n               Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, \n               crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing \n               seizes her.\n\n               Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we \n               think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She \n               is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can \n               hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the \n               traffic below.\n\n               Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, \n               it is the first time we have been conscious of it.\n\n               With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. \n               It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own \n               room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from \n               her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears \n               through her own room.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               CORRIDOR\n\n               Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. \n               After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running \n               across the ice in \"Way Down East,\" -- it is Flaemmchen, a \n               Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. \"What \n               the hell is this -- what is it.\" The impulse naturally is to \n               scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks \n               around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She \n               will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. \n               Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               KRINGELEIN'S ROOM\n\n               It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. \n               The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor \n               had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers \n               and shirt.\n\n               Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes \n               hanging to her, crosses.\n\n                                     FLAEMMCHEN\n                              (hoarse whisper)\n                         Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- \n                         where are you?\n\n               She sweeps to bed.

A policeman rides with the driver on the box.\n\n               By this time the man with the bread is counting: \n\n                                     BAKER\n                         One hundred and eight -- one hundred \n                         and ten -- one hundred and twelve...\n\n               Stay with him for a moment.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n               DISSOLVE INTO - EXTERIOR FRONT OF HOTEL\n\n               Shooting onto door - day lighting.\n\n               A man comes out and signals a black closed limousine, which \n               pulls forward.\n\n                                                              DISSOLVE OUT:\n\n               DISSOLVE INTO - MAIN HOTEL LOBBY\n\n               Early morning. Sense of chill and desolation. Some chairs \n               stand on tables. A vacuum cleaner is at work on the carpets. \n               Newspaper boys are delivering papers at the news stand. The \n               various shops are slowly being opened, the windows being \n               cleaned.\n\n               The general feeling of the beginning of another day.\n\n               THE CAMERA waits at a distance shooting from door as Preysing, \n               with a plain clothes man on either side of him, leaves, moving \n               towards THE CAMERA. He is grim, his hat is drawn over his \n               eyes. His hands deep in his pockets.

They talk eagerly out of earshot. \n               But it is apparent that Meierheim is, as usual, in a hurry.\n\n               Rohna is there too. One of the men carries a telephone stand, \n               wrapped loosely in paper.
