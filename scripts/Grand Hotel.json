CAMERA \n               PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and \n               hearing.\n\n<b>               DISSOLVE OUT.\n</b>\n               DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and \n               then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business \n               jumble.\n\n               CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the \n               steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it \n               passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.\n\n               THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement \n               across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA \n               now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. \n               Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE \n               PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.\n\n               At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who \n               emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish \n               who she is.\n\n               THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear \n               her saying to Senf:\n\n<b>                                     SUZETTE\n</b>                         Madam Grusinskaya will not want her \n                         car.\n\n               This line is only just above the general clatter of action \n               but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- \n               and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going \n               towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, \n               saying:\n\n<b>                                     VOICE\n</b>                         Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.\n\n               The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a \n               section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in \n               profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of \n               people drinking before their lunch.\n\n               We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, \n               looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, \n               is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at \n               the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his \n               face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to \n               her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a \n               chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at \n               his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA \n               and he moves out towards the lobby.\n\n               BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the \n               main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of \n               waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A \n               string orchestra is playing.\n\n               Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous \n               Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important \n               to a table.\n\n               THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just \n               as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel \n               now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:\n\n<b>                                     MAITRE D'HOTEL\n</b>                         Where is that gentleman's soup?\n\n               The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to \n               argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to \n               another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:\n\n<b>                                     WAITER\n</b>                         Where's that soup?\n\n               Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, \n               into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's \n               counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that \n               moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket \n               forward.\n\n<b>                                     BOY\n</b>                         Quick -- come on -- come on...\n\n               The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception \n               of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: \"I'll \n               slap you on the mouth.\" At the same time he is pulling over \n               a cauldron of soup.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n               CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small \n               cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and \n               hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- \n               She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has \n               filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down \n               the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.\n\n               THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. \n               Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette \n               carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A \n               horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, \n               he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to \n               tear the place down.\n\n<b>                                     WAITER\n</b>                              (anxious voice)\n                         Yes.\n\n<b>                                     PREYSING\n</b>                              (grimly)\n                         Cold.\n\n<b>                                     VOICE\n</b>                              (near Preysing's elbow)\n                         Mr. Preysing...\n\n<b>                                     PREYSING\n</b>                              (in same voice)\n                         Yes...\n\n<b>                                     BELLBOY\n</b>                         Telephone -- from Fredersdorf --\n\n               Preysing rises, struts from restaurant.

Hello! \n                         Listen! You know that will I made \n                         before my operation? I gave it to \n                         you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy \n                         it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin \n                         to see a great specialist about that \n                         old trouble of mine... It's pretty \n                         bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I \n                         can't live much longer.\n                              (louder)\n                         I haven't long to live! That's what's \n                         the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on \n                         the line? No, it isn't nice to be \n                         told a thing like that. All sorts of \n                         things run through your head. I am \n                         going to stay here in Berlin. I am \n                         never coming back to Fredersdorf. \n                         Never! I want to get something out \n                         of life, too. You plague, and bother, \n                         and save -- and all of a sudden you \n                         are dead. Heinrich... You don't say \n                         anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, \n                         do you understand, the most expensive \n                         hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a \n                         room here. The very best people stay \n                         here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I \n                         saw him -- not five minutes after I \n                         was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell \n                         him exactly what I think of him. \n                         Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all \n                         my savings; my life insurance, too; \n                         I cashed in all my policies, the \n                         sick benefit fund, the old age \n                         pension, the unemployment insurance, \n                         the burial fund and everything... \n                         What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. \n                         I have to hang up now. I have to pay \n                         three times overcharge. Just think, \n                         Heinrich! There's music here all day \n                         long. And in the evening, they go \n                         around in full dress... Yes, sometimes \n                         I have pain, but I can stand it. \n                         Everything is frightfully expensive \n                         here. You can imagine, the Grand \n                         Hotel... What? Time's up...\n\n               Near the conclusion of Kringelein's speech, we see the Doctor \n               approaching through Kringelein's booth.

Her coat, over one \n               shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into \n               the center of the room.

She crosses to \n               door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and \n               throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses \n               slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the \n               strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.\n\n               Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.\n\n<b>               FLASH OF BARON\n</b>\n               Watching her.\n\n<b>               GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>\n               Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. \n               Then she becomes weary again.\n\n               With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the \n               curtain -- where the Baron is standing.\n\n<b>               BARON\n</b>\n               We see him tense himself.\n\n<b>               GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>\n               She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out \n               of scene.\n\n<b>               CLOSEUP OF BARON\n</b>\n               He peeps around the curtains.\n\n<b>                                                                    CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>               GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>\n               She is in a thin robe.

Goes to bathroom.\n\n               Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across \n               the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and \n               darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.\n\n               She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, \n               places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are \n               quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- \n               asks for the theatre.\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                         The Western Theatre --\n\n               She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- \n               stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to \n               telephone speaks:\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                         Western Theatre?\n\n               She glances up at the clock.\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                         The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet \n                         master...

She writes frantically. \n               Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                         Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.\n\n               She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into \n               the telephone --\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                         Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. \n                         I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... \n                         No, no don't --\n                              (long pause)\n                         ...Just alone...

She sits with it in \n               her hand, unreplaced.\n\n               The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind \n               her the Baron peers from the closet.\n\n               Her head sinks down upon her hands.\n\n               A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts \n               the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice \n               of Opehlia, she speaks:\n\n<b>                                     GRUSINSKAYA\n</b>                              (with great humility)\n                         Oh -- I'm sorry, yes...

It \n               is in fact, ballet.\n\n               Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. \n               She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the \n               table, or hangs it over the telephone.\n\n               She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the \n               Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.\n\n               We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. \n               \"No, there is not time.\" She is returning calmly. She crosses \n               to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. \n               She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. \n               She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.\n\n               She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded \n               hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.\n\n               The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he \n               looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for \n               the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his \n               eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.\n\n               It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.\n\n               At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his \n               hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her \n               bed.\n\n               She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer \n               who has heard something, then reassured. She places the \n               veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is \n               quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her \n               head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal \n               and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away \n               upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance \n               herself.\n\n               The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to \n               the bedside noiselessly and stands there.\n\n               She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the \n               glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.\n\n               She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the \n               floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal \n               falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a \n               sitting position.\n\n<b>                                     BARON\n</b>                         Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.\n\n               She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be \n               coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the \n               bed.\n\n<b>                                     BARON\n</b>                         Careful -- there's broken glass on \n                         the floor.\n\n               Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her \n               kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse \n               of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she \n               is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be \n               a silly movement.\n\n<b>                                     BARON\n</b>                         There.\n                              (takes a pillow from \n                              the bed throws it \n                              upon the floor over \n                              the glass, steps \n                              back)\n\n               She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which \n               was lying across the back of a chair.\n\n               Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She \n               draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron \n               puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, \"What is this?\" She glances \n               back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this \n               man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense \n               of relief with her. She is trembling.\n\n               The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his \n               danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand \n               marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she \n               will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He \n               could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or \n               silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating \n               sense of romance and danger.

Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his \n               hands are limp.\n\n               By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course \n               know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from \n               Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.\n\n               We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see \n               his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his \n               inside pocket --\n\n               He stands looking down at Kringelein.\n\n<b>                                     DOCTOR\n</b>                              (drops Kringelein's \n                              hand)\n                         It will be over in a minute.\n\n               Kringelein's eyes flutter.

He throws his cigarette away -- he bites \n               his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a \n               thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped \n               him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity \n               for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the \n               time the Doctor watches.\n\n               The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting \n               conscience.\n\n               Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during \n               rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but \n               piercing, says:\n\n<b>                                     DOCTOR\n</b>                         He must find his money, Baron.\n                              (next time)\n                         Mr. Kringelein should find his \n                         pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?\n\n               These are two interjections.\n\n               And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little \n               sack of pain, his head down.\n\n               The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking \n               for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and \n               turn.

The figure of \n               Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand.

The gay, fresh \n               Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of \n               funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about \n               themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically \n               for the want of a little money.\n\n<b>               FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM\n</b>\n               Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp \n               burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining \n               door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts \n               down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his \n               door.

Opens her bag and takes out night dress, \n               lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly.

In this odd lighting he \n               is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward.
