Closed and slowly it opens up and looks\naround. Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor\nin a strange-looking room. 4 walls, 1 ceiling, 1 floor. 6 sides\njust like a cube. There is a kind of door on each side. Each\ndoor has a handle. On the walls are weird-looking pictures.\nThey doesn't seem to look like anything seen before. The man\nstands up in the middle of the room. The camera pans around him.\nThen he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls.\nAs he looks in to the open door, he sees a new room like the one\nhe is located in, but the light in the new room is blue. He\nturns around and the door closes by itself. Then he opens the\ndoor in in the floor. Under that door, there's a new room\nexcatly like the first, but in this room the light is red.\nThe door closes. He opens a new door in one of the walls.\nThe light in there is red. He looks back and then crawls into\nthe new room. As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes\na loud sound, and then the door closes behind him. He takes one\nstep, and then there is a loud sound. The man stands still.\nSlowly he begins to bleed, and slowly his body begins to fall\napart. As the last parts of his body hits the floor, we see\na sort of trelliswork. First it moves to the floor, and\nafterwards it is being folded up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nTITLE AND INTRO\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA man lies on the floor. A door is open beside him. Slowly\nwe see a hand trying to find something to hold on to. A man\ncrawls up from the hole.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHey...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin closes the door in the floor. He sits down beside the\nman lying on the floor and tries to wake him.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHey...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls. He\nlooks into a new room. Red light. He closes the door again.\nThe man from before is now awake. We hear a sound from one of\nthe other doors in the walls. Quentin stands beside the door\npreparing to attack whatever that comes out from there. As\nsomeone looks out, Quentin grabs her by the neck, throws her\nto the floor and tries to beat her, until he realises that\nit is a lady. The lady screams, and sits down in a corner\nof the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nI'm sorry... It's alright, I'm not gonna hurt you.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat do you want?\n\nQUENTIN\nI thought you were...\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat?\n\nQUENTIN\nI don't know...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around.\nAs the sound stops, someone screams for help. Quentin opens\na door real fast. As the camera switches to a new angle, we\nsee a girl in a red room screaming for help. When she sees\nQuentin she walks towards him.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nSTOP!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin crawls into the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWhat, what?\n\nQUENTIN\nIt's ok, come here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are\nlocated. Holloway helps Leaven out, but not good enough,\nbecause Leaven falls and drops her glasses. Leaven sits up\nagainst a wall and Quentin comes towards her.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nIt's ok, calm down, evrything's gonna be fine.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat was in there?\n\nQUENTIN\nJust give me a minute to figure things out.\n\nHOOLOWAY\nWhy are you afraid of that room?\n\nQUENTIN\nJust give me a minute I said.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe door in the ceiling is being opened. We see an old man.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHow many people are in this thing? Listen! We can't go\nclimbing around in here.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhy not?\n\nQUENTIN\nThere's traps.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat do you mean, traps?\n\nQUENTIN\nUbitraps. I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my \n\nhead off!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe old man crawls down to the others, while Quentin talks\nabout the traps. Leaven breathes heavily.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHoly God, holy, holy God!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe. Leaven\nsuddenly hugs Quentin. Holloway sits down beneath Worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nAre you alright? Mister? Worth?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway gets the attention from Worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nAlright?\n\nWORTH\nI hit my head?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nLet me take a look at that. It's ok, I'm a doctor, it doesn't\nlook bad.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe old man stands up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat the hell are you doing?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHey old man?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe old man, Rennes, throws his boot into the room. An\nincinerator quickly burns the boot. Rennes pulls the boot\nback and then the door closes. Rennes drops the boot on the\nfloor.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRENNES\nMotiondetectors integrated in the walls. Tough to spot.\n\nLEAVEN\nOh God, oh God, oh God.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes is on his way to open a new door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWait a second! Let's all just relax for a minute. Does anybody remember \n\nhow they got here?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong, nervebreaking silence.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nPerogies! I was eating dinner. Perogies, cheese and potato. I ran out of \n\nsour cream and then I went to the fridge and then I... I don't know...\n\nQUENTIN\nYou... Leaven?\n\nLEAVEN\nI... I just went to bed and then\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat about you?\n\nWORTH\nI just woke up here.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nMiddle of the night. It's like Chile. They always come in the\nmiddle of the night.\n\nLEAVEN\nWho?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOnly the government can build something this ugly.\n\nQUENTIN\nOh, it ain't government.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThen what is it.\n\nQUENTIN\nI don't know.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nAliens!\n\nQUENTIN\nPlease, we're spooked anough as it is. Let's rule out aliens from now on \n\nand concentrate on what we know.\n\nLEAVEN\nMy mom's gonna freak...\n\nQUENTIN\nRennes...\n\nLEAVEN\nJust won't be there...\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat do you think Rennes?\n\nRENNES\nWe don't solve the act, sitting still. I'm moving at this straight line, \n\ntill I get to the end.\n\nQUENTIN\nAlright, I attend to agree.\n\nLEAVEN\nShouldn't we wait here? To see if anybody comes.\n\nWORTH\nNo one is gonna come.\n\nQUENTIN\nThere's a way in here, so there's gotta be a way out. We can avoid the \n\ntraps using the boot. Holloway is it. What do you think? For an exit?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOk.\n\nQUENTIN\nIt can't be that simple.\n\nRENNES\nIt ain't gonna be that simple. Take a look around. Take a\ngood long look around, see it. Coz, I got a feeling it's\nlooking at us.\n\nLEAVEN\nI just wanna wake up...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven blinks with her eyes several times. Quentin sits down\nbeneath her.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven, we can do this. We just have to stay calm, and work\ntogether as a team. There's gotta be a lot of people\nlooking for us on the outside. I'm a cop, alright?\n\nLEAVEN\nYou're a cop?\n\nQUENTIN\nYeah... I'm gonna get you out of here, I promise, but you\ngotta be with me on this one...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven nods.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nOk.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes opens a new door, waiting for Quentin to give \"signal\"\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nBoot it!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes throws the boot, nothing happens.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRENNES\nClean.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThrough several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms, with\nother colors on the walls. On the way to a new green room,\nLeaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms. A\nloud sound is to hear.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThat one sounded closer.\n\nRENNES\nIt's mechanical. Seems to come at regular intervals.\n\nQUENTIN\nMaybe it's the ventilationsystem?\n\nRENNES\nNo bets...\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNo kidding, I'm boiling\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven looks at the numbers again: 566 472 737. Above these\nnumbers are some others: 476 804 539.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat is it, serial numbers?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nRoom numbers, they're different in each room.\n\nWORTH\nOh great, so there's only 566 million 400.000 rooms in this thing.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThere'd better not be! We have about three days without food and\nwater before we're too weak to move.\n\nLEAVEN\nThey have to feed us, don't they?\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOh, we have heat, stress, physical exhaustion i.e. dehydration,\nheadaches, dizziness, disorientation, confusement. Mental process.\nThe body eventual begins to break down it's own tissue.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes rips a button of Holloway's shirt.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRENNES\nSuck on it... Keeps the saliva flowing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgain the boot lands in a new room. This time, it's red.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat?\n\nRENNES\nThe air seems dry in there.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nTrapped?\n\nRENNES\nMolecular chemical sensor.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhy the hell didn't the boot set it off.\n\nRENNES\nThe boot's not alive. It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from\nthe skin.\n\nQUENTIN\nHow come, you know so much about sensors, Renz?\n\nRENNES\nRennes... Not Renz! It's french!\n\nQUENTIN\nFine, you're french. I'm asking how...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes opens a new door and throws the boot.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nRennes... Sensorexpert... With the right age... I don't believe\nit...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin laughs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nThis guy is The Wren...\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThe what?\n\nQUENTIN\nThe Wren. The bird of Attica. through the coop on six major\nprisons.\n\nRENNES\nSeven!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nYou're kidding right?\n\nLEAVEN\nYou can get us out?\n\nRENNES\nMaybe.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nAn escapeartist!\n\nRENNES\nYes, I'm Harry \"fucking\" Houdini. The only reason I dragged you\nso far, is cause I need your boots. If you're not smarting up\nI'm gone like that. No more talking... No more guessing. Don't\neven think about something which is not right in front of ya.\nThat's the real challenge, you gotta save yourselves from\nyourselves.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes jumps into the new room. We hear a click.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRENNES\nMerde.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes gets acid in the face. He screams, and the door closes.\nIn the other room, the door begins to open.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nGet him out!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRennes' head is partly dissolved. He screams quietly, because\nhe has blood in his mouth. The others scream too. They lay him\nin a corner. After a little while they look to him again.\nHe's dead, most of his head his been dissolved.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nSo it was electrochemical or whatever, right? And he missed it.\nThe Wren... That's great, that's fucking great.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nAlright... It's time to reassess this place.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI've been over it again and again, why would they throw\ninnocent people in here? Are we being punished?\n\nLEAVEN\nI've never done anything to deserve this!\n\nQUENTIN\nForget about all that! You can't see the big picture from in\nhere. So don't try. Keep your head down. Keep it simple.\nJust look, look at what's in front of you.\n\nWORTH\nThat's what he said.\n\nQUENTIN\nStart with us. We got an escapeartist and a cop.\nThere's gotta be a reason for that. You're a doctor Holloway.\nThat gives you a function, a reason, right?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNo, it just makes me go: \"Why me, and not one\nof the ten million other doctors out there\"!\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven. What are you?\n\nLEAVEN\nNothing, I jst go to school, hang out with my friends.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat else?\n\nLEAVEN\nThere is nothing else. My parents are these people\nI live with them... I'm boring.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI think we have to ask the big questions: What does it want? What is it \n\nthinking?\n\nWORTH\nOne down, four to go.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhy don't you tell us what your purpose is Worth!\n\nWORTH\nI've wondered that myself. I'm just a guy, I work in an\nofficebuilding, doing officebulding stuff. I wasn't\nactually bursting joie de vivre before I got here. Life\njust sucks in general.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI can't stand that attitude.\n\nLEAVEN\nBecause, he's right.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat\u00b4s your purpose Quentin?\n\nQUENTIN\nKids.. Three of them... I haven't made my piece yet.\nI'm getting out of here no matter what. That's where\nmy strength comes from. You people find yours wherever you\ngot it. For Christ's sake. What do you live for? Don't you\nhave a wife or a girlfriend or something?\n\nWORTH\nNope, I got a pretty nice collection of pornography\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNice, nice. I ain't got anyone either, but I'm not giving\nup. I'm pissed off. The came into our homes. They stripped\nus bare. They took my rings. They took my... my amethyst.\nI wanna know who's responsible.\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven, your glasses? You don't need them?\n\nLEAVEN\nOnly for reading.\n\nQUENTIN\nWell, they took off her jewelry, but they must have put\nthese on you. If nothing is random... why are they here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin opens a door in the wall. We see three numbers:\n582 434 865. On the other side there's the numbers: 149 413 568.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven, what do you read in school? Math?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat can they mean?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\n149?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven opens a new door. The numbers we see are: 645 372 xxx\n-649\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nPrimenumbers. I can't believe I didn't see it before.\n\nQUENTIN\nSee what?\n\nLEAVEN\nIt seems like if any of these numbers of prime, then the room is\ntrapped. Ok, 645... 645, that's not prime. 372... no. 649...\nWait, 11 x 59, it's not prime either. So that room is safe.\n\nQUENTIN\nWait, wait, wait. How can you make that decision based on one\nprimenumbertrap?\n\nLEAVEN\nI'm not. The incinerator thing was prime: 083. The\nmolecularchemical thing had 137, the acidroom had 149.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nYou'd remembered all that in your head?\n\nLEAVEN\nI have a facility for it.\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven, you beautiful brain... Boot it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway throws the boot. Nothing happens.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nOk, out of the way.\n\nLEAVEN\nBrains before beauty.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven jumps into the room............... Nothing happens......\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nSAFE! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers! Primenumbers!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe camera pans around for some time. First we see the numbers:\n656 778 462, then we see Leaven thinking.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nHow long have we been in here\n\nQUENTIN\nNine or ten hours.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe see a door closing. Then we see Leaven rubbing her eyes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHow do you know?\n\nQUENTIN\n5 'o clock stubble. the last thing I remember was shaving.\n\nLEAVEN\nI guess I missed breakfeast... or lunch... or whatever\n\nQUENTIN\nNow don't worry. I'll be home in time for dinner.\n\nLEAVEN\nIf we get out, I'l make you dinner.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou got a date.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin opens a door and Leaven looks at the numbers inside.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nDoing good.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI need to smoke! I could smoke a butt of a sidewalk.\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway... Just real yourself in a bit. Come on. Were moving\nalong, things are looking up.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOk. You're right, I quitted smoking years ago. I just need to\nbe occupied.\n\nQUENTIN\nTalk to me. Have a conversation. What kind of doctor are you\nanyway?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nUh, you know, the free kinda... Er, come on help me. Tell me\nabout your rugrats.\n\nQUENTIN\nOk. We have three boys. Nine, seven and five.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOh, good God. Poor woman. There's no way I'd survived that.\n\nQUENTIN\nShe didn't either................. She's not dead, we're just\nseparated.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI'm sorry, I can't just shoot the breeze.\n\nLEAVEN\nThese numbers aren't prime.\n\nQUENTIN\nOk. Clear.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nExcuse me, sorry.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou could try and help me out here buddy.\n\nWORTH\nNo, I couldn't\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe group crawls into the new room. Shortly afterwards they are\nin a green room, with everyone looking down in a new room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nThis one is trapped too.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin closes the door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWe have to backtrack?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin looks up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nNot yet.\n\nLEAVEN\nOh, no.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEveryone looks up on the door. the Quentin looks at Leaven.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nRead them to me.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin takes of his shirt. Leaven is ready to hold it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat are you? His coatrack? Oh please.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin begins to crawls up to the door. As he wants to open\nthe door, he says:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nIt's stuck!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs Quentin opens the door, a guy falls down and almost hits\nLeaven. Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nThis room is green.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nKazan begins to knock his head into the wall.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway now looks at Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHi there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway puts a hand on Kazan's forehead.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nThis room is green.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nYes it is.\n\nKAZAN\nI wanna go back to the blue room.\n\nQUENTIN\nIs it shock or what?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI think he's mentally handicapped.\n\nKAZAN\nI like the blue room.\n\nQUENTIN\nJesus Christ!\n\nLEAVEN\nHe almost broke my neck.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHey there, are you all alone? Do you wanna hold my hand, honey?\n\nKAZAN\nButter first, then honey, Kazan. Butter first then honey.\n\nLEAVEN\nHow did he survive?\n\nKAZAN\nI wanna go back to the blue room.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThere's lots of blue rooms. We'll find another one to you\nreal soon.\n\nLEAVEN\nThis is just way too bizarre.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWill you just worry about your own numbers...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven looks molested.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nGo on, I'll look after him.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven points at the ceiling.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nSafe, obviously. Since he almost fell on my head.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nShall we go for a walk? Kazan, do you wanna go for a walk?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs Quentin begins to crawl up to the door. Kazan gets\nterrified. He hits himself with the one hand on his head.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nErm' Quentin. Let's not make him do the climbing thing right away.\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway!\n\nKAZAN\nHolloway.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe screen fades and next time we see something is in a new\nroom where Kazan opens a new door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nCould they have taken us all the way to New Mexico?\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat are you talking about Holloway?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI'm talking about: \"Where do you hide something this big?\" It has at \n\nleast got to fill something.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway stands walks over to Quentin and stands beside him.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI'm sorry to shake your foundations Quentin, but you have no idea\nwhere your tax-dollars go.\n\nQUENTIN\nFree clinic doctors?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOnly the military industrial complex can afford to build something\nthis size.\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway, what's the military industrial complex? Have you ever been \n\nthere? I'm tellin' you, it's not that complex.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nAnd how would you know from where you are.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat do you think these establishments is? It's just guys like me. Their \n\ndesks are bigger, but their jobs aren't. They don't conspide, they... buy boats. No, \n\nthis place is... Remember Scaramanga? The bad guy in \"The Man With The Golden Gun\". \n\nIt's some rich psyco's entertainment.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nIs that what you think?\n\nLEAVEN\nClear!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway crawls into the passage.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOk, you're a cop. Single bullet theory. Right on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs Holloway lands in the new room, she starts to lose her\nbreath. It seems like she's being choken.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nGas!\n\nQUENTIN\nHolloway! Get back here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut Holloway stays where she is.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nIt's ok. I just swallowed my button.\n\nLEAVEN\nI hate this! I hate this!\n\nQUENTIN\nYour boy's having a conniption sitting there.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA door is being opened.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nIt's like cr\u00e8me without coffee.\n\nWORTH\nShe needs a break.\n\nQUENTIN\nShe can do it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair. And\nthen back to the other room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nThey don't look prime to me.\n\nQUENTIN\nIs that your two bits worth, Worth?\n\nWORTH\nOf course it's what is worth.\n\nQUENTIN\nWell?\n\nLEAVEN\nWell, he's right. Not prime.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin jumps into the new room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nSTOP! In front of you!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling\nand the slowly surrounds Quentin, rotates and Quentin\njust jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces.\nBut it wasn't without pain. Quentin gets cut on one of his legs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat is it?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin gets back into the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nSHUT UP!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe door closes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nI don't know what happened. it wasn't prime.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nQuentin, hold still!\n\nQUENTIN\nSomebody stop that rackets!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWorth.\n\nQUENTIN\nLeave the boots.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth joins Kazan to make him shut up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nAnd shut the fucking door!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe door closes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nI had a feeling about that fucking guy. He knew about that trap.\n\nLEAVEN\nBut these numbers aren't prime.\n\nQUENTIN\nThen your numbersystem failed, but he knew.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nKnew what? How could he know?\n\nQUENTIN\nYou're the paranoid, think about it. His only function so far is\nto kick us when we're down.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nSo, he has a bad attitude. So you think that makes him spy.\n\nQUENTIN\nTrust me on this, it's my job to read people like an x-ray.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan. Worth holds him\nfor his eyes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nHe doesn't like red rooms.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth makes Kazan, sit by himself.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nSo what happened?\n\nQUENTIN\nPmfh, you saw what happened!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nQuentin!\n\nLEAVEN\nI guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought.\n\nWORTH\nMaybe they mean nothing at all.\n\nLEAVEN\nNo, it means they're more involved, the works for us up to now have just \n\nbeen bad, I just need more time with them.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWe need to rest anyway.\n\nQUENTIN\nWell that's handy, like if there was nothing fucking else we could do.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe camera fades. Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nAre they telling you anything?\n\nLEAVEN\nThey're not Tarot-cards. Do you have any idea on how many variables I \n\nhave to consider before I can decide from numbers this size!?!? They don't reveal \n\nthemselves right away!\n\nQUENTIN\nThey're like people.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nKazan pulls down his pants to pee.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nOh, gross.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nErm, not here honey, over in the corner.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEverybody looks at him.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWell, he's just peeing!\n\nQUENTIN\nJesus Christ!\n\nLEAVEN\nExcellent! Now it totally reeks in here!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth laughs.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nAnd you find this all pretty funny, don't you?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin goes really close to Worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat's your fucking problem Worth? Even Holloway's holding up better than \n\nyou. Get over there and help her with him. That's your job, babysitter!\n\nWORTH\nJawohl, Kommandant!\n\nQUENTIN\nSomebody has to taka responsibility around here.\n\nWORTH\nAnd that somebody has to be you.\n\nQUENTIN\nNot all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists.\n\nWORTH\nNot all of us are conceded enough to play hero.\n\nQUENTIN\nIt's the will to live, everybody's got it Worth, even you, especially you \n\nhiding behind that cynical front.\n\nWORTH\nThe will to live. That's the warm, coasy feeling deep inside. Thanks \n\npartner, I'm a new man.\n\nQUENTIN\nArh, poor Worth: \"Nobody loves me\". If that's the chip on your shoulders, \n\nthen why did you lug it all this way? Why didn't you just lie down and die!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin opens the door to the trap from before.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nDo it. Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine. Be \n\na man.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nEverybody's waiting for Worth to answer. Finally Worth stands up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nThought so.\n\nWORTH\nFuck you Quentin. I don't wanna die, I'm just being realistic. Do you \n\nthink they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it?\n\nQUENTIN\nDo you think they would lay clues, if there wasn't a way out.\n\nWORTH\nYou think we matter, we don't\n\nQUENTIN\nPut us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here.\n\nWORTH\nOh, you're not getting out.\n\nQUENTIN\nYes, we are!\n\nWORTH\nThere is no way outta here!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLong and nervebreaking silence.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nGot ya.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHow... Do you know?\n\nQUENTIN\nAnswer the question Worth.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOh, God!\n\nQUENTIN\nWho are you?\n\nWORTH\nI am the poison. I designed the outer shell.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat?\n\nWORTH\nThe shell, the sarcophagus.\n\nLEAVEN\nYou builded this thing?\n\nWORTH\nNot this part, the exterior. I don't know anything about the numbers or \n\nanything else in here. I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell. A cube.\n\nLEAVEN\nA cube! Why didn't you tell us?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nFor Gods sake, Worth. You knew what it was.\n\nWORTH\nNo\n\nQUENTIN\nWorth! You're lying.\n\nWORTH\nNot first.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWho's beyond it?\n\nWORTH\nI don't know.\n\nQUENTIN\nWho hired you?\n\nWORTH\nI didn't ask. I never even left my office. I talked on the phone to some \n\nother guys like me. Specialists working on small details. Nobody knew what it was. \n\nNobody cared.\n\nQUENTIN\nBullshit! You knew from square one. Look at him, he's up to his eyeballs \n\nin this thing.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNo Quentin. That's how they stay hidden. You keep everyone separated so \n\nthe left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. The brain never comes out in \n\nthe open.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhose brain?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nIt's all the same machine right. Pentagon. Multinational coorporations. \n\nThe police! If you do one little job. You build a widget in Saskatoon. The next thing \n\nyou know, it's two miles under the desert, the essential component of a deathmachine. \n\nI was right! All along my whole life I knew it. I told you Quentin. Nobody's ever \n\ncall me paranoid again. We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing.\n\nWORTH\nHolloway, you don't get it.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThen tell me, please, I need to know.\n\nWORTH\nIt's maybe hard for you to understand, but there's no conspiracy. Nobody \n\nis in charge. It's a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan. \n\nCan you grasp that? Big brother is not watching you.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat kind of fucking explanation is that?\n\nWORTH\nIt's the best you\u00b4re gonna get. I looked and the only explanation I can \n\ncome to is that there is nobody up there.\n\nQUENTIN\nSomebody had to say yes to this thing.\n\nWORTH\nWhat thing? Only we know what it is.\n\nQUENTIN\nWe have no idea, what it is.\n\nWORTH\nWe know more than anybody else. I mean somebody might have known \n\nsometime, before they got fired or voted out or sold it. But if this place ever had a \n\npurpose, then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle. This is an accident, a \n\nforgotten propetual, public, worksproject. Do you think anybody wants to ask \n\nquestions? All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck. I mean, I lead on \n\nmy desk for months. This was a great job!\n\nQUENTIN\nWhy put people in it?\n\nWORTH\nBecause it's here. you have to use it or admit it's pointless.\n\nQUENTIN\nBut it is pointless!\n\nWORTH\nQuentin... That's my point.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat have we come to? It's so much worse than I thought.\n\nWORTH\nNot really, just more pathetic.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou make me sick, Worth!\n\nWORTH\nI make me sick too. We\u00b4re both part of the system. I drew a box - you \n\nwalk a beat. It's like you said Quentin is: Keep your head down, keep it simple, just \n\nlook at what's in fron of you! I mean nobody wants to see the big picture. Life's too \n\ncomplicated. I mean, let's face it. The reason we're here is it's out of control.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin turns around.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nIs that how we're ruining the world?\n\nLEAVEN\nDaah! Have you been on glue all of your life. I felt guilty for ruining \n\nthe world since I was like... seven. God! If you need someone to blame, throw a rock.\n\nWORTH\nNow I feel better.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThat's why you stayed with us. To confess.\n\nWORTH\nStill looking for someone to bust, Quentin?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin turns around again and begins to beat Worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nQuentin, Quentin, STOP IT!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven grabs Quentin's arm.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWe need him.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat for?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHave you gone absolutely mad? He's the only one who knows nything about \n\nthe place.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth falls to the ground. Quentin walks away.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWorth...\n\nWORTH\nHi...\n\nLEAVEN\nSo there's this outer shell.\n\nWORTH\nYeah.\n\nLEAVEN\nAnd it's a cube, like this?\n\nWORTH\nI assume so.\n\nLEAVEN\nAre there any doors?\n\nWORTH\nThere's one door.\n\nLEAVEN\nWhere?\n\nWORTH\nWherever the doorguy put it. Six guesses and it's sealed from the \n\noutside.\n\nLEAVEN\nWhat are the dimensions of the outer shell?\n\nWORTH\n434 feetsquare.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nMay I?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nCome on. Side over.\n\nLEAVEN\n14 by 14 by 14.\n\nWORTH\nThe inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell. There is a space.\n\nLEAVEN\nOne cube?\n\nWORTH\nI don't know. It makes sense.\n\nLEAVEN\nWell, the biggest the cube then can be is... 26 rooms heigh, 26 rooms \n\nacross, so... 17.576 rooms.\n\nHOLLOWAY\n17.576 rooms? Oh, God that makes me queasy.\n\nLEAVEN\nDescartes...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nLeaven, you are a genius!\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe see three numbers: 517 478 565\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nCartesian co-ordinates, of course, coded Cartesian co-ordinates. They are \n\nuses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph.\n\nQUENTIN\nIn English. Slower.\n\nLEAVEN\nBonjour, these numbers are markers, a grid-referance, like altitude and \n\nlongitude on a map. The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube.\n\nQUENTIN\nThen where are we?\n\nLEAVEN\nIt works! Ok, all I have to do now is add the numbers together. The X \n\nco-ordinate is 19, Y is 26 rooms. So that places us... seven rooms from the edge.\n\nQUENTIN\nAlright, let's go.\n\nWORTH\nJust out of curuiosity. I mean don't hit me again or anything. But what \n\nare you gonna do when you get there?\n\nQUENTIN\nMaybe we can get the door open.\n\nWORTH\nWrong.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps.\n\nQUENTIN\nI'm dealing with that Holloway. I'm looking for practical solutions here.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWell, you haven't found any yet!\n\nQUENTIN\nWe cut the risk with the numbers and the boot. Worth will go in first.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNo he won't Quentin, we take turns!\n\nQUENTIN\nRelax.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe camera fades. The first we see is someone nervous playing with his/hers button.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nIs there room for two in there?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin crawls in to Leaven.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQIENTIN\nWhat's the matter?\n\nLEAVEN\nThese co-ordinates: 14, 27, 14.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat about them?\n\nLEAVEN\nWell, they don't make sense. Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across, there \n\ncan't be a co-ordinate larger than 26. If that was right, then we would be outside \n\nthe cube.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven looks up, and looks around.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nNo, not outside the cube.\n\nQUENTIN\nI guess that means we're not having dinner.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe camera fades. First we see the group opening the door in the floor.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nTrap, trap, trap. TRAP!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe see a blue room. Just after Kazan says trap the last time. A lot of spears come \n\nout from the walls until the room is filled with spears. In the end the spears go \n\nback again.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nTRAP!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe spears come again, and goes away in the end.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\n(Whispers) It's soundactivated. BOOOH!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe spears come, and goes away. They close the door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nLovely.\n\nLEAVEN\nHow come the sound of the door-opening didn't set it off?\n\nQUENTIN\nMust be reat to ignore it.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nSo that's it. The edge is surrounded by traps.\n\nLEAVEN\nWell, I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else.\n\nQUENTIN\nWho knows how many detours we'll have to take. I say we cross the bitch.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nRight.\n\nQUENTIN\nHow many boots do we have left Holloway?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThey look at Kazan's feet. Just one boot left.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nGet it off him. We know how it works, we just have to be quiet.\n\nWORTH\nPretty fucking quiet.\n\nQUENTIN\nI'm glad you're on sight Worth, because you're up.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nKazan makes a sound.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nAnd he's not coming.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nOf course he is.\n\nQUENTIN\nNo way!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nYou're not leaving him behind.\n\nQUENTIN\nHe's unpredictable. When we get to the edge we can come back for him, but \n\nhe will get somebody killed here. Am I right?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nShame on you. Will you look at yourselves. What have you turned into? \n\nThey may have taken our lives away, but we're still human beings. That's all we've \n\ngot left.\n\nLEAVEN\nWe'll come back for him.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThat's a lie and you know it.\n\nWORTH\nHe'll be quiet.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin opens the door and puts Worth down there. He hangs in the ceiling by himself \n\nnow with a boot in his mouth. He crawls down the wall. Meanwhile we hear something \n\nnearby. As it's no longer is to hear. Worth opens a door, nothing happens, and crawls \n\nin. Leaven is up next. Afterwards Holloway. Next is Kazan. As Leaven is in Worth and \n\nHolloway stands on the floor. Kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls \n\nthe wrong way. Holloway goes to get him. Suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle \n\non the floor. Holloway tries to unloose it. Next up is Quentin. Now all is in except \n\nQuentin. He is on his way. In the floor the door is opening. So Quentin hurries up \n\nand aren't safe as the handle stops turning. He waits to be speared. Nothing happens.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n KAZAN\nHah!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow the spears come again, Quentin just makes it into the passage. Now we are in a \n\nred room. Quentin grabs Kazan and almost beats him.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nYou fucking fuck!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThat's enough!\n\nQUENTIN\nHe's a trap!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nLet him go right now!\n\nQUENTIN\nLaw of the jungle Holloway. He's a danger in the pack!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nLet him go you nazi!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin lets go of Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat did you call me?\n\nHOLLOWAY\nQuentin! You let that innocent boy go.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou listen to me woman. Every day I mop up after your bleeding heart. The \n\nonly reason why you exist is because I keep you! I know your type. No kids, no man to \n\nfuck you. So you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes, \n\nsniffing their business! You missed your boat Holloway. You are all dry up inside \n\nthere aren't you? That's your fucking problem.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe others look shocked.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nHow dare you say that to her? You don't know her Quentin. None ouf us \n\nknow eachother here.\n\nQUENTIN\nOh, I do.\n\nLEAVEN\nNo you don't!\n\nHOLLOWAY\nNo wonder your wife left you. All that bottled-up anger. And a thing for \n\nyoung girls.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin slaps Holloway in the face. He looks insulted.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nGod help you Quentin. Did you smack your kids around too?\n\nLEAVEN\nIs anybody besides me interested in what's on the other side of that \n\ndoor?\n\nQUENTIN\nOpen it.\n\nWORTH\nDoor number six, not door number one, door number two.\n\nQUENTIN\nOpen the fucking thing.\n\nHOLLOWAY\n(\"singing\") Sunshine.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth opens the door. Now we see something completely black. Only with a little light \n\nfrom rooms below and on the other sides. It's the edge, the shell.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nNighttime.\n\nWORTH\nMy old friend the shell.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth crawls into the passage.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nIt's there. Morning!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow we hear a gigantic echo.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHang on to me.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin crawls in and Worth crawls into the room again.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nCan't see shit. Nothing to hang on to.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin crawls back.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWe have to try something. We gotta see if the door's over there. Someone \n\nhas to swing over there and take a look. We make a rope of our clothes. Take it off. \n\nI'll tie it onto myself.\n\nLEAVEN\nYeah, you're gonna go. You weigh like 500 pounds it'll snap in two \n\nseconds. I'm the lightest.\n\nQUENTIN\nForget it.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nI'll go.\n\nQUENTIN\nI'm going Holloway.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nShe's right Quentin, you're too heavy. I'm the lightest after Leaven. \n\nAnyways it's my turn.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs Quentin ties the clothes, Holloway and Worth talks together.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHow long did you know people we're put in here.\n\nWORTH\nA couple of months.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThat's not long , if you consider your whole life.\n\nWORTH\nI am.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nYou opened my eyes Worth, that\u00b4s something.\n\nWORTH\nDavid.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nHelen.\n\nWORTH\nAnd such a Helen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway begins to crawl outside the room. She's almost crying.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nThat's as far as you go.\n\nHOLLOWAY\nThere's nothing down here. Hold tight. I'll try swinging over there. \n\nPlace yourself I'm gonna try again. Ok, one more time.\n\nWORTH\nHurry, you're getting heavy.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThird time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell there's a big crash. The others \n\nnow drops the grip of the rope. Quentin just reaches the end of the rope, as Holloway \n\nis falling. The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLLOWAY\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nQUENTIN\nGet up here now!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nHolloway crawls up. In the end Quentin can reach her arm. First Quentin smiles, \n\nHolloway smiles too. But then Quentin looks someway different. Holloway knows what is \n\ngoing to happen.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nQuentin...\n\nLEAVEN\nDo you got her?\n\nWORTH\nWhat's going on?\n\nLEAVEN\nIs she Ok?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin drops Holloway and crawls back into the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nShe... slipped.\n\nKAZAN\nHolloway.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven sits down i a corner. Quentin walks over to her.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nSssh! Come on Kazan. Kazan will you please stop doing that!\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven, you gotta be strong sweetheart.\n\nLEAVEN\nDon't even talk to me.\n\nQUENTIN\nWe gotta get down to the bottom. It'll be easier to get on to shell from \n\nthere. It's a long fucking way with only one boot. But we gotta do it, before we get \n\ntoo weak. You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven.\n\nLEAVEN\nI can't think anymore.\n\nQUENTIN\nSure you can. It's your gift.\n\nLEAVEN\nIt's not a gift, it's just a brain.\n\nWORTH\nLet her sleep for a while. We haven't slept for fucking hours.\n\nQUENTIN\nOk, one hour.\n\nWORTH\nHow the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is?\n\nQUENTIN\nAn hour is as long as I say.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe group go to sleep. In the background weird music is to hear. After a little \n\nwhile, we see someone taking the boot away from Worth. Then we see a hand holding \n\nLeaven for the mouth. Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and afterwards we see \n\nhim carry Leaven. The next we see is a door closing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWhat are you doing?\n\nQUENTIN\nWe have to make it down to the bottom. There'll be quiet there and you \n\ncan concentrate.\n\nLEAVEN\nDo you just wanna leave them?\n\nQUENTIN\nThey're traps! We are the key. I get us down there. You think us out. \n\nBelieve in me. Try to see what I see, how my mind works. THRASH! When I look into \n\nsomeone's head like a fucking x-ray. I looked through the walls. I dreamed him at his \n\ndesk, designing everything. He can't let you solve the puzzle. There is a purpose. We \n\nare the purpose. The cube is us.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin begins to touch Leaven.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nQuentin...\n\nQUENTIN\nWe fit like numbers. A man and a woman. Two halves of the equation. I \n\ntake you down. The perfect key.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nI'll slip you on the lock.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven runs away. Quentin stands up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven... It's time to go down.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin tries to catch her. Meanwhile a door is being opened. Worth comes jumping \n\nhitting Quentin to the floor. Kazan enters the room too. The door closes.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nGet away from her. Leaven, they're fucking spy's. Him, the retard. \n\nHolloway had outside information about my family. She went too far.\n\nLEAVEN\nYou dropped her.\n\nWORTH\nJust go Quentin\n\nLEAVEN\nGive us the boot, you pig!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot. Then he walks towards \n\nLeaven.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nYou don't want the boot.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThen Quentin again hits Worth several times. Afterwards he opens the door in the \n\nfloor.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nYou wanna come with us Worth? Down the hatch.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor. As Worth hits the floor, he starts \n\nlaughing.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat the fuck's with him?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe others crawl down to Worth. He lies on the door, on the handle. As the camera \n\nswitches angle, we see a corpse with the face down. Quentin turns the corpse with his \n\nfoot. It's Rennes. Quentin drops the boot.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nHow does he...?\n\nWORTH\n(laughing) It's The Wren, the old Renster.\n\nQUENTIN\nHow could...?\n\nWORTH\n(laughing) We've been going in circles\n\nQUENTIN\nThat can't be.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin grabs Leaven and opens a door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhere are we?\n\nLEAVEN\nI don't know.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhere are we???\n\nLEAVEN\nYou figure it out! You haven't done anything. All you do is freak out! \n\nYOU MURDERER!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven starts crying. Worth stands up and laughs. Quentin sits down.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nYou were right Worth. There is no outta here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin starts crying. Kazan comes and touches his hair.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\n(crying) Get away from me.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth stands up.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nWasn't Rennes killed in that room?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth opens the door to were Rennes was killed. There's nothing. All we see is black. \n\nIt's the edge, the shell.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nHow come there's nothing out there.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou see an edge.\n\nWORTH\nWe were not at the edge before. Where's the room that killed Rennes?\n\nQUENTIN\nFuck off!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin throws the boot after Worth, but the boot does not him it's being thrown out \n\nof the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nOh, that was good.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat difference does it make? We're dead anyways.\n\nWORTH\nHEY! Listen to what I'm saying! There was a room there before! We haven't \n\nbeen moving in circles, the rooms have!\n\nLEAVEN\nOf course.\n\nQUENTIN\nThe rooms?\n\nWORTH\nThat explains the thunder, the shaking. We've been shifting the whole \n\ntime.\n\nLEAVEN\nIt's the only logical explanation. I'm such an idiot.\n\nWORTH\nWhat are you on to Leaven.\n\nLEAVEN\nGive me a minute. The numbers are markers point on a map, right?\n\nWORTH\nRight.\n\nLEAVEN\nAnd how do you map a point that keeps moving?\n\nWORTH\nPermutations.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven nods.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nPermu... what?\n\nLEAVEN\nPermutations. A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through. \n\nLike a map that that tells you where the room starts, how many times it moves and \n\nwhere it moves to.\n\nQUENTIN\nThe numbers tell you all that?\n\nLEAVEN\nI don't know. I've only been looking at one point on the map, which is \n\nprobably the startingposition. All I saw, was how the cube looked like before it \n\nstarted to move.\n\nQUENTIN\nOk, so it's moving. How do we get out?\n\nLEAVEN\n27. I know where the exit is.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhere?\n\nLEAVEN\nStay away from me.\n\nWORTH\nBack off, Quentin!\n\nQUENTIN\nI just wanna know, don't you wanna know?\n\nLEAVEN\nYou remember that room we passed through before, the one with the \n\nco-ordinate larger than 26?\n\nWORTH\nWhat about it?\n\nLEAVEN\nThat co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube.\n\nWORTH\nA bridge?\n\nLEAVEN\nRight, but only in it's original position.\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nLEAVEN\nLook, the room starts off as a bridge, then it moves it's way through the \n\nmaze, which is where we ran into it, but at some point it must return to it's \n\noriginal position.\n\nWORTH\nSo the bridge is just a bridge...\n\nLEAVEN\n... in a short period of time. This thing is like a giant \n\ncombinationlock, when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open. But \n\nwhen they move out of the linement the lock closes.\n\nWORTH\nWell the size of us... It must take days to complete a full cycle.\n\nQUENTIN\nSo when does it open?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow we see Leaven doing some math again. Quentin crawls towards her.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nDon't! We find it's original co-ordinates by adding the numbers, the \n\npermutations is found by subtracting the numbers. It's it. The room moves to 0, 1 and \n\n-1 on the x-axis, 2, 5 and -7 on y, and 1, -1 and 0 on z.\n\nQUENTIN\nAnd what does that mean.\n\nLEAVEN\nYou suck in math? Ok, I need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint.\n\nWORTH\n666... 897... 466...\n\nQUENTIN\n567... 898... ok?\n\nLEAVEN\nYes!\n\nQUENTIN\nAnd 545... Did you get that?\n\nWORTH\n656... 778... 462...\n\nLEAVEN\nThat's enough. X is 17, y is 25 and z is 14. Which means this room makes \n\ntwo more moves before returning to it's original position.\n\nWORTH\nDo we have time?\n\nLEAVEN\nMaybe...\n\nQUENTIN\nThen let's go.\n\nWORTH\nCan you work out the traps in the system?\n\nQUENTIN\nFuck the traps, let's get to the bridge.\n\nWORTH\nWell you threw out our last boot, you fucking idiot.\n\nLEAVEN\nTechnically I can identify the traps.\n\nWORTH\nTechnically?\n\nLEAVEN\nFirst I thought they were identified by primenumbers, but they're not. \n\nThey're identified by a number that are the power of a prime.\n\nQUENTIN\nOk, so?\n\nWORTH\nCan you calculate that?\n\nLEAVEN\nThe numbers are huge.\n\nQUENTIN\nBut you can, right? You can?\n\nLEAVEN\nI have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set. Maybe if I had a \n\ncomputer...\n\nQUENTIN\nYou don't need a computer.\n\nLEAVEN\nYes, I do.\n\nQUENTIN\nFigure it out!\n\nLEAVEN\nYes, I do!\n\nQUENTIN\nI'm not dying in a fucking ratmaze.\n\nLEAVEN\nLook! No one in the whole world could do it mentally! Look at the number: \n\n567898545. There's no way I can factor that. I can't even start on 567. It's \n\nastronomical!\n\nKAZAN\nTwo... Astronomical.\n\nWORTH\nWhat did you say?\n\nKAZAN\nAstronomical.\n\nWORTH\nBefore that...\n\nKAZAN\nFactors...\n\nLEAVEN\nHow many factors Kazan? Of 567?\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat are you fucking kidding?\n\nLEAVEN\nHow many factors does 30 have?\n\nKAZAN\nThree... \n\nLEAVEN\nAnd seven?\n\nKAZAN\nOne... Gumdrop.\n\nLEAVEN\nI don't have any gumdrops.\n\nKAZAN\nGumdrop!\n\nWORTH\nKazan, I'll give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer.\n\nKAZAN\nGumdrops come in bags.\n\nWORTH\nYou want 'em in bags, you got 'em in bags.\n\nKAZAN\nI don't like the red ones.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth opens a door and tells the numbers to Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\n8-9-8.\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nWORTH\n5-4-5.\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nLEAVEN\nHe's giving us the factors.\n\nKAZAN\nAstronomical.\n\nQUENTIN\nYou're telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius.\n\nLEAVEN\nBy those numbers the room should be safe.\n\nQUENTIN\nThere's only one way to find out.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin takes Worth and throws him into the room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nDon't!\n\nWORTH\nSafe.\n\nQUENTIN\nKazan, my man!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin tries to make Kazan give him the factors.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhat's the numbers boy? Right here! Look here! Make him do it.\n\nLEAVEN\nKazan, we gonna do some numbers, ok? We like to do numbers, right?\n\nKAZAN\nPrimenumbers.\n\nLEAVEN\nThat's right. Can you tell me the factors of 656?\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nLEAVEN\n779...\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nLEAVEN\n462...\n\nKAZAN\nThree...\n\nLEAVEN\nClear.\n\nQUENTIN\nMove. Come on let's go. You too Worth. Move your scuddy ass Worth, I'm \n\nnot through with you yet. Leaven open up that door, and get Einstein working on the \n\nnumbers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nAs Quentin has his head in the room, Worth closes the door and tries to choke \n\nQuentin.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nOh, Jesus!\n\nWORTH\nGo! Hurry!\n\nQUENTIN\nLeaven.\n\nLEAVEN\n563... Come on Kazan... 563...\n\nQUENTIN\nYou fuckheads, you're dead!\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nLEAVEN\nClear...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin gets his head out, and Worth closes the door. Next we see the number 384.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nOne..\n\nLEAVEN\nTrapped!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth enters the room and closes the door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nCheck the floor.\n\nLEAVEN\nIs he dead?\n\nWORTH\nNot quite.\n\nQUENTIN\nNot even close, Worth! When I'm finish I'll throw you in a fucking trap \n\non the way out of here.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nOn the other side of the door, we see Quentin opening the door.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nWhere is he? Come here! I said come here riiight..........\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin falls down in the room under the floor. We see Worth hanging down there. \n\nAfterwards Leaven and Kazan help Worth up from there.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nGot ya. That way.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nNow we see the number 805\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nTwo...\n\nLEAVEN\nClear.\n\nKAZAN\nFour...\n\nLEAVEN\nClear.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe next door they open lead them to the edge again. This time there's much more \n\nlight out there.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nOh.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven puts her head outside the room, and quickly takes it back. A room is passing \n\nby. When they open the door again, there's a room there.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nI guess that proves out theory. The numbers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe see two numbers: 206 911 xxx\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKAZAN\nFour, two, three.\n\nLEAVEN\nClear.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThey enter the new room, except Kazan, the room they just came from moves away.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN/WORTH\nKAZAN!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the background we hear Kazan screaming.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nListen. He hasn't moved far.\n\nWORTH\nI'm gonna find him. What do you think?\n\nLEAVEN\nYou don't have a lot of lives left.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWe see Kazan in a red room. He's terrified. Then we see Worth entering a blue room, \n\nthen we see Leaven step on a piece of glass, the one from her glasses. Then we see \n\nWorth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nKazan?\n\nKAZAN\nI didn't move.\n\nWORTH\nYeah, good. Erm, you have to climb up here, ok?\n\nKAZAN\nI don't like that.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven opens a door and studies the numbers.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\n14... 26... 14... WORTH GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!\n\nWORTH\nFive bags of gumdrops?\n\nKAZAN\n27 bags total.\n\nWORTH\n27 bags, deal.\n\nLEAVEN\nCome here Worth, this room's next move takes it to the bridge.\n\nWORTH\nWe're coming.\n\nLEAVEN\nOver here. Move it. We don't have much time come on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth and Kazan crawls in to Leaven's room. Leaven closes the door. They just make \n\nit, before the room moves. As we see the group again, they lie down.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWorth...\n\nWORTH\nEaoh, it' better be it.\n\nLEAVEN\nIt should be.\n\nWORTH\nWhere?\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven opens a door, there's nothing behind it. She closes it again.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nOoh, arh.\n\nLEAVEN\nGive me a minute. Be patient. So guess what, this was the room we started \n\nin. I was right, we should never have moved in the first place.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe room starts to shake, it's moving. As it stops, Leaven opens the door. We see a \n\nred room.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nThe bridge.\n\nKAZAN\nRed...\n\nLEAVEN\nKazan.\n\nKAZAN\n38079\n\nLEAVEN\nClear!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nThey enter the red room. Leaven closes the door. Kazan opens a new door. We see \n\ndaylight. Worth sits down.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nWorth???\n\nWORTH\nGo ahead.\n\nLEAVEN\nWhat are you doing. You can't quit now. It's not your fault!!!\n\nWORTH\nI have nothing to live for out there.\n\nLEAVEN\nWas is out there.\n\nWORTH\nBoundless human stupidity.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the background we hear a door opening.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLEAVEN\nI can live with that.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nLeaven says some strange sounds, she rises. Behind her we see Quentin with a door \n\nhandle. Quentin has stabbed Leaven in the back. He drops her to the floor. He's \n\ncovered with blood. Kazan closes the door to the daily life.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nNooo!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nWorth hits Quentin quite hard. But just after Quentin does the same to Worth.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWORTH\nKazan get out to the door!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuentin stabs Worth with the handle. Worth falls to the ground. Quentin tries to \n\nreach Kazan.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nQUENTIN\nRed, Kazan.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nKazan opens the door. Meanwhile the room starts to move. As Kazan is outside the \n\nroom, Quentin grabs his t-shirt. As he is just halfway out he can't move anymore. \n\nWorth holds Quentins leg. Quentin gets split up in two parts. Afterwards we see the \n\nroom move. There's blood on the inner cube. In the room again we see Worth crawl \n\ntowards Leaven. Halfway he stops moving he dies. The last we see of the movie is \n\nKazan looking at the inner cube, before he turns around and disappears into the \n\nbright, white light.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCube\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Andr\u00e9 Bijelic\u00a0\u00a0Vincenzo Natali\u00a0\u00a0Graeme Manson\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:23.679866"}
