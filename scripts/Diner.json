Sports jacket, button-\r\n          down shirt, chino pants, and Bass weejuns. We sense\r\n          that he is a little lost in himself, confused. He looks\r\n          out one of the windows that views the parking lot. Then\r\n          without any outward anger, he punches his fist through a\r\n          window pane.
