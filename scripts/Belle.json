RUSTIC STUDIO OF AN ARTISAN. DAY 1                         1   *\r\n\r\n    A series of shots.\r\n\r\n    Blue sky through shabby windows.\r\n    Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint\r\n    brushes soaking in stained jars.\r\n    An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush\r\n    in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.\r\n\r\n    A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed\r\n    as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster\r\n    girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later\r\n    recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)\r\n    CAPTION: ENGLAND 1766\r\n\r\n\r\n2   EXT/INT. DOCKS/SLUM ROOM. ENGLAND - DAY. 2                      2   *\r\n\r\n    A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky.   SOUND of footsteps\r\n    trudging through mud.\r\n    EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -\r\n    a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.\r\n    CLOSE: heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums.\r\n\r\n    Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.\r\n\r\n    A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.\r\n    Hold this image as Handel comes to an END.\r\n\r\n\r\n3   INT.

We see a gentleman in\r\n    ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,\r\n    aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.\r\n\r\n    His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-\r\n    open...We see what he sees...\r\n    A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby\r\n    surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving\r\n    LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate\r\n    with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.\r\n\r\n    She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.\r\n                                                                 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n    He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.\r\n\r\n                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY\r\n              Hello little girl...Little Dido.\r\n                  (pause)\r\n              I am your father.\r\n    Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her\r\n    confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.\r\n\r\n    His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.\r\n                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)\r\n                  (re.

Then she is gone.\r\n    DIDO is left frightened and stunned!\r\n\r\n                        CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)\r\n              Do not be afraid sweet thing. I\r\n              am to take you to a good life.\r\n              The life you were born to.\r\n\r\n    He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is\r\n    reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves\r\n    forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes\r\n    it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is\r\n    filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud.\r\n\r\n\r\n4   EXT. DOCKS - DAY. 2                                          4    *\r\n\r\n    A driver, HARRY - seated at a fine carriage.\r\n\r\n    As HARRY becomes alarmed - from his POV LINDSAY moves\r\n    towards us - the mulatto child in arms.\r\n                                                                 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n5   EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE. LAWNS. DAY. 2                            5    *\r\n\r\n    Silence, except bird song - the splendor of the English\r\n    countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us.\r\n    The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her\r\n    giggle fills the air, her outline faded by the sun.\r\n    At French doors to the nursery, a furious greying woman -\r\n    LADY MARY MURRAY (40s), waves a wooden spoon and yells...\r\n\r\n                         LADY MARY\r\n               Elizabeth Murray, bring yourself\r\n               back here this very moment!\r\n\r\n    The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter. She is\r\n    no more than 6 years old - Hair the colour of bleached hay\r\n    and delicate pale skin.\r\n\r\n    She rolls on to her back, squinting at the sunlight as...\r\n    The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house.\r\n    ELIZABETH bolts upright. Her POV: As CAPTAIN SIR JOHN\r\n    LINDSAY guides DIDO from the carriage.\r\n    WIMBRIDGE, the butler, steps out to receive them.\r\n\r\n\r\n6   INT.   KENWOOD HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM.

She is a MULATTO!\r\n\r\nLORD MANSFIELD'S blood boils, he rages towards LINDSAY. LADY\r\nMANSFIELD restrains him. LINDSAY is red with humiliation.\r\n\r\n                    CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY\r\n          I have no wife to take her...In a\r\n          few hours I am to captain a\r\n          voyage to the Indies on a\r\n          longitude experiment.\r\n              (strained)\r\n          From there, who knows!!!

He turns his back - aggrieved.\r\n\r\n                    LADY MANSFIELD\r\n          We...we will call her Dido.\r\n              (off Lindsay's nod)\r\n          Good Lord, she is thin. Mary,\r\n          find her something to eat.\r\nLORD MANSFIELD storms from the room. LADY MANSFIELD\r\nfollows.

He presses his lips to her hand, sobbing a\r\nmoment, and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be\r\ntoo much to bare.\r\n                                                                 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n7   INT.

LADY MARY rushes after her.\r\n    DIDO is left alone - through the doorway of the gallery, a\r\n    portrait of LINDSAY stares at her. She gazes at it.\r\n\r\n    LORD MANSFIELD approaches, arrested at the sight of DIDO,\r\n    newly tidied. He follows her gaze to LINDSAY'S image. The\r\n    sight affects him, unexpectedly.\r\n                        LORD MANSFIELD\r\n              Captain Sir John Lindsay.\r\n                  (off her reaction)\r\n              Do you recognise him?\r\n    She nods.

And then her fingers come up to the skin on her\r\n     chest...and she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred,\r\n     rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek, her\r\n     forehead, as her face crumples and she begins to cry.\r\n                                                               30.\r\n\r\n\r\n33   EXT.

JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he\r\n     touches her hand absentmindedly, startling her, but their\r\n     eyes remain locked. She attempts, weakly, to return self-\r\n     possession. Then almost a whisper...\r\n\r\n                            DIDO\r\n               Thank you.\r\n\r\n     That is, thank you for telling me what nobody else has!\r\n\r\n     She turns, walks away.

Not your usual game, Oliver.\r\n\r\n     OLIVER examines his father.\r\n                         LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)\r\n               She can not know your thoughts\r\n               unless you offer them to her.\r\n     He moves off, leaving OLIVER pensive.\r\n                                                             45.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LORD ASHFORD (CONT'D)\r\n          The ladies Mansfield! As sweet on\r\n          the eye as the freshest flowers\r\n          in bloom....\r\n              (off Lady M's laughter)\r\n          What is in those glasses?\r\nON OLIVER as he moves to the pond.

His eyes light up.\r\n                    ELIZABETH\r\n          Oh Dido look - Mr James has made\r\n          me a boat and it has capsized.\r\nJAMES stretches a branch into the lake to rescue the boat.\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          What a dreadful shame.\r\n\r\nOLIVER collects paper from the grass. CLOSE on his hands as\r\nhe folds it into a boat under DIDO'S nose.\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n              (to DIDO, earnest)\r\n          For you.\r\nShe smiles, can't help being charmed.\r\n\r\n                       DIDO\r\n          Thank you.\r\nHe places it in the water, stands and examines DIDO. From\r\nafar, LADY MANSFIELD watches.\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n          Miss Lindsay, would you do me the\r\n          honour of taking some air with\r\n          me, some time?\r\nDIDO is dumbstruck - what to say? JAMES is halted.\r\n                    JAMES\r\n          Don't you care what people will say\r\n                                                                46.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DIDO is jolted by the antangonism in JAMES' tone -\r\n     ELIZABETH too - it pierces her and she speaks up.\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n               What is that to mean Mr James?\r\n               What should anyone say?!\r\n     JAMES hesitates, then...\r\n\r\n                         JAMES\r\n               That he should compromise a\r\n               lady's reputation by stepping out\r\n               with her - scarcely having made\r\n               her acquaintance!\r\n                         OLIVER\r\n               I think you are a great deal too\r\n               anxious, brother. We should merely\r\n               take a turn around Vauxhall.\r\n     DIDO observes JAMES - His protestation is bitter. She\r\n     traces OLIVER'S features, warmly.\r\n                         DIDO\r\n               I should be delighted, Mr Oliver!\r\n               Most delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n60   INT. MANSFIELD CARRIAGE. LONDON STREETS. DAY.10            60    *\r\n\r\n     On the move through London streets. LADIES MANSFIELD and\r\n     MARY sit quietly. ELIZABETH whispers to DIDO.\r\n                         ELIZABETH\r\n               Are you really to defy Papaa?\r\n\r\n     DIDO says nothing, turns to stare out of the window.\r\n\r\n\r\n61   EXT.

DUSK/NIGHT.11              61    *\r\n\r\n     Teaming with parasols, fountains, and hidden pathways.\r\n     61.1: JAMES and ELIZABETH stroll, followed by DIDO and\r\n     OLIVER, then, LADIES MANSFIELD, MARY, and ASHFORD.\r\n\r\n                          LADY MANSFIELD\r\n                   (re.

This is\r\n               simply two families, enjoying a\r\n               day together.\r\n     LADY MANSFIELD takes an unhappy breath, burdened.\r\n                                                           47.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LADY ASHFORD (CONT'D)\r\n          Though surely...IF a desirable\r\n          match were a ... certain...\r\n          possibility your dear husband could\r\n          have no objections, could he?\r\nLADY MANSFIELD, turns slowly to regard LADY ASHFORD,\r\naroused by the insinuation and alarmed at the same time.\r\nShe looks back to DIDO and OLIVER, wide eyed.\r\n\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n          Well I did not think I would ever\r\n          find a lady who was not to be\r\n          conquered or ignored...Until you.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Ah now how do I know this is not\r\n          just another tactic in your\r\n          battle to conquer?\r\nHe stops, takes her hand and places it on in his chest.\r\n\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n          See how my heart beats.\r\n\r\nShe lets her hand rest a moment.\r\n\r\n                    OLIVER (CONT'D)\r\n          I am utterly taken with you, Miss\r\n          Lindsay.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Despite...such pronounced\r\n          protestations from your brother?\r\n\r\n                     OLIVER\r\n          He cannot overlook your mother's\r\n          origins, as I do. Foolish. Why\r\n          should anyone even pay her regard\r\n          when your better half has equipped\r\n          you so well with loveliness and\r\n          privilege.\r\n\r\nDido is stung. OLIVER shrugs, oblivious. The sound of Handel\r\nfilters from a nearby concert. DIDO tries hard to recover.\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          What a lovely sound.\r\n\r\nHe smiles at her, studies her...mischievous...\r\n\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n          You are unrelentingly cultured.\r\n          Come, let's find it!\r\nHe takes her waist spinning her round with him into another\r\npathway, disappearing from the others, giggling as they go.\r\n                                                           48.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LADY MANSFIELD\r\n          People will think she has no family!\r\n                    LADY ASHFORD.\r\n          People will think they are courting!\r\nLADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY exchange a look. LADY MARY is\r\nsomehow softened - her eyes appeal to LADY MANSFIELD...\r\n\r\n                    LADY MARY\r\n          Let her enjoy his society.\r\nLADY MANSFIELD is effected - reads MARY'S emotion.\r\n61.2: An open pavilion with classical concert. ON OLIVER\r\nand DIDO watching.\r\n\r\n                    OLIVER\r\n          I might only have dreamed of\r\n          these moments, at one time.\r\n\r\nDIDO smiles - allows herself to be flattered.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Really? You are much of the\r\n          conqueror Mr Oliver.\r\nHe chuckles, brings his hand up to brush her cheek, gently.\r\nShe smiles just as her eyes fall on the back of a gentleman's\r\nhead, shoulders - his movement somehow familiar.\r\nThe sight roots her, uncertain of what she sees. And then\r\nhe turns to address another, and his profile becomes clear.\r\n\r\nIt is JOHN DAVINIER.\r\nIn that moment, he flicks his head round and his gaze falls\r\non her - a beat between them then his eyes fall on OLIVER.\r\nJOHN excuses himself from others and makes his way across.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          Miss Lindsay.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n              (flushed)\r\n          Mr Davinier.

The spit and bang of spectacular fireworks. OLIVER\r\nstands engrossed as the sky lights up. DIDO looks up at\r\nhim. She wavers. Then...slowly she backs away from the crowd\r\n\r\n                                                   CUT TO:\r\n\r\n61.4 DIDO walks quickly - follows the sound of the concert\r\nto find her way back to JOHN.\r\n\r\nHer POV: JOHN listening diligently to the music. He double\r\ntakes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the\r\nconcert. He stands alarmed, negotiates his way to her.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n              (dismayed)\r\n          Miss Lindsay, you are alone!!\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          I did not have the chance to see\r\n          you before you left...Mr Davinier\r\n          ...to convey my apologies.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          Apologies...?\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Your pupilage. Father would\r\n          never have ended it...you...you\r\n          never would have had to leave\r\n          Kenwood were it not...\r\n                                                             50.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis eyes soften as he looks at her...\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          He would make mine a living hell,\r\n          were he to know of us speaking.\r\nDIDO tugs him into a quiet lane, away from the concert and\r\npromenading.\r\n\r\nHardly a breath and BAM!! She is slammed against a walled\r\nmaze, suddenly!! JOHN pressed against her tightly!\r\nConfused, her gaze darts around her, finds LADY MANSFIELD\r\nand LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path, oblivious.\r\nDIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN. She stares\r\npanicked into his eyes and he into hers.\r\n\r\n61.5:CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by\r\nwith JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO, instantly.\r\n\r\nELIZABETH is stunned!!!! But doesn't falter.\r\n61.4 CONT'D: As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but\r\nanonymous strangers, leaving them none the wiser to being\r\ndiscovered. JOHN pulls away, embarrassed...\r\n                    JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n          Forgive me.\r\nShe nods, equally bashful. They regard each other.\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          What are you doing here in London\r\n          Mr Davinier?\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          I am under a third cousin - a\r\n          solicitor, here. Nothing more\r\n          than petty disputes between\r\n          unsavoury landlords and debauched\r\n          tenants, but I cannot discount it.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Not what you wished for.\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          I haven't given up on The Inns.\r\n          Nothing worth having in life\r\n          comes easily.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n              (flushed)\r\n          Where are my manners?

Freemen\r\n          and slaves alike!\r\nHer eyes begin to sting at the `integrity' in his words.\r\n                    JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n              (enthused)\r\n          I am with others here.

A simple clause.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          But that would require a change\r\n          of law. I know nothing but...\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          A change in law - something the\r\n          insurance companies can lobby for\r\n          IF they can be persuaded to band\r\n          together.\r\n              (softly,)\r\n          We may only be students,\r\n          but...change is most always\r\n          precipitated by the young.\r\n              (shrugs - poignant)\r\n          Someone has to have the courage.\r\n          How can we expect to be civilised\r\n          if we live in a barbaric world.\r\nHis words wind her as JOHN shakes his head, frustrated.

It's\r\n          the shame of a law that would\r\n          uphold a financial transaction\r\n          upon that atrocity.\r\nShe is scathing and accepting all at once, affecting him.\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          That is indeed the truth.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes are locked.

The BUTLER sweeps by\r\n                          MR VAUGHAN (OOV)\r\n                Lady Mansfield...Miss Murray...\r\n\r\n      As MR VAUGHAN enters Elizabeth descends into a curtsey.\r\n                          LADY MANSFIELD\r\n                Mr Vaughan, how kind of you to come.\r\n                          ELIZABETH\r\n                I have thought of nothing else\r\n                but showing you Aunt Mary's\r\n                chrysanthemums, Mr Vaughan.\r\n                          MR VAUGHAN\r\n                What a pleasure, Miss Murray.\r\n                          ELIZABETH\r\n                You too Mamaa.\r\n\r\n      She drags them away, sending DIDO a final surreptitious\r\n      glance that says, the coast is clear for her. As she does,\r\n      LADY MARY'S gaze follows - sees DIDO hiding. A beat. LADY\r\n      MARY hangs back - smiles satisfied to herself, before\r\n      moving off.\r\n                                                                   96.\r\n\r\n\r\n120   EXT. BLOOMSBURY SQUARE. MANSFIELD HOME.   DAY.26             120   *\r\n\r\n      A hooded DIDO steps from the house. HARRY's heart sinks.\r\n\r\n                          HARRY\r\n                NO! Never again!\r\n\r\n                          DIDO\r\n                Fine! Then step down and allow me\r\n                to take the reigns.\r\n\r\n      Harry rubs his eyes, burdened. Then...far from jovial..\r\n                          HARRY\r\n                Had I known you were to be such\r\n                trouble, I'd `ave driven off\r\n                before Captain Sir John Lindsay\r\n                bought you to my carriage!\r\n\r\n\r\n121   EXT. WESTMINSTER HALL. LONDON. DAY.26                        121   *\r\n\r\n      A myriad of people flood into the court - politicians,\r\n      clergy, shipping merchants, abolitionists...and insurers.\r\n      DIDO steps from the carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n122   INT. WESTMINSTER HALL. LONDON. CONTINUOUS. DAY.26            122   *\r\n      As they pour through the doors, we settle first on LORD\r\n      ASHFORD, then, JOHN DAVINIER, pushing into the room.\r\n                                                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n      Moments later...DIDO pushes into the court. She lays eyes on\r\n      JOHN, seated - forces her way past seated men, seen at\r\n      earlier meetings. JOHN stands, overwhelmed as she approaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n123   INT. WESTMINSTER HALL. LONDON. DAY.26                        123   *\r\n      LORD MANSFIELD enters - sits, flanked by two LAW LORDS. He\r\n      appears profoundly focused - reserved, despite the chaos of\r\n      the filled room. His eyes dance across the sea of faces.\r\n\r\n                          CLERK\r\n                Silence in the court!\r\n      DIDO's hand slides to JOHN'S.\r\n\r\n                          LORD MANSFIELD\r\n                Whether the `jettison clause' of\r\n                Marine Insurance Law may be brought\r\n                to bear in this appeal. This is\r\n                the question. That is, first:\r\n                whether the slaves were drowned\r\n                as an anticipatory act. An act to\r\n                avoid the disease caused by their\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n                                                           97.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          journey, killing them once on shore,\r\n          and at their destination...depriving\r\n          the slave owners of any compensation.\r\nHe takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          Or secondly: whether they were\r\n          `jettisoned' as cargo! To save\r\n          captain and crew from certain death,\r\n          when the extended journey threatened\r\n          shortage of drinking-water.\r\n              (steely eyed)\r\n          Let me be clear, loss of water on a\r\n          ship constitutes a singularly\r\n          dangerous affair - insurrection of\r\n          thirsty and hostile slaves at its\r\n          extreme - and an impossible task to\r\n          share diminished water reserve, among\r\n          all those living, at best. Each\r\n          implies severe threat to the lives of\r\n          the seamen. In such circumstances our\r\n          law is transparent and equivocal -\r\n          the jettisoning of enslaved cargo\r\n          ...IS legal!\r\n              (he spells it out)\r\n          And in these circumstances, combined\r\n          with unavoidable loss of water, our\r\n          laws leave the ship-owners securely\r\n          within their rights to make a claim\r\n          ...and behoves the insurers to pay\r\n          losses.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          No!\r\n\r\nGasps from around the room...gasps that turn into cries,\r\nincluding DIDO'S own. JOHN is rigid, anger rising.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD\r\n          The ship's owners chose a tight\r\n          `packing fashion' to transport\r\n          the slaves...A popular fashion of\r\n          transportation that is known for\r\n          causing death and disease.\r\n\r\nHis voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court.\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          This choice of laying the slaves\r\n          tightly together is undertaken at\r\n          the Captain's own risk. In the\r\n          event that over packing renders\r\n          an avoidable lack of drinking water\r\n          on board a protracted journey,\r\n          such a decision may be viewed as\r\n          simple `bad management' on a\r\n                    (MORE)\r\n                                                             98.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          Captain's part, and further, weigh\r\n          as his own risk. An extended journey\r\n          - one in which the destination is\r\n          overshot may also be viewed as\r\n          the captain's own mismanagement.\r\nThe noise lowers to silence. LORD MANSFIELD settles on JOHN.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          It is not legal...to discharge lives\r\n          from a ship into the waters, to\r\n          prevent those lives dying on land,\r\n          and to facilitate insurance\r\n          compensation. Whether they be the\r\n          lives of horses... or human beings\r\n          ...slaves or otherwise - It is\r\n          not legal, neither is it right.\r\n\r\nDIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief.\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          Further, the claim of shortage of\r\n          water is illegitimate shown by the\r\n          evidence put forward. To my\r\n          mind, it is clear a fraud has been\r\n          committed in claiming insurance on\r\n          slaves who were...drowned solely\r\n          for financial gain.\r\nHe looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD's acceptance.\r\nHis eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain.\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          It is my opinion, that the state of\r\n          slavery is so odious a position that\r\n          nothing may support it. This case\r\n          has displayed with searing clarity\r\n          the depravity of any such nation\r\n          whose choice is to practice it. You\r\n          may be certain that I have laboured\r\n          over my judgement and statements\r\n          today and am in full understanding\r\n          of all of the ramifications. Justice\r\n          be done,though the heavens may fall.\r\nJOHN'S eyes brim at the realisation of those words.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n          I find in favour of the insurers\r\n          and overturn the decision of the\r\n          lower court. I order a retrial.\r\n\r\nStunned confusion in the courtroom. Then, all kinds of\r\ncommotion - anger, cheers amid shock. LORD MANSFIELD stands.\r\n\r\n                      CLERK\r\n          All rise!\r\n                                                                   99.\r\n\r\n\r\n      JOHN jumps up, desperate for eye contact through the\r\n      commotion...but LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead, moves off.\r\n      DIDO stands, caught by her own breath. JOHN turns to her.\r\n      She begins to sob. For the first time he pulls her close,\r\n\r\n      WIDE on the court room - JOHN holding DIDO as she sobs.\r\n      Through the judges' exit - a figure, in the shadows. REVEAL\r\n      LORD MANSFIELD, taking in DIDO and JOHN, affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n124   EXT. WESTMINSTER HALL. STREETS - DAY.26                      124   *\r\n      JOHN watches as DIDO races back to the carriage. ON their\r\n      reaction - LORD MANSFIELD stands waiting.\r\n      As DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD come before each other. Everything\r\n      in their eyes - restrained emotion over a long beat.\r\n                          DIDO\r\n                You may not blame Mr Davinier\r\n                ...My attendance today is\r\n                absolutely at my own volition\r\n                ...for matters which concern me.\r\n\r\n                          LORD MANSFIELD\r\n                I am fully aware, Dido.\r\n\r\n      He fixes on JOHN. JOHN is apprehensive.\r\n                          JOHN\r\n                M'Lord...I am inspired by your\r\n                decision today. We will not go\r\n                backwards from here.\r\n                          LORD MANSFIELD\r\n                    (burdened)\r\n                History will judge if your\r\n                optimism is warranted...(beat)...\r\n                You are a man of conviction.\r\n\r\n      JOHN swallows hard, emotion rising, stinging his eyes.\r\n                          JOHN\r\n                I am trying to be.\r\n                          LORD MANSFIELD\r\n                Then your efforts are not in vain.\r\n\r\n      DIDO moves to JOHN'S side, taking his hand. LORD\r\n      MANSFIELD's eyes drop to their clasped fingers.\r\n\r\n                          LORD MANSFIELD (CONT'D)\r\n                I have not changed my mind. She\r\n                is to marry a gentleman.\r\n      He turns and begins to move to the carriage.   JOHN stares\r\n      at the ground, humiliated. DIDO is incensed.\r\n                                                             100.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman?\r\nHer voice rings out, furious. LORD MANSFIELD stops...\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD\r\n          He is...indeed...Dido.\r\n              (he speaks carefully)\r\n          And that is why he ought to have\r\n          a job befitting one.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n              (a whisper - defiant)\r\n          My affections are with him, Papaa.\r\n          I wish for nothing...\r\n          nothing, if not to be his wife.\r\n\r\nShe stares into LORD MANSFIELD's eyes - he takes in JOHN.\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD\r\n          If you would Mr Davinier, I would\r\n          like you to attend my chambers in\r\n          the morning. There are matters I\r\n          would like you to assist me with.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          Your Lordship?\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD\r\n          And if you think it a good\r\n          idea...I wish to facilitate\r\n          your entry to the Inns of Court.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n              (tentative)\r\n          That is to serve my qualification\r\n          to The Bar?\r\nThe question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN, is now answered.\r\n\r\n                    LORD MANSFIELD\r\n          Indeed...(humbled)...Capabilities\r\n          such as yours are clearly\r\n          deserving of such considerations.\r\nJOHN breathes heavily, also humbled, as his tears surface.\r\n\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          I..I think it a very good idea, sir.\r\n\r\nLORD MANSFIELD nods, then finally moves off.    JOHN can't\r\ntake it in. DIDO is breathless, eyes brim...\r\n                    JOHN (CONT'D)\r\n          Can it be true?\r\n                                                            101.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          Of course. He sees what I see.\r\n          His words were as clear as...\r\n                    JOHN\r\n          No! That your feelings for me are\r\n          so? That you would be my wife..?\r\n              (off her reaction, )\r\n          Because, I cannot conceive of a\r\n          life without you...and if...if\r\n          such were all that were before\r\n          me, Miss Lindsay, then my heart\r\n          would never beat the same again.\r\n                    DIDO\r\n          It is not. It is not all that is\r\n          before you Mr Davinier...\r\n          (begins sobbing) I love you...for\r\n          all that you are, and with\r\n          all..all that I am.\r\n\r\nHe breaks down now too, wiping her tears before kissing her\r\nthrough his own sobs. Then tears turn to laughter.\r\n\r\nWe draw back on the couple - two fragile figures, amid the\r\nbustle of London town.\r\nON the MANSFIELD crest as LORD MANSFIELD'S carriage moves\r\noff, a solitary figure inside, staring straight ahead.\r\nTHE END\r\n FOXSEARCHLIGHT.COM/AWARDS\r\nReleased by Twentieth Century Fox \u00a9 2014 Twentieth Century Fox\r\n\n\n\n\nBelle\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Misan Sagay\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:20:41.038692"}
