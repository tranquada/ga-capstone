There is the sound of\n    a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies.\n    THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from\n    another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish-\n    able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete\n    walls and dies away. Silence.\n    SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:\n\n1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1\n\n    FRANK FARMER'S FACE -\n    mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He\n    is The Bodyguard.\n    ANGLE - HIT MAN\n    dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops\n    heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly\n    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face\n    down on the  cement floor.\n    A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of\n    KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the\n    filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,\n    50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear\n    as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There\n    is no movement.\n    The two men are lying near the right front fender of a\n    black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit\n    man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself\n    up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still\n    alert for any further threat.\n    MAIN TITLES BEGIN.\n    A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub-\n    nosed .357 aimed at them.\n                            FRANK\n               Freeze!\n    ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE\n    A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.

It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness.\n\n2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2\n\n     Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.\n     Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all\n     the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering\n     image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman\n     as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the\n     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning\n     lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her\n     song \"I have Nothing.\"\n\n\n2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A\n     A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile\n     of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of\n     magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control,\n     softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw\n     in the store window, the same song.\n     Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove\n     a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the\n     gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.\n     The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars.\n     They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A\n     headline on the cover reads: \"RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST\n     TRIUMPH!\" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they\n     excise the name \"RACHEL MARRON\" from the page. With the\n     care of a surgeon.\n\n3    EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT                            3\n     A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms\n     stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones\n     are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of \"Rachel!\n     Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,\n     Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\" We cannot see the object of\n     this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,\n     well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other\n     celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside\n     by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm\n     and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.\n\n5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5\n     In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-\n     ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur,\n     he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer.\n\n                                                                   3.\n\n                          KLINGMAN\n             Your hands ever shake, Frank?\n                           FRANK\n             Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.\n                          KLINGMAN\n             ... How did you know?\n                          FRANK\n             I saw him washing the car.\n                          KLINGMAN\n             I saw him.\n                          FRANK\n             They don't wash cars on the\n             parking levels.\n    He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.\n                          KLINGMAN\n             You know, I'd like you to stay on.\n    He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank.\n                          FRANK\n             I'm not good in permanent\n             positions, my feet go to sleep.\n    The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses\n    in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.\n\n6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6\n    The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word \"TIME\" onto\n    a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom\n    note. Each word has been cut from a different page and\n    is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled\n    with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance\n    and is quite easy to read. It reads:\n             MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING\n             I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME TO DIE IS ...\n\n7   EXT. CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING                             7\n    A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper,\n    autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.\n    Again, a mass chanting \"Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\"\n    Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered\n    items.\n    In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing \"Best wishes,\n\n                                                                     4.\n\n     Rachel Marron\" on an out-stretched open palm. In the\n     midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be-\n     ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend\n     \"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU.\"\n\n8    EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8\n\n     SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two\n     suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a\n     small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-\n     cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.\n     Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a\n     few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A\n     curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the\n     door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail\n     inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go\n     inside. The door shuts.\n\n10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10\n     Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table\n     in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a\n     glass beside it.\n     At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and\n     reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He\n     lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat.\n     At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently\n     eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on\n     the plate and eats from it directly while glancing\n     through the magazine.\n\n11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11\n     Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room.\n     There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack-\n     ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the\n     mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll\n     with its embroidered ribbon message \"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU.\"\n     Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers\n     resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is\n     an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging\n     applause, bowing.\n     The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the\n     LIGHT BULBS.\n     The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and\n     CONFUSION.\n     TITLES END.\n\n                                                                      5.\n\n\n12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12\n     Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-\n     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of\n     \"DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE\" come from a beat-up transistor\n     RADIO.\n\n     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back\n     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives\n     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of\n     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.\n     BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black\n     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a\n     conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.\n     He's Rachel's personal manager.\n                           DEVANEY\n              So, you won't protect Rachel Marron\n              just because she's in show business?\n                           FRANK\n              I don't do celebrities.\n                           DEVANEY\n              But the biggest money's in show\n              business people.\n     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-\n     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.\n     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It\n     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the\n     fence.\n     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his\n     eyes again.\n                           DEVANEY\n                     (picking up another\n                      knife)\n              Do you really do these things?\n                           FRANK\n              Isn't she the one who collects\n              dolls?\n     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.\n                           DEVANEY\n                     (exasperated)\n              Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the\n              most famous people in America. She's\n              won every music award invented. She's\n              got the number one song in the country\n              right now and she'll probably be\n              nominated for an Oscar in her very\n\n                                                           6.\n\n         first picture. And you want to know\n         'Isn't she the one...?' Christ,\n         man, where've you been?\n                      FRANK\n         You mean she doesn't collect dolls?\n\n                        DEVANEY\n                  (defeated)\n         Yes.    She collects dolls.\n                      FRANK\n         I thought I knew who she was.\nDevaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or\nnot. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with\na knife.\n                      DEVANEY\n         You're probably deadly with these\n         things, aren't you?\n                       FRANK\n         Deadly.\n                       DEVANEY\n         Show me.\nFrank doesn't move.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Why are you resisting this job?\n         $2,000 bucks a week.\n                (no response)\n         $2,500.\n                      FRANK\n         There are several good men\n         available for that kind of money.\n         Have you talked to Fitzgerald or\n         Racine? Portman?\n                       DEVANEY\n         Yeah.   Portman was interested...\nHe senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what\nhe takes to be the first serious talk.\n                      DEVANEY\n         ... but we're told you're the best.\n                      FRANK\n         There's no such thing.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Farmer, we're talking about a\n         very frightened lady. With a\n\n                                                                 7.\n\n         seven-year old son. Believe me,\n         I wouldn't be here if I didn't\n         think this was for real.\n                (long pause)\n         Farmer, she begged me to get you.\nFrank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time.\nHe picks up five throwing knives and stands up.\n                      FRANK\n         All right. I'll come and I'll look\n         the situation over. If I take it,\n         it's three thousand a week.\n                      DEVANEY\n                (whistles)\n         Okay. You must be very deadly\n         for three grand a week.\nFrank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He\nthrows one of the knives. It misses the post and\nclatters against the fence.\n                        FRANK\n         Shit.\nDevaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife.\n                      FRANK\n                (mumbling)\n         I know it's something like...\nThe second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc\nand disappears into some bushes about three feet from\nDevaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind\nFrank.\n                        FRANK\n         Sorry.\nFrank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and\nmotions Devaney off to the side.\n                      FRANK\n         Better not stand right behind me.\nDevaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go\nwith one smooth motion.\nThe knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP.\nFrank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives.\nBoth knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical\nline with the first one.\n\n                                                                     8.\n\n13   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY          13\n     Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street\n     from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron\n     driveway.\n     FRANK'S POV\n\n     as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation\n     and the rising grounds beyond.\n     (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be\n     taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re-\n     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in\n     the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant\n     vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and\n     his burden. The audience must be put in the position of\n     looking, searching, scanning with him.)\n     He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-\n     ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a\n     black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives\n     rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches\n     it go.\n     Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He\n     grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate\n     rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button\n     on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S\n     VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.\n                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n              Yes?\n                           FRANK\n              Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.\n                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n              What?\n                           FRANK\n              Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss\n              Marron!\n                           MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n                     (obviously has not heard)\n              Have you got an appointment?\n                           FRANK\n              The atomic number of zinc is 30.\n                             MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)\n              All right.\n     There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically\n     open.\n\n                                                                     9.\n\n\n14   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                        14\n     FRANK'S POV\n     as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land-\n     scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The\n     mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind\n     the mansion fall away.\n\n15   EXT. MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVE/ENTRANCE AREA - DAY          15\n     The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives\n     PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is\n     polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms\n     is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth\n     and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.\n     Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is\n     parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.\n                           HENRY\n              Can I help you?\n                           FRANK\n              Are you the man on the intercom?\n                            HENRY\n              No.   Can I help you?\n                           FRANK\n              My name is Edison.

A man in cover-\n     alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber.\n\n                                                                     10.\n\n                           FRANK\n              Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.\n                           EMMA\n              Come in, please.\n\n\n16   INT. MARRON MANSION - DAY                                  16\n     Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm,\n     matronly woman who does a fine job running the house\n     without standing on custom.\n                           EMMA\n              I'll tell you quite honestly,\n              Mr. Ford, I don't know where\n              Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd\n              be here?\n                           FRANK\n              Yes.\n                           EMMA\n              Then he probably is.   Let me look.\n     She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There\n     are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being\n     repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around,\n     Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening\n     titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song\n     itself -- \"I HAVE NOTHING\" -- comes softly from concealed\n     speakers.\n                            EMMA\n               Please make yourself at home. Can\n               I get you anything?\n     Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.\n     Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in\n     the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a\n     major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers\n     come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence.\n\n17   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY                  17\n     The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and\n     more lived-in rooms appear.\n\n18   INT. MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18\n     Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool\n     area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are\n     shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career:\n     A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records,\n     other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo-\n     graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and\n\n                                                                     11.\n\n     her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are\n     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank\n     looks down at the pool.\n     FRANK'S POV\n     Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven-\n     year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,\n     dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of\n     the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long\n     speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny\n     sits, some way off, embroidering.\n     Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL\n     BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another\n     Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy.\n     Frank follows the sound.\n\n19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19\n     Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is\n     coming from.\n     It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a\n     bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It\n     is packed with people, props and video equipment. There\n     is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized\n     chaos. MUSIC BLARES out.\n     A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance\n     number for a music video, directed by their choreographer\n     RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the\n     glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman\n     circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a\n     large-screen TV behind them.\n     In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a\n     proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand-\n     ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All\n     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't\n     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among\n     the big cushions.\n     As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel\n     chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and\n     makes his way over to him.\n     On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his\n     late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch\n     neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right.\n     The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down.\n     Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins.\n     Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being\n     used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through\n     the rehearsal.\n\n                                                              12.\n\n\nIn one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties\n(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.\nShe glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next\nto a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at\nthe other end of the line.\n\nThe music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold\ntheir dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.\nAPPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.\nThen LAUGHTER.\nFrom elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO\nDIRECTOR.\n\n                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)\n         Playback, everybody!\nRachel's voice comes from the sofa.\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Come here, Rory!\nThe choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from\nsight. Sound of kissing, laughter.\nThe video rewinds on the big screen and the dancers gather\nround it expectantly.\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Sugar, that's gonna be great.    I\n         love the ending...\nDevaney moves to the front of the room. The PLAYBACK\nSTARTS behind him. There are several overlapping\nconversations going on.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Rachel...\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Nicki, how'd you like the number?\n         You like the end routine?\n                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)\n         Rachel. You wanna see it back\n         from the beginning or just the\n         ending...\nNICKI, responds to Rachel's question.\n                      NICKI\n         It was just great, Rory...\nBut Rachel is already replying to the video director.\n\n                                                               13.\n\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         I wanna see it all. Tony?      I'll\n         bet Tony loved it.\nThe brawny man, Tony, shrugs and stands to look at Frank\nas he speaks.\n\n                       TONY\n         Ehh!\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Don't worry, Rory. Tony doesn't\n         appreciate great art.\nThe pinned-up girl has been brought forward for Rachel's\napproval, elbowing Devaney a little to one side.\n\n                      DRESS DESIGNER\n                (showing the costume)\n         What do you think, Rachel?\n                      DEVANEY\n         Rachel, Frank Farmer is...\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Devaney, do you think this is me?\n                      DEVANEY\n                (not looking)\n         It's terrific...\nDevaney is now facing the unseen Rachel.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Rachel, Frank Farmer is here.\nDevaney nods in Frank's direction.     Nicki looks at Frank.\n                       RACHEL (O.S.)\n         Who's here?\n                      DEVANEY\n         Frank Farmer.\n                (getting no response)\n         The bodyguard.\n                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n         I think Rory should be my\n         bodyguard.\n                (to dress designer)\n         Let's see the back again...\n                      DEVANEY\n         Rachel, raise your butt out of\n         there and meet this man.\nRACHEL MARRON finally rises from the sofa.

Frank would\n     like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way. Frank\n     looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure. The\n     watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off.\n                            FLETCHER\n              Hi!\n                           FRANK\n                     (continuing to walk)\n              Hi.\n                           FLETCHER\n              How are you today?\n                           FRANK\n                     (wants to keep walking)\n              All right.

He is\n     holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he\n     holds the file casually at his side.\n     Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file.\n                           DEVANEY\n              How are you, Fletch?\n                     (to Frank)\n              I'm glad you waited.

Inside are letters of every size and condition.\n     Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to\n     Fletcher, who has started his boat again.\n                           DEVANEY\n              This is just in the last six months.\n                           FRANK\n                     (looks at the pile)\n              Have you ever tried having these\n              professionally assessed?\n     Devaney shakes his head no.\n     Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by\n     the corner of the page. From many different sources, some\n     are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts.\n     Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally,\n     one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it.\n     Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand\n     over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles\n     of letters.\n                           SPECTOR\n              Devaney says you were in the Secret\n              Service.\n     Frank nods.\n\n                                                            21.\n\n\nFrank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He\nsometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he\nremoves from the stack and places in the center of the\ntable.\n                      SPECTOR\n         Ever guard the main man?\n                      FRANK\n         I was two years with Carter and\n         four years with Reagan.\nFrank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops,\nsmiling at it.\n\n                      FRANK\n         This is a little old lady in\n         Akron. She's written to\n         everybody I've ever worked for.\nHe continues to turn until something stops him. Several\nletters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted-\nup type we saw being assembled on the desk top.\n                      SPECTOR\n         Reagan got shot.\nHis chatter is beginning to annoy Frank.\n                      FRANK\n         Not on my shift.\nSpector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke.\n                        SPECTOR\n         That's good.\nFrank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in\nthe center of the table.\n                      FRANK\n         At first glance, these don't\n         bother me. But keep them. You\n         never know.\nHe separates one letter from the others.\n                      FRANK\n         This could be something.\nDevaney searches Frank's face.\n                      DEVANEY\n         You think it could be the same\n         guy? The one who rigged the doll?\n\n                                                                      22.\n\n                           FRANK\n              I don't know. Did you tell Miss\n              Marron about it? Does she know\n              about the doll?\n     Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a\n     sore point between them.\n\n                           SPECTOR\n              We said there'd been some electrical\n              problem while she was on stage.\n              Short circuit. Look, she doesn't\n              need that kind of worry right now.\n              It would upset her.\n                           FRANK\n              What about the police?\n                           SPECTOR\n              There was no reason for the police.\n              No one got hurt.\n                           FRANK\n              What about the chauffeur?\n                           SPECTOR\n              It was nothing. It was just our\n              people there.\n     Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's\n     eyes are still on Frank's face.\n                           DEVANEY\n              Sy, I think we should show him\n              the room.\n\n23   INT.

He\n     glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the\n     kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from\n     the pages of a tabloid layout.\n                           FRANK\n              Is this her bedroom?\n                           SPECTOR\n              Yes.\n                           DEVANEY\n              No. She sleeps in a room next to\n              Fletcher's down the hall.

Fletcher isn't happy about it.\n\n28   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY                  28\n\n     Frank tours the house with Emma and Henry. Frank opens\n     various doors, fidgets with locking mechanisms. Emma\n     finds it all exciting.\n\n29   INT. MARRON ESTATE - POOL HOUSE/BALLET STUDIO - DAY        29\n     A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted\n     with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO\n     plays exercising MUSIC.\n     Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch-\n     ing exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki\n     waves him in. Unseen by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays\n     in the front of the door. He muscles his way in, the dog\n     never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank pushes\n     the door open. Frank looks the room over.\n                           FRANK\n              Unusual tactic for a guard dog,\n              but effective.\n     Nicki smiles, gesturing him in.\n                           NICKI\n              You can look around if you like.\n     Frank indicates it won't be necessary.   Nicki stops\n     working out.\n                           FRANK\n              I'm sorry to disturb you.\n                           NICKI\n              That's all right. It's an excuse\n              to rest. It's my private place.\n              I'm the only one who works out\n              around here.\n     Frank glances at photos on one wall. Most are of Nicki\n     from years ago; some show her performing with a band.\n\n                                                                     28.\n\n\n                           NICKI\n              My own ego wall.

We played high\n              school dances, stuff like that.\n              Then Rachel joined the act. As\n              you can imagine, she was quite a\n              little entertainer. Even then,\n              she had a way of stopping the show.\n              So I kind of quit. Professionally,\n              anyway.\n                           FRANK\n              You never went back?\n                           NICKI\n              It was pretty obvious who the\n              star in our family was.\n     Frank looks back at the picture.    Nicki smiles.\n\n30   EXT.

The\n     three doors of the garage start to rise in sequence.\n                           HENRY\n              I don't think there's anything\n              here you'd call a 'hint.'\n     One at a time the doors go up to reveal:\n     First garage -- the Cadillac limousine we've seen earlier.\n     License: RACHEL 2\n     Second garage -- a gray Mercedes.

No\n     other car in the world is this color. License: RACHEL 1\n     Frank looks at Henry, who is laughing and shakes his head.\n     He walks toward the Jag.\n\n     Frank releases the hood. He looks inside for a moment,\n     then reaches into the guts of the engine. He fiddles for\n     a second, then stands up holding some wires and slams the\n     hood shut again. He gestures toward the other two cars.\n                           FRANK\n              Get new plates for those two.\n\n\n31   EXT.

DRIVEWAY OF MARRON ESTATE - DAY                       32\n     Sitting beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the\n     limo in a 180 degree 'skid turn,' sending up clouds of\n     dust. A group of roadies watching bursts into spontan-\n     eous applause.\n\n33   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       33\n     Fletcher sits on the grass about halfway to the house,\n     watching the activity with delighted interest.\n     He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge.\n     FLETCHER'S POV\n     Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone fence. Across the\n     road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls\n     away. We can't see inside it.\n\n34   EXT. GATE AREA - DAY                                       34\n     One worker pries a small boulder out of a hole with a\n     crowbar. His partner picks up the rock and tosses it\n     on a small pile of rocks. The boulder bounces down the\n     backside of the pile.\n\n35   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                35\n     Rachel, looking out her window at Fletcher and the work-\n     men, sees the rock stop a yard from him. Fletcher\n     scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from a\n\n                                                                     30.\n\n     wave on a beach.   The sight disturbs Rachel.\n                             RACHEL\n              Fletcher!    C'mon. Back in here!\n     As she speaks, some workmen test the remote control on a\n     window shutter. It descends in front of Rachel's face.\n     She is not amused. Fletcher passes Frank on his way to\n     join Rachel. He mutters almost under his breath.\n                           FLETCHER\n              I think he's got a black 4 X 4. Could\n              be a Chevy. More like a Toyota.\n     Frank stares at Fletcher, then looks back to the street.\n\n\n36   INT. F.B.I. LOS ANGELES OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY     36\n     The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image\n     onto a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel's life.\n     We hear voices. One is Frank's; the other two belong\n     to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY MINELLA.\n     The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being\n     assembled earlier. It reads:\n              MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING\n              I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME IS COMING\n              WHEN YOU SHALL DIE...\n     Reading as fast as possible, we pick up some vicious\n     threats and obscenities, but we don't have time to read\n     it all before we...\n                                                CUT TO:\n     FRANK'S FACE\n     illuminated by the screen.\n                              COURT (O.S.)\n              This    is another of the ones we\n              think    are worth pursuing.

Sunlight streams\n     in. On Court's lapel is a tiny P.T. Boat pin.\n     Terry Minella, a slight, dark 35-year-old, offers Frank\n     a cigarette; Frank declines, Minella lights up.\n\n                           COURT\n              I sort of lost track of you after\n              Washington.\n                             FRANK\n              Yeah.\n                           COURT\n              How's the private stuff?\n                             FRANK\n                       (noncommittal)\n              Fine.\n                           COURT\n              Big money, I bet?

THE IVY - DAY                                         38\n     It's busy. Lots of customers arriving, leaving and\n     seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross the terrace. Near\n     the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a middle-aged\n     WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says\n     something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank.\n     Rachel whispers something to the Woman and they both\n     laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves toward the entrance.\n\n                                                                    33.\n\n                           WOMAN\n                     (an afterthought;\n                      phony)\n              Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.\n     Nicki waves and follows Rachel. Frank stays very close\n     without seeming to walk with Rachel.\n\n     A little girl darts into their path and approaches Rachel.\n     Rachel glances at Frank, who has stopped with her, then\n     she signs an autograph for the girl. The girl's mother,\n     close behind her, hands a small camera casually to Nicki\n     to be photographed as she and her daughter pose with\n     Rachel. Frank watches Nicki quietly comply.\n     Rachel, Spector and Frank all reach the front entrance\n     together, and Frank slips out first, glancing around.\n     Rachel comes out and passes within inches of him.\n                           RACHEL\n              I'm surprised you didn't plug them.\n\n39   EXT.

MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  43\n     As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a\n     glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to\n     accelerate.\n     As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license\n     number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end\n     of the property.\n     Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation.\n     CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a\n     steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can\n     be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.\n\n                                                                    36.\n\n\n     A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road\n     to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath,\n     Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The\n     4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner.\n     Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of\n     the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs\n     into a crouched upright position.\n     But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone.\n\n44   INT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  44\n     The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws,\n     install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches\n     over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV\n     KIT communications  system.\n                           FRANK\n              Keep this loose.\n     Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank,\n     expectantly.\n                           FLETCHER\n              Tell me about the car?\n                              FRANK\n              Toyota.

MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY                          45\n     Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the\n     hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where\n     she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a\n     Walkman.\n\n     There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from\n     the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells\n     toward the house.\n                           RACHEL\n              Shut up you assholes!\n\n\n46   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                46\n     A mild-looking OLD LOCKSMITH is working on Rachel's\n     window. Rachel walks in from the pool, starting to\n     peel off the swimsuit. She stops, startled, as she sees\n     him. This is the last straw. She blows up.\n                           RACHEL\n                     (clutching the\n                      swimsuit)\n              You! You! Out! Out!        Now!   Out\n              of here! Get out!\n     Terrified, the Old Locksmith drops his tools and begins\n     backing out of the room.\n                           OLD LOCKSMITH\n              Yes, ma'am. Thank you. I'm a real\n              fan of yours, Miss Marron.\n     Still angry, but disarmed, Rachel makes a face.\n                           RACHEL\n              Then you can take your tools with you.\n     She turns to the window, in what she imagines is\n     Frank's general direction, and, like a little girl,\n     suddenly sticks out her tongue.\n\n47   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - GATE/GUARD HOUSE - DAY                47\n     In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see\n     Devaney's immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it\n     roars up the drive. Frank, Henry and Fletcher watch in\n     the newly-erected guard house. The area is greatly\n     changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive\n     array of switches, lights and phones at his command.\n     There are several TV screens; one of them shows a series\n     of endlessly-panning shots from cameras at the rear of\n\n                                                                     38.\n\n     the grounds. On the other, the Mercedes kicks up dust\n     from the last few curves in the drive. Fletcher shakes\n     his head. He's seen it all before.\n                           HENRY\n              Is that Devaney?\n\n                           FLETCHER\n                     (to Frank)\n              She's got him by the short ones,\n              doesn't she, Frank?\n     Frank squelches a smile at Henry.   Where did he learn\n     that?\n                           FRANK\n              Yeah, she makes him nervous.\n     They watch as Devaney SCREECHES to a STOP, gets out and\n     hurries inside.\n\n48   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     48\n     Nicki is cutting fruit at the bar. Rachel, very tense,\n     is taking the fruit and dropping it into a yogurt drink\n     she's making in a blender.\n     Rory, her choreographer, stands behind her, massaging her\n     neck and shoulders. Spector is perched on a bar stool\n     like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki\n     gives him a look.\n                           RACHEL\n              I want him gone.\n                           DEVANEY\n              What is it now?\n                           NICKI\n              He told Rachel no Sunday brunch\n              at Charlie's.\n                           DEVANEY\n              No Sunday brunch.

Devaney walks\n     over to it.\n\n                                                         39.\n\n\n                      NICKI\n         On the patio.\n                      RACHEL\n         He's through messing with my life.\n\n                      DEVANEY\n         Rachel, I'm getting goddamn sick\n         of running up here every time he\n         steps on your toes.\n                (leaning out the\n                 glass door)\n         Farmer!

Rachel has difficulty keeping a straight\nface, too. Spector glares at them as Frank enters from\nthe sliding door.\n                      SPECTOR\n         You think that's funny? The\n         man talks to 20 million people\n         and he can't even get in here.\n                      FRANK\n         Did he have an appointment?\nDevaney turns to him.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Farmer, what is this about\n         brunch at Charlie's?

THRIFT SHOP - VALLEY - DAY                             48A\n      Rachel's limousine is parked opposite the shop.    It's\n      a decidedly downscale area. A little way  off, a   group\n      of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the limo   with\n      interest. Henry sits  at the wheel. Tony  stands   by the\n      open window, leaning against the car.\n\n                            HENRY\n                      (looking at the\n                       youths)\n               I wish Rachel didn't keep coming\n               here.

Let me try this on.\n      She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her.\n      She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing\n      booth, then stops dramatically.\n\n                                                            42.\n\n                      RACHEL\n                (to Frank, indicating\n                 the open booth)\n         Farmer, do you want to come in\n         here with me? Just to be safe?\nFrank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of\nthe shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the\ncurtain as she changes.\n                      RACHEL\n         You probably won't believe this,\n         but I have a reputation for being\n         a bitch.\nFrank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store-\nfront window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next\nto the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One\nof them is climbing onto the hood.\n                      RACHEL\n         I didn't used to be. But you get\n         known for being a certain way --\n         a way people think you are -- and\n         pretty soon you get like that.\n         Can't help it.\nFrank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices.\n                      RACHEL\n         You don't think so? You're such\n         an expert on famous people?\n                      FRANK\n         I've seen a few.\n                      RACHEL\n         And you disagree?\n                      FRANK\n                (very flat)\n         You can be as you choose to be.\n         It's an act of discipline\n         sometimes, but it can be done.\nRachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and\nlooks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the\nmirror is Frank.\n                      RACHEL\n         That why you never stay with one\n         of your clients? They too\n         undisciplined for you? Or is it\n         you're afraid you'll start to\n         care about them?\n\n                                                         43.\n\n                      FRANK\n                (without interest)\n         That's right.\nRachel turns to Frank.\n                      RACHEL\n         Can't you answer straight just\n         once?

I can't\n         keep up.\nFrank continues to search the shop and street with his\ngaze. Rachel steps closer to him.\n                      RACHEL\n         Look at me, Farmer!\nFrank turns and looks at her.\n                      RACHEL\n         You don't approve of me, do you?\n                      FRANK\n         Disapproval's a luxury I can't\n         afford.

Never mix business with\n         pleasure?\n                      FRANK\n         That's right.\nIt's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to\nan outfit on a rack just behind him.\n                      RACHEL\n         Grab that would you?\nFrank takes a beat.   Looks out the window.\n                      FRANK\n         I'm here to keep you alive... not\n         to help you shop.\nFuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself,\nwhipping the curtain shut behind her.\nA smile plays across Frank's face.\n\n                                                                     44.\n\n50   INT. DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT                       50\n     We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its\n     sleeve. The cover reads \"RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS.\"\n     The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video\n     player.\n\n     Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly,\n     intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO\n     the image, as if a little hypnotized by it.\n     ANGLE FRANK\n     Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV,\n     dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's\n     watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video\n     player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's,\n     tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on\n     the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases\n     are circled.\n     As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression.\n     It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first\n     time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to\n     be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable.\n     He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian\n     Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that\n     it holds, then looks back to the screen.\n\n51   EXT.

RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              52\n     The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty\n     apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls\n     on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed\n     for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her,\n     fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming\n     from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser\n     moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing\n     across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room\n     and hears her own voice singing out from there too.\n\n53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53\n     Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the\n     limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched\n     beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel,\n     dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from\n     the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a\n     videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where\n\n                                                          45.\n\nFrank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the\ndoorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves\nat Frank.\n                      FRANK\n                (to Henry)\n         I thought it was dinner.\n\nHenry shrugs.\n                      FRANK\n                (to Spector)\n         Are we going somewhere else?\n                      SPECTOR\n         The Mayan, Frank.\n\n                      FRANK\n         What's the Mayan?\nSpector starts to climb into the limo.\n                      SPECTOR\n         It's a club, Frank. Come on,\n         Henry, let's go.\n                      FRANK\n         Spector, you've got to tell me\n         about these things.\n                       SPECTOR\n         I just did.\nHe disappears inside the limo.\nRachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down,\nbrushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed.\n                      RACHEL\n         Nice suit, Frank.\nRachel is about to get in.\n                       FRANK\n         Rachel.\nHe removes something from his pocket, a small enameled\ncross.\n                      FRANK\n         I want you to keep this.\nRachel looks at it, both flattered and confused.\n                       RACHEL\n         For me?   It's beautiful.\n\n                                                                     46.\n\n                           FRANK\n              It's fitted with a radio\n              transmitter. When you close the\n              clasp, it sends a signal. If\n              there's ever a problem and we're\n              separated, just press it and I'll\n              know you need me.\n\n     Rachel doesn't know how to respond. She's stuck for\n     words. Spector pokes his head out impatiently.\n                           SPECTOR\n              Okay, she knows how it works,\n              let's get going.\n     Rachel manages a quick smile to Frank as she gets in the\n     back. Frank gets in the front beside Tony. The limo\n     pulls out.\n\n54   INT. LIMO - NIGHT (LATER)                                  54\n     Frank rides beside Tony in the front seat. The RADIO\n     PLAYS SOFTLY in the b.g. In back, Rachel, Spector and\n     Devaney are drinking champagne. Tony burps, smiles\n     at Frank.\n                           RADIO D.J. (V.O.)\n              You're listening to K.R.O.K., the\n              rock of L.A. and yes we have.\n                           (MORE)\n                           RADIO D.J.

(V.O.)\n              Rachel Marron, tonight, appearing\n              as Billy Thomas' very special\n              guest. But if you don't have a\n              ticket, you can forget going\n              down there. Police are asking\n              us to ask you to stay away. So\n              everybody, please stay cool,\n              stay tuned and we'll try to get\n              you some interviews after the\n              show. Remember, you heard it\n              here on K.R.O.K. -- the station\n              that delivers.\n     Frank looks back at Spector who silently mouths --\n\n                                                                       47.\n\n                           SPECTOR\n              It wasn't me.\n     The car turns a corner and there it is, The Mayan only\n     fifty yards ahead, a mob of fans spilling out of the\n     club, off the sidewalk and into the street.\n\n                              TONY\n              Fuckin' a.\n     Spector whoops with uncontrolled delight from the back of\n     the limo. Frank stares ahead in disbelief. The NOISE\n     of the CROWD can be heard as they pull up front.\n\n55   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       55\n\n     The mob reacts to the sight of the approaching limo which\n     turns into the parking area and heads for the backstage.\n     Faces of the fans are at the windows leering at Rachel.\n     Many are grotesquely painted. Some go into a wild frenzy\n     as Rachel's limo pulls up. There is a punch-up and a man\n     is beaten back. Someone has a video camera. Its quartz\n     light shines in through the limo windows. Everybody\n     squints at the glare.\n\n56   EXT. BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                              56\n     As Rachel's car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly\n     at the curb with blood streaming from his nose.\n     A pair of security guards try to hold them back.    As her\n     limo stops, a chant begins.\n                            CROWD\n              Rachel!   Rachel! We want Rachel!\n     Others join in as the mob presses forward.\n     The instant she exits the car, her expression goes public\n     -- a wide, show-biz smile. Sandwiched between Spector and\n     Devaney, with Tony in front and Frank at the rear, Rachel\n     makes her entrance.\n     A young man breaks the barrier   moving toward Rachel.\n     Frank grabs him by one of his   belt loops, gracefully\n     guides him all the way across   and slips him under the\n     opposite cordon into the arms   of a security guard.\n\n57   INT. RACHEL'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                          57\n     Rachel steps into a room set for a star's arrival.\n     Flowers are on every surface that will hold them. One\n     huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed on the\n\n                                                                     48.\n\n     floor. Frank checks them all with a magnometer wand\n     before letting Rachel sit down. He goes out, closing\n     the door, watchful.\n\n58   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                     58\n\n     Frank's eyes search the crush of people, milling around\n     outside the dressing room. A few feet away, Spector talks\n     to a JOURNALIST who's carrying a tape recorder.\n                           JOURNALIST\n              ... and this is my exclusive?\n                           SPECTOR\n              I swear I thought she'd talk to\n              you. Maybe later. What can I\n              say.\n     Frank is checked out by a strange-looking women in\n     Vampyra Drag.\n\n59   INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT                                 59\n     Rachel sits in front of the mirror putting on the silver\n     headpiece we saw earlier. She notices a small spray of\n     lilies-of-the-valley among the floral arrangements.\n     An envelope marked \"Rachel\" is attached to it. She\n     reaches forward and opens it.\n     We see the note as she unfolds it.\n              MARRON BITCH - YOU HAVE EVERYTHING\n              I HAVE NOTHING - PREPARE YOUR SOUL\n              FOR DEATH - THE TIME TO DIE IS...\n     We see the shock in her face.\n\n60   INT. STAR'S SUITE - NIGHT                                  60\n     Spector, Frank, and Devaney are there. Rachel seems\n     dazed, unfocussed. Devaney hands the note to Frank.\n                           DEVANEY\n              He sent another one.\n     Rachel immediately picks up on this.\n                           RACHEL\n              What do you mean 'another one'?\n     Frank quickly shoots a look at Spector.\n                           FRANK\n              They didn't tell you.\n\n                                      49.\n\n\n             RACHEL\nTell me what?\n             DEVANEY\nThere were some letters before,\nRachel... same kind of thing,\nthreats, oddball stuff...\n             SPECTOR\nWe didn't want to worry you...\n             DEVANEY\n... and somebody got into the\nhouse...\n\n             RACHEL\n       (starting to panic)\nSomeone was in my house?\n              SPECTOR\nOkay.   Let's not get hysterical...\n             FRANK\nLet's get her out of here.\n             RACHEL\nSomeone was in my house?\n             SPECTOR\nIt was weeks ago. You were out of\ntown...\n             RACHEL\nWhile Fletcher was there?\n             SPECTOR\nListen, Fletcher is okay. The\nhouse is like Fort Knox now.\nRight, Frank?\n             FRANK\nWe should get her out of here.\nRight now!\n             SPECTOR\nThere's no way anyone could...\n             RACHEL\nNo way anyone could what?\n             SPECTOR\nNo, wait... look everybody calm\ndown.

Frank\n     eases them out and gently closes the door.\n                           FRANK\n              I can't protect her out there.\n                           RACHEL\n              Do you think he's out there?\n     Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank.\n\n                           RACHEL\n              He's here, isn't he?\n                             FRANK\n              He might be.\n                           SPECTOR\n              We don't know that. Frank, we\n              don't know that.\n     Rachel is enraged.\n                           RACHEL\n              But you know he was in my house...\n              oh my God.\n                           DEVANEY\n              Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to\n              make an announcement.\n                           SPECTOR\n              Fine, you make it, they'll tear\n              the fucking place apart.\n\n61   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                        61\n     A lone mike stands onstage. The crowd's growing im-\n     patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins. Devaney walks\n     timidly onstage. He's not happy to be there. He reaches\n     the mike and taps it with a finger.\n                           DEVANEY\n              Excuse me... hello... I've got\n              an announcement to make. I'm\n              sorry but... due to circumstances\n              beyond...\n     Voices shout. \"Where's Rachel?\"... a groan begins.\n     A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands.\n\n                                                                    51.\n\n     More voices.\n\n62   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                    62\n     Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from\n     the audience begins. \"Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\" It\n     grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression\n     is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have\n     almost reached the exit, she stops.\n                              RACHEL\n              Wait...\n                           FRANK\n              Rachel... don't do it.    It's not\n              worth it...\n                           RACHEL\n                     (cutting him off)\n              No fucking freak is gonna chase me\n              off stage.\n     She pulls away from him.    Farmer starts after her, closely\n     followed by Spector.\n\n63   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                        63\n                           DEVANEY\n              I'm afraid that...\n     A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's\n     befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him.\n                           DEVANEY\n              Rachel won't be able...\n     Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back\n     to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his\n     direction.\n                           RACHEL\n              Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen,\n              thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone.\n              Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the\n              greatest. He's asked me to sing\n              a song. I hope you don't mind.\n     The crowd roars its approval.\n     Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves\n     along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking\n     obvious fear, she starts to sing.\n     As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers\n     tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety.\n\n                                                                   52.\n\n\n      ANGLE - RACHEL - SHOT FROM BEHIND\n      shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center-\n      stage.\n      Rachel snatches a quick glance at Frank then looks back\n      to her silent audience.\n      ANGLE - FRANK\n      He scans the audience intensely, face to face.\n\n63A   EXT. MAYAN - BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT                        63A\n\n      Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to\n      reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars.\n\n63B   INT. MAYAN - NIGHT                                         63B\n      Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming\n      ever stronger. Spector comes up to Frank in the wings,\n      positioning himself combatively between Frank and his\n      view of Rachel.\n                            SPECTOR\n               Are we having a communications problem\n               here?\n                            FRANK\n               What?\n      Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one\n      side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too.\n                            SPECTOR\n               Apparently, I didn't make it clear\n               to you how things go around here.\n                            FRANK\n               You told me you were going to\n               tell her. And you didn't.\n                            SPECTOR\n               I didn't think she could handle it.\n                            FRANK\n               But she handled it fine.\n      Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his\n      vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the\n      obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is\n      beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector\n      changes tack, becoming confidential, \"man-to-man.\"\n\n                                                                     53.\n\n                           SPECTOR\n              Look. Frank, I know what you're\n              saying. I know you want to do\n              what's best for her. I understand\n              that. You have a job to do here.\n              But you have to understand that\n              Rachel has a job to do too. And\n              that's what she's doing - out\n              there. She's working, Frank.\n              That's what she does and that's\n              where she does it. She's hot\n              right now. This is the time for\n              her. If she doesn't get out there,\n              she's dead. Forget about crazy\n              death threats, if she doesn't\n              sing, she's dead anyway... Look,\n              handled properly, this thing could\n              be good for a million dollars'\n              worth of free publicity.\n     Frank grabs him by the collar and slams him up against a\n     wall of curtain ropes.\n                           FRANK\n              One word.\n                           SPECTOR\n              It could clinch her the nomination.\n                           FRANK\n              One word in print about any of\n              this...\n     Spector nods, half-gasping. Frank tightens his grip.\n     Frank's attention is drawn by a renewed roar from the\n     crowd.\n                           SPECTOR\n              Trouble with you is you don't\n              understand the sympathy vote.\n\n64   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         64\n     Rachel scans the crowd, spread before her like a surreal\n     mural.\n     Camera flashbulbs explode like crazy through the glare.\n     The thundering adoration is like a stimulant. She darts\n     a look to Frank and gives him a fierce \"naughty girl\"\n     smile.\n                           RACHEL\n                     (turning back to\n                      crowd)\n              You like that? Would like to\n              hear another? Billy?\n\n                                                                     54.\n\n\n     From the wings, Billy Thomas gives her the nod to go for\n     it. It seems to be alright with everyone. The band\n     starts playing a dance beat.\n                           RACHEL\n                     (on the prowl)\n              I think my feet are trying to\n              tell me something... wanna see a\n              new video?\n     The crowd explodes. They know what song is coming.\n     They start to move with Rachel.\n                           RACHEL\n                     (dancing, talking)\n              I want to dance...\n     She skitters to the other side of the stage, baiting her\n     fans. Her new video explodes across the video wall\n     behind her. The crowd surges forward.\n     Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the\n     crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank\n     reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls\n     back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on\n     the other side. One of the guards darts out like a\n     ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and\n     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The\n     crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer,\n     trying to touch Rachel.\n     The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for\n     them to back off.\n     ANGLE - FRANK\n     Frank's task has suddenly become impossible. A forest of\n     hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone could be\n     the killer. Frank's eyes  dart over them all, his gaze\n     intense, as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.\n     RACHEL'S POV\n     Looking offstage at Frank. His frustration is almost\n     intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of the\n     stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank\n     starts forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back,\n     waving him off.\n\n65   INT. WINGS - NIGHT                                         65\n     Spector stands well out of Frank's reach, staring at Rachel\n     onstage. He catches Frank's attention, yelling back\n     defiantly.\n\n                                                                     55.\n\n                           SPECTOR\n              Look at her, fucking great.\n\n66   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                       66\n     Rachel dances erotically with the man -- bumping and\n     grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd roars\n     approval.\n     Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV\n     KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see\n     Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry\n     quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward\n     the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's\n     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her\n     gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending\n     to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri-\n     cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard\n     into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel.\n     She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of\n     the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans.\n     The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing\n     Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The\n     scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.\n\n     Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --\n     deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn\n     apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears\n     into the crowd.\n     CLOSE ON RACHEL\n     Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally\n     and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the\n     security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming\n     bodies out of the way. In the b.g., the video continues\n     on its serene, uninterrupted way.\n     FRANK'S POV\n     He spots a fire extinguisher in the wings.\n     BACK TO SCENE\n     Frank grabs it and heads to center stage. He aims the\n     extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the stage.\n     The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans.\n     Frank leaps onto the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young\n     blond man in the chest as he fights his way to Rachel,\n     taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank, knocks\n     a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.\n\n                                                                       56.\n\n                            FRANK\n               Tony, not there.\n                            TONY\n               I'll take care of this.\n     He heads for the door.\n\n                            TONY\n               Just follow me.\n     He turns and heads out to the sidewalk like a bull.\n\n67   EXT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                       67\n\n     Tony bursts out the front door and begins cutting a\n     swath through the crowd. Rain beats down.\n                            TONY\n               Make way here. Outta the way!\n     A burly street regular gets a shove from Tony and comes\n     back hard. The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells\n     encouragement.  But Tony is the better man and sends him\n     sprawling. The  rest of the way to the curb opens up.\n     At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and\n     turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.\n     A couple of people laugh.\n\n68   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                           68\n     Rachel and Frank emerge from the darkness between two\n     garbage bins and get into the limo Henry has waiting there.\n     The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly missing\n     Spector as he staggers out of the building.\n                           SPECTOR\n               Hey! What the fuck... Farmer!\n               Farmer! Come back here...\n     The limo skids around the corner and speeds off up the\n     street, leaving Spector in helpless fury -- apoplectic and\n     speechless.\n\n69   INT. LIMO - NIGHT                                            69\n     Frank turns and looks at Rachel.    She is diminutive,\n     doll-like, alone in the center of   the large limousine\n     seat. Her  hands rise to her face   and her body begins to\n     shake with sobs as she sits there   alone in the tattered\n     remains of her dress.\n     Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels\n\n                                                                     57.\n\n     uncomfortable.   Henry senses what is going on and\n     speaks softly.\n                           HENRY\n              Never done that before.\n                           FRANK\n              It's been a long night.\n\n70   INT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                     70\n     The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning\n     somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the\n     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the\n     riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking\n     for something.\n     Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment\n     of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand\n     picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the\n     sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet\n     move on.\n\n71   INT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  71\n     Fletcher is asleep in his bed. Frank waits as Rachel\n     glances in. Then she moves away. Opening the door to\n     her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.\n\n72   INT. RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 72\n     Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window\n     and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door.\n     All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he\n     approaches her she begins to tremble.\n     He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly\n     holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of\n     Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows.\n     Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are\n     shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does\n     it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and\n     not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked\n     still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her\n     gently into bed.\n     As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of\n     his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a\n     child's.\n                           RACHEL\n              Aren't you going to ask me why I\n              behave like that?\n\n                                                                    58.\n\n\n                            FRANK\n              I know why.\n\n73   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      73\n\n     Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care-\n     fully cutting and eating a peach.  The door at the other\n     end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking\n     wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he\n     is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast.\n     Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As\n     Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins\n     low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from\n     under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself\n     looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he\n     was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed\n     against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question-\n     ingly, as if to ask, \"Had enough?\"\n     Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony\n     stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony\n     throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank\n     ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and\n     throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks\n     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall.\n     He holds it in front of him threateningly.\n     Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks\n     up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in\n     his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same\n     fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony.\n     It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony\n     does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks\n     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances\n     at Tony.\n                           FRANK\n              I don't want to talk about this\n              again.\n\n74   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAWN                      74\n     Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate\n     house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man-\n     sion.\n     The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty.\n     We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being\n     covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns\n     sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit\n     and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him.\n\n                                                            59.\n\nThe suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her\nmanner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and\nvery girlish.\n                       RACHEL\n         Hey!   Gotcha, didn't I?\n\n                         FRANK\n         Hey.\n                      RACHEL\n         You're probably wondering what I'm\n         doing.\n                (as Frank nods)\n         You didn't know I jogged, did you?\n\nFrank shakes his head.\n                      RACHEL\n         What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll\n         get picked off in my snazzy running\n         suit?\n                     FRANK\n         No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog\n         with you.\nThey both smile.\n                        RACHEL\n         Great.    I guess I can't do it.\nRachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment,\nrests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She\nremoves it quickly.\n                      RACHEL\n         Will you walk with me a little?\nFrank nods and they cut off across the grounds.\n                      RACHEL\n                (hard for her)\n         I know this is kinda late, but\n         thank you. I'm really glad you're\n         here.\n                (she looks at him)\n         I'm going to try to cooperate.\n                      FRANK\n         That would be good.\nThey walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel\nfinally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself,\nnervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's\na terrific actress.\n\n                                                                   60.\n\n                           RACHEL\n              Farmer... I have this problem.\n              This minor little problem. You\n              see, I'd like to go out for an\n              evening. Just me and a guy. You\n              know...\n                     (makes a funny face)\n              ... like a 'date.' But I can't go\n              out on a date because you have to\n              be with me every minute. I mean,\n              what if he invited me up to his\n              place afterwards? Are you going\n              to come, too?\n                     (a beat)\n              So the only thing I can figure is\n              for you to take me out.\n                     (pause)\n              So... that's what I was wondering\n              ... you know. What do you think?\n              But only if you want to.\n     Frank is bemused.\n                           RACHEL\n              Only if you want to... I'm not so\n              bad...\n                     (looks at him)\n              God, this is embarrassing. I'm\n              gonna run up ahead there. You\n              decide.\n     She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above\n     them. He walks up after her.\n\n75   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - BALCONY - DAY                       75\n     Nicki is yelling from a window on the second floor of\n     the mansion. Fletcher peers out with her.\n                             NICKI (O.S.)\n              Rachel!    Sandy Harris is on the\n              phone!\n     Rachel and Frank look up.\n                           RACHEL\n              Tell her she'll have to wait,\n              babe. I'm getting fixed up here.\n     AT WINDOW - CLOSE ON NICKI\n     She watches Frank and Rachel, her expression neutral.\n     She turns away. Fletcher continues to watch his mother\n     with Frank.\n\n                                                                       61.\n\n76   INT. DAN-DEE CAR WASH-O-RAMA (L.A.) - WASH TUNNEL -          76\n     DAY\n     The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of the\n     tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through\n     the spinning brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers\n     as he waits for the limo to be cleaned.\n\n     Hands appear with a large chamois cloth, moving easily\n     and fast over the hood and windshield. A black in his\n     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car.\n     A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber\n     gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum\n     suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO,\n     loud. Loud enough to  hear over   the din outside the car.\n     The hose works its way over the   front seats.\n                           D.J. (V.O.)\n              ... And here's another biggie\n              from a lady very much in the news\n              these days, Miss Rachel Marron...\n     We see the owner of the hands. It is the young blond\n     man Frank kicked aside at the MAYAN. His name is DAN.\n     His face is impassive.\n                           D.J. (V.O.)\n              ... the hit song from the movie...\n              Queen Of The Night... I Have\n              Nothing.\n     The song begins and Rachel's voice fights the din. In\n     the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing\n     into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a\n     crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap\n     beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the\n     gloved hands retrieve the picture.\n\n77   INT. LOCKER ROOM - WASH-A-RAMA - DAY                         77\n     Tight, shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination\n     padlock to his locker and deposits the crumpled photo\n     inside.\n     As the hands remove the rubber gloves, the inside of the\n     locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of the locker\n     are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her\n     dancing with the word \"whore\" scrawled across it. Taped\n     to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a\n     holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the\n     MAYAN.

The technician is leaning over one of the\n     neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier.\n     With a scalpel, he lifts the word \"whore\" from out of the\n     message. He sets it on a white sheet, then brings the\n     blade back and scrapes at the residue of the dry glue on\n     the letter.\n     INSERT - B&W SHOT OF TOSHIRO MIFUNE WIELDING HIS SWORD,\n     CUTTING DOWN HIS ATTACKERS\n\n85   EXT.

The combination    goes a long\n     way toward disguising her. They pause at    one of the dis-\n     play windows.

Frank is a\n     surprisingly good dancer and is comfortable being this\n     close to her.\n     Rachel hums softly, picking up the words to the song.   As\n     we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her head.\n                           RACHEL\n              You like this?\n                              FRANK\n              Yeah.\n     A beat, then Rachel bursts out laughing.\n                            FRANK\n                      (reddening)\n              What?\n\n                                                                      66.\n\n                           RACHEL\n                     (trying to compose\n                      herself)\n              I'm sorry...

Rachel takes it off its mount carefully,\nunhooks the scabbard and begins to slide it off.\n                      FRANK\n         Watch yourself.\nRachel slides the scabbard off. The naked blade is\nbreathtaking. Rachel holds the sword out before her.\nShe walks toward Frank, then stops and looks over the\nblade at him.\n                      RACHEL\n         You're a hard one to figure, Frank\n         Farmer.\nHe stares at her.

He reaches out over the\n     blade to Rachel's neck and unties the silk scarf she is\n     wearing there. One hand draws the scarf away. The other\n     hand lingers for a moment on her neck, then lifts away.\n                            FRANK\n              Watch this.\n     He has raised the scarf over his head, in   the space\n     between them. With two hands he spreads    it out and then\n     lets it go. Slowly, billowing, the scarf    floats down\n     over the blade and is cut in two. These    two pieces float\n     slowly to the floor.\n     Frank takes Rachel's wrist and moves the sword away to\n     the side. They are both holding it as Rachel presses her\n     body against Frank's and they begin to kiss.\n\n90   INT.

Frank shuts his eyes in morti-\n     fication and pain.\n\n\n93   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - POOLSIDE - EARLY MORNING              93\n     A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering.\n     Frank is kneeling with Fletcher beside the pool. He's\n     putting new batteries into Fletcher's boat. Fletcher\n     watches him as he tears off the wrapping from the\n     batteries, much preoccupied.\n                              FLETCHER\n                        (watching him)\n                 She's real mad at you, isn't she?\n     Frank stops what he's doing and just looks blankly at the\n     batteries in his hands. There's a beat of silence.\n                              FLETCHER\n                 She told me she doesn't understand\n                 why you're so shitty to her...\n     Frank's shoulders droop and he lets out an imperceptible\n     sigh. He gently resumes fitting the batteries, still\n     not looking at Fletcher. In the quiet of early morning,\n     it's almost like a confessional.\n                              FRANK\n                 I've spent a lot of time learning\n                 not to react to things like other\n                 people do. It's my job. But it\n                 doesn't always work, Fletcher...\n                 it doesn't always work.\n                              FLETCHER\n                 I don't think I understand.\n                              FRANK\n                        (looks at him)\n                 I'm an old man compared to you,\n                 pal, and I don't understand either.\n                 And I'm starting to get the\n                 feeling I never will.\n     There's a crunch of footsteps behind him.       He looks\n     around.\n     With a big flourish, a copy of Daily Variety is put down\n     in front of us, front page upwards.\n                             NICKI (O.S.)\n                 Ta Da!\n\n                                                                    72.\n\n     Frank takes in that it's Nicki then glances at Variety,\n     lying on the concrete beside him. Splashed across the\n     top, the headlines announce the day's news of the\n     Academy Award nominations. Rachel's name is among the\n     Best Actress nominees. The Hollywood Reporter follows.\n     Frank picks up Variety and stares at it. Nicki stands\n     beside him with the morning's mail under her arm.\n\n                           NICKI\n                     (looking at him)\n              Thought you'd like to know.\n              Everyone said she was a sure thing.\n              Of course, you know all about that.\n     She raises an eyebrow, gives him a look. Frank looks\n     steadily back at her. She drops a small pile of mail\n     beside the magazines... several letters and a small\n     packet. She's embarrassed by Frank's gaze.\n                           NICKI\n              I'm sorry. That was out of line.\n              It's none of my business... Here's\n              today's question marks for you.\n     She turns and walks briskly back to the house. Frank\n     watches her go, then looks slowly down to the pile.\n     From across the pool, Fletcher watches silently, then\n     pushes his boat out into the deep water.\n\n94   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - JANITOR'S ROOM - DAY     94\n     Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon's\n     precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal\n     detector, sniffing at it.\n     It has been addressed in the normal way, except that\n     Rachel's name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted\n     above the address. He begins carefully slicing away the\n     wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box. The contents are\n     still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with\n     tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box\n     and movement in the paper. Frank drops the box into a\n     bed of sand in a sink surrounded by sandbags.\n     The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item --\n     it is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted\n     sign hung around its neck:\n                     WE LOVE YOU, RACHEL\n                     YOUR FANS IN BEAVER, PA.\n                     SALLY AND KATE.\n     The beaver's TEETH CLICK in Frank's hand.\n     We see Frank's face. This may just have taken years off\n     his life. He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,\n\n                                                                   73.\n\n     and looks at it.   No tremor.   Just checking.\n     Spector's voice suddenly shouts from the next door office.\n                            SPECTOR (O.S.)\n              Farmer!   Get in here!\n\n\n95   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY   95\n     The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and\n     flowers heralding the morning's news. Spector's secretary\n     is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the\n     b.g. Two assistants are struggling in through the door\n     with a large basketed floral arrangement.\n\n     Spector confronts Frank across his desk.\n                           SPECTOR\n              Put together a list of   your\n              expenses. Your total    billing...\n              Let me have it in one   hour and\n              I'll see that a check   is cut.\n                           FRANK\n              Don't you ever say what's on your\n              mind?\n     Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed --\n     especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in\n     their tracks and look.\n                           SPECTOR\n                     (almost shouts)\n              What's on my mind is that you're\n              fired, Frank. She missed all her\n              interviews yesterday because of\n              your little date. Do you realize\n              she stood up Barbara Walters?\n              First you fuck up her career...\n     Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and\n     Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They\n     also stop and listen.\n                           SPECTOR\n              ... and now you're fucking with\n              her head.\n                           FRANK\n              That's between us.\n                           SPECTOR\n              You think so? You forget who signs\n              your check. You don't understand\n              the role I play around here.\n\n                                                              74.\n\n                       FRANK\n         No.   I understand.\nSpector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on.\n                      SPECTOR\n         Get your shit together and be out\n         of here by noon.\n                        DEVANEY\n         Frank stays.\nSpector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have\nbeen listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of\nhis head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the\nroom. Devaney weighs in.\n\n                      DEVANEY\n         With this high a profile, Rachel\n         needs protection now more than\n         ever. If he goes, you can forget\n         Miami...\n                      SPECTOR\n         She's signed the fucking contract,\n         Bill. You want me to read it to\n         you?\nRachel is watching them both.\n                      DEVANEY\n         Fuck the contract. If he goes,\n         she's not singing a note. It's\n         too dangerous.\n                      SPECTOR\n         Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great.\n         Why don't you let Rachel speak for\n         herself? I think she has some say\n         in this.\n                      RACHEL\n                (flatly)\n         Frank stays.\nSpector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others.\nThe secretary interrupts from the back of the office.\n                      SECRETARY (O.S.)\n         Mr. Schiller calling on line one...\nSpector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney,\nRachel and Frank.\n                      SPECTOR\n         Well, I guess this is democracy in\n         action.\n\n                                                             75.\n\n\nRachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes\nher a \"little boy\" look.\n                     SPECTOR\n         I gave in. That's not easy for\n         me. Don't I get a hug?\n\nRachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the\nphone.\n                      SPECTOR\n                (into phone)\n         Yeah?... Sure, put him on...

Two uniformed security guards  are making a sweep\n     of the room with POLICE DOGS. Frank   checks the drawer of\n     a side table and then seals it with a  peel-off security\n     tape.  Thuringer is waiting near the  entrance hall.\n     Frank nods to him.\n                            FRANK\n              Okay.   Let's go.\n\n99   INT.

As the two men walk\n     along the corridor, the guest elevator opens and a\n     twelve-year-old boy in a bathing suit (MARK KATZ) steps\n     out, accompanied by his nanny. In the background, hotel\n     security men are checking fire-extinguishers and closets.\n                           THURINGER\n                     (to Frank)\n              The Katzes of St. Louis.

The camera crew hurries to\n      keep up with her.\n\n112   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                         112\n      This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on\n      chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as\n      far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the\n      presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a\n      whole new adrenaline level.\n      Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the\n      bodies displayed before her in words and expressions,\n      playing to the camera.\n                           RACHEL\n               Oh my God. Look what they're\n               wearing. Mother, hide your eyes...\n      Heads turn to look.\n                            RACHEL\n               I couldn't wear that suit... Honey,\n               you're naked... Of course, if I\n               had a body like that...\n      There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests.\n      She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests\n      throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is\n      among them.\n      People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run\n\n                                                            80.\n\nto get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are\nBROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and\nshoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon\nthe filming attempt.\n                     SPECTOR\n         Great, babe. They got what they\n         needed. Let's get back inside.\nFrank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently\neasing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in\nFrank's wake.\nRachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard\nappears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively.\n\n                      RACHEL\n                (to lifeguard)\n         You look like a man of good taste\n         to me. Come to my party tonight.\n                (to Schiller)\n         Ben, make sure this boy gets to\n         my party.\nSchiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he\ngets the point, and then she's off again. The throng\ngets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering\nher towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar\nchant starts up: \"Rachel, Rachel.\" It's starting to\nresemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,\namid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few\nbewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved\nforward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs\nand Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach\nhim. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd\nsurges again.\nAmid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel\ndrinks it all in.\n                      RACHEL\n                (over her shoulder)\n         Thank you. Thank you. Come\n         tonight and give till it hurts.\nWith a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his\nparty. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of\ndistorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks\non briskly.\n                      RACHEL\n                (to Spector)\n         I'm beginning to wonder about your\n         judgement, Sy. Why do I have to\n         keep paying my dues if I've\n         already arrived?\n\n                                                                      81.\n\n                             SPECTOR\n                       (very fast)\n                Kick me, beat me... whatever makes\n                you feel good. But let's not\n                pretend you don't like it. We're\n                too close for that. Whipping\n                people into a frenzy is why you\n                got into it in the first place.\n       Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec-\n       tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time\n       denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone\n       becomes almost soothing  --\n                             SPECTOR\n                And it's nothing to be ashamed of,\n                either, not for a second. It's a\n                gift... and only a handful are\n                given it. Many call but few are\n                answered.\n                             SPECTOR (CONT'D)\n                Don't fool with the blessing,\n                Rachel. The magic is sustained\n                through its use.\n                             RACHEL\n                Now you're going to tell me about\n                magic? Give it a rest will ya...\n                             SPECTOR\n                I'm done. Not another word...\n                       (a crooked smile)\n                ... I know you like to be reminded\n                sometimes.\n       Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job.\n\n113    INT. GRAND CENTRAL ROOM - ON STAGE - NIGHT                113\n       In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic.\n       She sings, as it was meant to be sung, \"I Have Nothing.\"\n       One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a\n       corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His\n       eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement.\n       All alone. Watching.\n\n113A   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - NIGHT                          113A\n       Fireworks explode over the water.\n\n                                                                     82.\n\n114   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  114\n      In the living room, the first night party is in full\n      swing. Crowded. Smoky. Noisy. Fireworks burst outside\n      the windows. People clap.\n      A mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party\n      dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black pianist is\n      playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters\n      work the room with platters of canapes.\n\n115   INT. RACHEL'S SUITE - OUTSIDE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT      115\n      Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand,\n      oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be-\n      hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses\n      at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and\n      grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank\n      catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The\n      lifeguard responds with a knowing smile.\n\n116   EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUITE - NIGHT                        116\n      Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all\n      guests are passing.\n      As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk\n      manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When\n      their names have been checked off a master list, they\n      walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No\n      one likes it, but they all do it.\n      Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The\n      handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright\n      lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media\n      event.\n      Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his\n      face.\n      A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is\n      cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN.\n\n117   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  117\n      Portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar. His\n      eyes scan the suite. His gaze settles on Frank checking\n      out the people who filter in. Portman appears next to\n      Frank.\n                            PORTMAN\n               Hello, Farmer.\n\n                                                           83.\n\n                      FRANK\n         Portman.\n                      PORTMAN\n         Buy you a drink?\n                      FRANK\n         Orange juice.

You working?\nRachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the\nlanding above the crowd, accepting applause. She has\nsucceeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She\nis a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his\nclient.\n                      PORTMAN\n                (impressed)\n         No kidding? I'd call that a step\n         up from the President.

Everybody's\n      high and happy. Conversation bubbles.\n      FRANK'S POV\n      Rachel leans into Portman; heads together, they whisper\n      intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief moment, turns\n      her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,\n      defiant. Portman does not see this.\n\n119   INT.

Someone's\n      horsing around, spraying champagne from a bottle over\n      everyone. A woman screams. Frank   bolts for the balcony.\n\n121   EXT. ON BALCONY - NIGHT                                           121\n\n      Rachel and Portman are poised precariously halfway over\n      the railing. Frank's hand shoots out, grabs Rachel's\n      wrist and tugs at the pair of them.\n      Portman regains his balance first and pulls Rachel back\n      from the edge.\n                            FRANK\n               What happened!\n                            PORTMAN\n               Somebody tripped.

Frank and Portman lock eyes. Portman\n      shrugs; he feels badly for Frank.\n\n122   INT.

He\n      looks in the mirror behind the bar and sees Rachel and\n      Portman in the hall outside her bedroom. She turns her\n      head to look directly at Frank's reflected face. Assured\n      that Frank is watching, she takes Portman's hand and leads\n      him into her room.\n\n      Frank sets his glass down and the bartender refills it\n      with orange juice. A stunning WOMAN IN GREEN glides down\n      the bar and stands very close to Frank.\n                            WOMAN IN GREEN\n               I've been watching you all night\n               from across the room.\n                            FRANK\n               Why don't you go back there and\n               keep watching?\n      Frank looks at Rachel's doorway, sipping his juice.\n\n123   INT.

The SURF sounds a STEADY BEAT.\n      It is peaceful and quiet. A relief.\n      On the Katz's balcony, forty feet away, little Mark Katz\n      is leaning against the railing, staring at Rachel's\n      suite.

RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              126\n      Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch.\n      Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back,\n\n                                                                   88.\n\n      catching herself.\n                            RACHEL\n               I'm not doing this.\n                            PORTMAN\n                      (still holding her)\n               I think you are.\n      She steps out of his embrace.\n                            RACHEL\n               I said I was grateful.   Thank you\n               and good night.\n      She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The\n      SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to\n      cross to the door.\n                            RACHEL\n                      (cool)\n               Please go now.\n      Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching\n      for her arm.\n      Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the\n      hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of\n      the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out\n      of Portman's grip.\n                            RACHEL\n               Mr. Portman was just leaving us,\n               Tony.\n      Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and,\n      with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back\n      to the party.\n      Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder\n      but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her\n      alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of\n      Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight\n      from the bottle.\n\n127   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       127\n      Frank looks out at the ocean.\n      ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES\n      OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to.\n      It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away.\n      Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from\n      everything in the suite behind him, in the world around\n      him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this\n\n                                                                     89.\n\n       one moment, his guard is down.\n\n127A   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                127A\n       A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out\n       of her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is\n       wearing sunglasses and a loose smock. It is noon of the\n       following day.\n\n130    INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - KITCHEN - DAY                    130\n       Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich.\n       Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a\n       place with breakfast. She is pouring orange juice as\n       Rachel walks in.\n       Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had\n       been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with\n       distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat.\n       Rachel looks at him.\n                               RACHEL\n                         (nasty)\n                  What the hell are you looking at?\n                         (pause)\n                  You probably never had a heavy\n                  night in your whole, goddamn\n                  disciplined life.\n       Frank looks at her, continues to eat.\n                               RACHEL\n                  You know, Farmer, you're a self-\n                  righteous son-of-a-bitch.\n       Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even\n       angrier.\n                               RACHEL\n                  Don't laugh at me, goddamit!

I\n                  didn't tell you to fuck everybody\n                  in the hotel!\n\n132    INT. CLEANING SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - DAY                       132\n       Special  Agents Court and Minella are watching the general\n       manager  of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge\n       canister  marked \"INDUSTRIAL DETERGENT.\" The general\n       manager  lifts the lid to reveal white powder.\n\n                                                                    90.\n\n      He talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse.\n      Court listens, nodding. Minella spoons some of the\n      powder into a plastic bag and seals it. OVER this we\n      hear Court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line.\n                              COURT (V.O.)\n                 It matches the traces in the glue,\n                 Frank.

He\n      walks toward the entrance to  the suite and is\n      immediately alarmed by what  he sees: there is no\n      uniformed guard by the front  door. He unlocks the\n      door and goes inside.\n\n135   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - ENTRANCE - DAY                    135\n      Frank comes in and looks around quickly.\n      FRANK'S POV - LIVING ROOM\n      Looking over living room, hallways, balcony.    No one in\n      sight. Nothing disturbed.\n      Devaney comes out of Rachel's bedroom, a panicked look\n      on his face.\n      BACK TO SCENE\n      They face each other across the gulf of the living\n      room.\n                             FRANK\n                Where is she?

Frank walks out onto\n      the balcony, looks round and down, comes back in. He\n      heads for the front door.\n                            DEVANEY\n               Where are you going?\n\n139   INT. SUITE - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY                             139\n      Frank is almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key\n      turns in the lock. Rachel and Tony come through the\n      door in high spirits, their arms full of shopping bags\n      and packages.\n      Frank stops dead and    watches. Rachel glances at him and\n      goes into the living    room. Tony looks at him meaning-\n      fully and follows.     Frank reflects for a moment, then\n      pulls the front door    closed, oh so gently.\n\n140   INT. SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               140\n      Rachel drops packages around and goes to the bar, pours\n      herself a drink. Tony takes some packages to Rachel's\n      bedroom.\n                            RACHEL\n               Hello, Devaney.\n                            DEVANEY\n               Rachel, where the hell have you\n               been?\n\n                                                                      92.\n\n                             RACHEL\n                Tony and I went over to Bal\n                Harbour.

Frank\n       watches near the entrance.\n\n                             DEVANEY\n                We were worried.\n                       (looks at Frank,\n                        talks to Rachel)\n                You know you're not supposed to do\n                that.\n       Frank and Rachel look at each other.\n\n                             RACHEL\n                Farmer, you work here!

Devaney looks at\n       him anxiously.\n                             DEVANEY\n                Farmer, where are you going?\n                             FRANK\n                I'm gonna check the route.    As\n                usual.\n       He opens the front door. A uniformed guard is standing\n       outside. Frank goes out and closes the door.\n                             RACHEL\n                Did Fletcher call?\n       Devaney, staring after Frank, shakes his head \"no.\"\n\n141    INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY                                  141\n       Frank's face shows the tension and the anger.    The ele-\n       vator descends.\n\n141A   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                           141A\n       Frank walks along the edge of the kitchen, looks over\n       the workers. A kitchen worker is in Frank's path. He\n       looks up, sees Frank's face and scurries out of his way.\n\n142    INT. BASEMENT - SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY                       142\n\n                                                                 93.\n\nFrank walks along checking the corridor.        At each door-\nway, he stops, looks inside.\nOne room is dark. He flicks on the light. Near the door\nis a pile of wooden crates, placed unnaturally out from\nthe wall.  Frank walks over and looks inside. They are\ndiscarded vegetable crates. Frank goes back to the door\nand yells toward the kitchen.\n                          FRANK\n            Gomez!   Louis Gomez!\nHe waits impatiently. No one comes. Two quick steps and\nhe is back at the CRATES, throwing them violently into\nthe corner where they CLATTER loudly to the floor. Frank\nwalks on along the corridor.\n\nHe stops, noticing something around the side.\nHe investigates.\nAn ENORMOUS CUBAN is sitting on some boxes in the\nshadows. He doesn't bat an eye when he sees Frank.\n                         FRANK\n            What are you doing?\n                         ENORMOUS CUBAN\n            Is none of you fuckin' business.\n                           FRANK\n            Move it.\nThe Enormous Cuban gets slowly up from the boxes.        He\ntowers over Frank.\n                         ENORMOUS CUBAN\n            Shove it up you ass, motherfucker.\nFrank has had   enough for one      afternoon. He hits the\nCuban low and   hard. The man       crumples forward, hurt,\nbut manages to   enfold Frank      in an awesome bear hug. His\nweight carries   them backward      in Frank's direction.\nThe Cuban continues      moving in that direction, but Frank\nis no longer in his      grasp. Instead, incredibly, Frank\nseems to have passed      through the man's body and flicked\nhim into the corner      of the stairwell.\nThe Cuban hits the wall hard. Jarred but not lost, he\ncomes up and out wielding a long mop as if it were a\nbaseball bat.\nFrank steps in and      under the man's long arms and hits him\nfour times around      the chest and jaw. Each of Frank's\nhands lands twice,      their movement is barely visible.\nThe solid THUDDING      tells the story. Frank strikes both\n\n                                                                    94.\n\n       the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands.\n       The Cuban goes down, stunned. Frank, his expression\n       fierce, is upon him immediately. Frank's arms entwine\n       the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. At the\n       end of the corridor, a woman screams.\n\n                       CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.)\n                Stop! Please. Don't hurt him.\n                Please stop!\n       Frank looks up. A hotel CLEANING WOMAN, carrying her\n       purse, is running towards them, tears already on her\n       face.\n                             CLEANING WOMAN\n                Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He\n                not up to nothing.\n       Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up. Dis-\n       gusted with himself. Breathing hard, he leans back\n       against the wall. The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees\n       and hugs her husband protectively.\n                              FRANK\n                I'm sorry.\n       Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to\n       collect himself.\n       He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes.\n       He looks up and sees a marquee.\n       RACHEL MARRON.

PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              146\n      Frank comes in the front door. He's had it. Devaney,\n      who has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out\n      a cigarette and stands to meet him. Frank doesn't pause.\n                            FRANK\n               I'm through. I'll get you back to\n               L.A. and that's it.

The bright  moon-\nlight illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is\nwearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has\nbeen brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But\ntonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She\nholds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This\nis the only time we've seen her smoke.\n                      RACHEL\n         Farmer... Nothing that's happened\n         between us matters... I understand\n         now... You're going to have to\n         believe me, because I'm not going\n         to beg.\n\nShe takes a long drag on her cigarette.\n                      RACHEL\n         It wasn't what he said... it was\n         the way he said it... he was so...\nHer voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose herself.\n                      RACHEL\n         I need you... I'm afraid... and I\n         hate it. I hate my fear...\n                (a beat)\n         Please protect me... Protect\n         Fletcher... If anything happened\n         to him...\nFrank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate\nstage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand.\n                      FRANK\n         I can't protect you like this.\n         It's impossible. The odds are on\n         his side.\n                      RACHEL\n         I'll do whatever you say.\nThis is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say\nthat. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean.\n                      FRANK\n         I want to take you away for\n         a while.\nRachel nods.\n                      FRANK\n         Somewhere people don't know about.\nShe nods again, agreeing.\n\n                                                                   97.\n\n\n                            FRANK\n               No Spector or Devaney or Tony.\n      He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation.\n      There is none.\n\n                            FRANK\n               If you cross me up this time, I'll\n               kill you myself.\n      Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief.\n\n148   EXT. HERB FARMER'S HOUSE (BEND, OREGON) - LAKE SIDE -      148\n      DAY\n\n      A large, old, two-story house sits at the top of a slight\n      rise, surrounded on three sides by thick, rolling woods.\n      Sloping gently down from the house to the lake fifty yards\n      away is a broad expanse of lawn.  Snow lies on the ground\n      and in the trees. At the edge of  the lake, a dock and\n      boathouse. An entrance road cuts  out of the trees.\n      A little TERRIER skitters to the edge of the drive\n      BARKING.\n      A van emerges from the trees, tires CRUNCHING through the\n      snow.\n      Frank's father, HERB, steps onto the front porch. He's\n      in his mid-60's, lean, tan and fit. He's wearing a plaid\n      shirt, jeans and cowboy boots.\n      The van stops in front of the house. Frank steps out\n      from the driver's seat and eyes his dad.\n                            FRANK\n               Lake's a little low.\n                            HERB\n               Fill up soon enough when she thaws.\n                      (glancing at the van)\n               They all in trouble?\n                               FRANK\n               Just one.\n\n149   INT.

Together, they\n      are happily playing around with the fluffy terrier.\n      Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face.\n      Henry brings the remaining luggage through. Rachel and\n      Nicki stand with Frank near the archway. All eyes are on\n\n                                                                      98.\n\n      Fletcher, Herb and the dog.

They don't\n               know who they're eating.\n\n\n150   INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                                 150\n      Herb stands beside a butcher block, cutting vegetables\n      for the evening meal with a practiced hand. Rachel\n      watches, drink in hand, looking around the kitchen. It\n      has been neatly organized.\n                            HERB\n               Katherine had this place organized\n               just the way she wanted it.\n                      (seeing her\n                       questioning look)\n               Frank's momma.\n      There's the COUGH and SPUTTER of an outboard MOTOR from\n      outside. Rachel looks from the kitchen window and sees\n      Fletcher and Frank in the small skiff by the dock.\n      Fletcher tugs again on the starter cord.       At the third\n      tug he tumbles backwards onto the seat.\n                            RACHEL\n               Fletcher doesn't swim well.\n                            HERB\n               I guess he'd better stay in the\n               boat then.\n                      (his smile puts\n                      her at ease)\n               Frank tells me you're a singer.\n                            RACHEL\n               That's right.\n                            HERB\n               I'm afraid we're a little out of\n               touch here.

He never got over that.\n                      (a long pause)\n               We buried Katherine that day.\n      Rachel looks out again at Frank and Fletcher in the boat.\n\n151   EXT. ON LAKE - SUNSET                                      151\n      Fletcher, Rachel and Frank are chugging across the golden\n      water in the skiff. Fletcher sits at the back, operating\n      the outboard, controlling the movements of the boat. He\n      wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher\n      locks the throttle into place and takes his hands off it\n      for a laughing moment with a \"Look, Mom, no hands\"\n      gesture.\n      Rachel looks to Frank and smiles, the wind blowing her\n      hair.\n      WIDE ON LAKE - DUSK\n      CAMERA is DOWN at water level by the lake's edge. In the\n      distance, the small boat skims across the surface. A\n      light mist is coming up.\n\n152   EXT. BOATHOUSE - DUSK                                      152\n      Henry helps Fletcher tie up the boat for the night.   It\n      is much foggier now and almost dark.\n                            FRANK\n               I don't want anyone going out in\n               it until you've checked it over\n               first. Okay? Every time.\n      Henry nods.\n\n                                                                   100.\n\n                             HENRY\n               Every time.\n                             FRANK\n               Every time.\n      In the distance, Rachel and Fletcher have just reached\n      the house where Nicki scoops up Fletcher and spins him\n      round and round in a circle. She hugs him close and\n      kisses his hair.  After a few moments, Fletcher squirms\n      free and runs to catch up with Rachel.\n\n153   INT. HALLWAY - LATER                                       153\n      Rachel, munching on a raw carrot, browses a row of family\n      photographs. The sounds of dinner being prepared come\n      from the kitchen.\n      We see the history of the family in the pictures; Frank\n      as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger Herb;\n      Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic\n      award; Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb\n      and Katherine Farmer, all dressed up and being introduced\n      to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the picture-perfect family home\n      in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers.\n      Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger,\n      talking to some female reporters. There standing\n      shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are Frank and Portman.\n      Portman's also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank is\n      in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel\n      looks at the two of them for a second.\n      Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange juice and a\n      drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a\n      moment as she studies the photo.\n      She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for several\n      seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.\n                            FRANK\n                      (inclining his head\n                       toward the photo)\n               Portman sometimes had trouble\n               remembering what his job was.\n               Supper's ready.\n      We can see from Rachel's face that she feels embarrassed\n      about her behavior in Miami.\n\n154   INT. DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        154\n      The meal has been enthusiastically consumed. Fletcher's\n      manhandling a chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs\n      and drippings. Rachel shakes her head, laughing.\n\n                                                                 101.\n\n\n                            HERB\n               ... And I never hit him.

When he's ten\n               years old, he complains about it?\n               Can you believe that?\n                            FRANK\n               Oh, for Chrissake! I'm going to\n               tell her about the time you\n               stripped in court.\n\n      Frank gets up smiling and takes some dishes into the kitchen.\n                            HERB\n                      (to Frank)\n               I don't care. I'm proud of that.\n                      (to Rachel)\n               Anyway, he's ten years old and\n               he's just started playing tackle\n               football. He comes to me and\n               tells me he's afraid of getting\n               hit, right? And he thinks it's\n               because I never hit him. 'Why don't\n               you ever hit me?' he says to me!\n\n155   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                    155\n      Frank puts down the dishes in the darkened kitchen.\n                            FRANK\n                      (back over his\n                       shoulder)\n               If you're lucky, maybe he'll\n               tell you about my first jockstrap.\n      As he speaks, he peers out through the window at the\n      lake. We hear Herb's voice continue from the other room.\n                            HERB (O.S.)\n               He got over it: Turned into a\n               helluva wide receiver. He\n               couldn't stand being afraid. When\n               he found something that scared\n               him, he'd just do it 'til the fear\n               went away.\n\n156   INT.

LIVING ROOM - LATER                                   157\n      Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a\n      cabinet and walks it  over to the table: A half-finished\n      game. He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending\n      a small cloud of dust  into the air.\n                            HERB\n               Come on, son, you can run but you\n               can't hide.\n      Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from\n      the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes\n      a place across from his dad by the fire. The others\n      gather round.\n                              HERB\n               Your move.\n      Frank studies the board.

Frank gestures for the\n      dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway\n      looking from one to the other.

Nicki tags along.\n                            NICKI\n               What's happening between you\n               and Rachel?\n      Frank glances at her.\n                            NICKI\n               Come on. One minute she's got\n               magnetic hands, the next she hates\n               you. I can't figure out what it\n               is now.\n                            FRANK\n               You follow all her moves this\n               closely?\n                            NICKI\n                      (smiling)\n               It's a living.\n                            FRANK\n               No, it isn't.\n      He moves away into the next room.    She hesitates a\n      moment, then follows.\n                            NICKI\n               You think my life is pretty\n               sickly, don't you?\n                              FRANK\n               No.\n                              NICKI\n               You must.

The kiss ends and they look at each other.\n                      FRANK\n         You're a lovely woman.\n                      NICKI\n         But you don't want me.\n\nFrank's look affirms it.    Nicki is embarrassed, angry.\n                      NICKI\n         I'm surprised. Thorough fellow\n         like you. Why stop at one sister\n         when you can fuck them both?\n                      FRANK\n         I make my mistakes.\n                      NICKI\n         But you didn't say no to the boss.\nShe starts to turn away from him, but his hands are on her\nnow, holding her close, refusing to let her turn away.\nTheir faces are very close.    It is tight and near here.\n                      FRANK\n                (with force)\n         No, don't go away, Nicki. Don't\n         leave me with that. Tell me about\n         it. Tell me how long you've been\n         second. Tell me how she has a\n         child and you don't. Tell me\n         something. But don't turn away\n         and try to stick it on me.\nNicki twists in his grip.    He holds her tight.\n                      NICKI\n         I don't need this from you.\n                      FRANK\n         Maybe I need it.     I'm fed up with\n         people telling me    they have no\n         control over their    lives. If you\n         hate your life so    much, turn it\n         around.\n\n                                                                     106.\n\n                             NICKI\n                It's not so simple.\n                             FRANK\n                Yes it is. You can walk out that\n                fucking door anytime you want.\n                I'll unlock it for you.\n\n       Nicki looks up into his face.    Tears start in her eyes.\n                               NICKI\n                Let me go.\n       He releases her, looks at her.\n                                FRANK\n                Okay.     It's not my business.\n       He moves away, OUT OF FRAME.    We HOLD ON Nicki, a long\n       time.\n\n162    EXT. LAKE - DAY                                             162\n       Bright sun.

PORCH - DAY                                            162A\n       Nicki absently sings an old gospel tune as she tosses\n       breakfast scraps to a group of hungry ducks gathered by\n       the porch.\n\n162B   EXT.

Both sing for a\n       moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel\n       gives her a hug.\n\n                                                                    107.\n\n\n162D   EXT. LAKE - DAY                                            162D\n       Herb and Frank are about to return to the house. They\n       stop short. There, at their feet, is a line of human\n       foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into\n       the trees. Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert.\n\n                              FRANK\n                 Where's Fletcher?\n       Henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a\n       fishing rod as he comes out. At that instant, the sound\n       of the OUTBOARD MOTOR CRACKLES through the air. Frank's\n       head snaps toward the boathouse. Henry, in the distance,\n       looks quickly at the boathouse, then to Frank.\n\n                             HENRY\n                       (shouting)\n                 Frank! I haven't...\n       But Frank is already moving, leaping from the porch\n       and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse\n       and dock.\n       Rachel turns to look.\n       The skiff appears out of the boathouse, Fletcher at the\n       motor, the boat's lone occupant. The boat moves slowly\n       away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock.\n       Frank is running toward the water with everything he's\n       got, his face contorted. The sound of the OUTBOARD\n       drowns out his voice as he yells.\n                               FRANK\n                 Fletcher!   Fletcher!\n       IN BOAT\n       Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees\n       Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is\n       approaching the end of the dock.\n       DOCK\n       Frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to\n       sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards\n       as he runs.\n       IN BOAT\n       Fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the\n       throttle a little twist.\n       DOCK\n\n                                                             108.\n\nFrank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives\ndirectly at the rear of the moving boat. Frank's body\nflies out over the boat. He knocks Fletcher out of his\nseat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.\n                         RACHEL\n                   (screams)\n           No!   He can't swim!\nIN WATER\nFrank holds the terrified, shaking Fletcher in his arms.\nFletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him toward\nthe dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out\ntoward the center of the lake.\n\nDOCK\nHenry and Rachel are already    at the end of the dock. Nicki\nand Herb are running toward    it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.\nHenry peers out at the boat,    which continues to bounce\ninnocently across the water,    defining a broad curve.\n                        RACHEL\n           Fletcher, baby. Are you all\n           right? Baby.\nFletcher, spluttering, is handed up to Rachel by Frank.\nRachel hugs Fletcher to her. Herb bends down to check\nhe's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.\n                        HERB\n           He's all right.\nHenry helps Frank up out of the water.    Frank sits on\nthe end of the dock, breathing hard.\n                        RACHEL\n           What are you doing? You out of\n           your mind? You're crazy!\n                  (to Fletcher)\n           You're all right, baby.\n                  (back to Frank)\n           You could have drowned him!\nFrank and Henry look out toward the boat which has come\nto a stop out in the middle of the lake.\n                         FRANK\n           I'm sorry.   I got careless.\nHenry looks at Frank.    He feels terrible about not\nchecking the boat.\n                        HENRY\n           Frank, I'm sorry. I should have...\n\n                                                                     109.\n\n                             HERB\n                It's okay, Henry.\n       Herb puts his hand on Fletcher's head.\n                             HERB\n                You all right now, son?\n\n       Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.   Frank begins\n       to stand up.\n                             HENRY\n                How do we get the boat back?\n       Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.    Every-\n       one on the dock jumps.\n\n       Nicki screams.\n       Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an\n       impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.   It's\n       trembling slightly.\n\n162E   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                          162E\n       Rachel and Nicki hurriedly pack their bags.   Fletcher\n       hovers nearby.\n\n162F   EXT. SHED/GARAGE - DAY\n       162F\n       Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up.\n       Henry stands nearby.

Till it's done.\n                      FRANK\n         He keeps going until he kills her?\nNicki nods again, lowering her face into her hands.\n                      FRANK\n         What's the name of the bar?\n                      NICKI\n         I'm not sure... I was very stoned.\n                      FRANK\n         How 'bout the letters?\n\n                                                                  113.\n\n\n                            NICKI\n                      (desperately)\n               No, no. You don't understand.\n               The letters came first. I don't\n               know who's sending them... but\n               they're reading my mind... Those\n               were my thoughts. I hate her. It\n               made me think I could do it... But\n               I could never hurt Fletcher.\n               Never.\n                      (begging him)\n               You've got to stop it!\n                            FRANK\n               We will. You and me. Tomorrow\n               we're going back to L.A. We're\n               going to find the bar, we're going\n               to find Armando.\n      He starts to rise.    She stops him.\n                            NICKI\n               Don't you even want to know why?\n                               FRANK\n               You told me.     She has everything.\n      Frank stands up and begins to move across the room. Nicki\n      puts her face in her hands and is silent for one moment.\n      Suddenly, Frank freezes, listening.\n                            NICKI\n               What if we can't --\n      Frank motions her into silence. We strain to hear what\n      Frank hears. Silently, Frank goes to the door, crouch\n      ing. He listens. There again is a DISTANT GROWL from\n      the DOG upstairs.\n      Frank lifts his gun from the table, turns to Nicki.\n                              FRANK\n               Stay here.    Don't move.\n      Nicki's face shows true terror.\n      Frank is out the door.\n\n168   INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                      168\n      Frank runs up them fast.    Two at a time.\n\n169   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT                           169\n\n                                                                      114.\n\n       Frank travels close to the wall, very quickly. He stops,\n       listens. The TERRIER looks at Frank but still GROWLS.\n       Frank throws open Rachel's door. Rachel gasps in\n       surprise and clutches at Fletcher. Frank hears a noise\n       behind him, whirls round him and drops to a knee, weapon\n       ready to fire!\n\n       It's Herb, stepping out of his room, carrying a police-\n       issue pistol.\n                             HERB\n                It's me!\n       Rachel's voice comes from her room.\n                             RACHEL (O.S.)\n                What's happening?\n       The terrier suddenly starts barking loudly.\n\n171    INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - POV - MOVING SHOT - NIGHT         171\n       We're in someone's POV moving along the hallway. Nicki\n       steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in\n       terror toward the CAMERA.\n                             NICKI (O.S.)\n                No, no... stop... I'm the one\n                who...\n\n172    INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172\n       Frank and Herb spin around.    Rachel calls from her room.\n                             RACHEL\n                Frank?\n\n172A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                             172A\n       A GUNSHOT BLASTS Nicki against the wall, her hand still\n       delicately raised in a classic gesture of restraint.\n\n172B   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172B\n       Frank's head spins to Rachel's doorway, then immediately\n       back to Herb. He starts to move towards the stairs,\n       fast.\n                             FRANK\n                       (to Herb)\n                Stay with Rachel!\n       Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room.\n\n                                                                    115.\n\n\n\n173    INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                        173\n       Frank is rapidly down the stairs, gun in hand.\n\n\n173A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                           173A\n       Frank finds Nicki's body slumped against the wall.   He\n       checks her. She's dead. The door beyond is open.     The\n       wind blows in. Outside it's foggy.\n                             FRANK\n                       (yelling)\n                Dad?\n\n                              HERB (O.S.)\n                We're okay!\n                             FRANK\n                Stay with Rachel!\n       The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight\n       movement outside and window to his right. A split-second\n       moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall,\n       away from the open door.\n\n175    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175\n       The fog is thick. Frank swiftly emerges from the back\n       door and stops, dead still, listening. There is only the\n       RUSTLING of TREES.\n\n175A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              175A\n       Herb is by Rachel's bed.\n                             RACHEL\n                What's happening? Where's Nicki?\n                              HERB\n                Be quiet!\n\n175B   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175B\n       Frank listens. Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a\n       body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off\n       towards the sound at a run.\n\n176    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176\n       INTERCUT - FRANK AND FIGURE\n\n                                                                    116.\n\n\n       The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene.\n       In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,  wait, go. Two\n       wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into\n       the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving\n       faster, closing the gap.\n\n       The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-\n       ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of\n       the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He\n       hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the\n       direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE.\n       Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he\n       hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up\n       ahead. Close.\n\n       The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready,\n       confident. He waits. Nothing.\n       Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He\n       raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready\n       to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something\n       really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we\n       hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun\n       15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.\n       The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered\n       six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind\n       his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in\n       the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER\n       SHOT from Frank very close to the man.\n\n176A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              176A\n       Herb is at the window. There is anguish on his face as\n       he hears the SHOTS. He wants to go to his son's aid but\n       knows he cannot leave Rachel.\n       Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified.\n       Fletcher clutches at the DOG, which is still BARKING.\n       Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand.\n\n176B   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176B\n       Frank moves quickly through the woods, passes the\n       splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear the ENGINE\n       of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt.\n       Frank breaks out of the woods in time to see the red\n       lights at the back of the car as it fishtails around a\n       bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear GLASS\n       SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.\n\n176C   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING            176C\n\n                                                                  117.\n\n\n       Snow is falling. In the b.g. we see the flashing\n       lights of a police car. Frank is on the phone to\n       Minella.\n                             MINELLA (V.O.)\n                But, Frank, this doesn't make\n                sense...\n                             FRANK\n                What do you mean?\n                             MINELLA (V.O.)\n                We already got him.\n                              FRANK\n                What?   Where?\n\n179    INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS (LOS ANGELES) - EARLY MORNING   179\n       Minella is talking with Frank on the phone. He's looking\n       into an observation room through a one-way window.\n                             MINELLA\n                Here, last night. You should see\n                his locker, Frank. The guy's\n                obsessed with Rachel Marron...\n                             FRANK\n                You're sure it's him?\n                             MINELLA\n                Forensics say it's 100 percent\n                positive I.D...

He looks frightened and confused.\n\n179A   INT. PHONE BOOTH - COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING          179A\n                             FRANK\n                Well, whoever you got down there\n                wasn't here last night. This was\n                a professional...\n                             MINELLA (V.O.)\n                This is crazy... What do you want\n                to do, Frank?\n                             FRANK\n                How long can you keep him?\n\n                                                                   118.\n\n\n                            MINELLA (V.O.)\n               Well technically all he's done is\n               write some letters. 48 hours\n               maximum. You know the deal.\n\n\n181   EXT. MARRON MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAY                       181\n      Rachel's black limousine moves slowly up the winding\n      drive, followed by a black Mercedes limousine. Behind\n      the cars, the gates close on a large press contingent\n      gathered outside, held back by a large number of police\n      and security guards. A light drizzle is falling.\n      The two cars pull up to the entrance, Henry at the wheel\n      of Rachel's. Frank gets out of the front and opens the\n      back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and Fletcher\n      out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few\n      other mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes.\n      Rachel, red-eyed and weary, takes Fletcher under her arm\n      and goes inside. She does not look at Frank.\n\n182   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   182\n      A hand takes a pitcher of orange juice from the refriger-\n      ator and pours some into a large glass. They uncap a\n      bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into the orange\n      juice.\n\n183   INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                                   183\n      It has grown very dark in the family room. Frank is\n      sitting all alone, perfectly still, in one of the over-\n      stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to him.\n      He stares off into space. A small voice comes out of\n      the darkness.\n                            FLETCHER\n               You okay, Frank?\n      Frank acknowledges Fletcher's small presence standing\n      to the side of the big chair. He doesn't look at him\n      directly.\n                            FRANK\n               Yeah, Fletcher, I'm okay.     How\n               'bout you?\n                            FLETCHER\n               I couldn't sleep... It was so\n               scary, just thinking about it...\n      He looks at Frank.\n\n                                                                    119.\n\n\n                            FLETCHER\n               Do you feel scared, Frank?\n                            FRANK\n               Yeah, Fletcher, I do.\n\n      Frank puts his hand gently on Fletcher's head, but he\n      does not look at him.\n                            FRANK\n               Everybody's afraid of something,\n               Flethcer. That's how we know we\n               care about something, when we're\n               afraid we'll lose it.\n\n                            FLETCHER\n               What are you afraid of?\n                            FRANK\n               I think you should try to go back\n               to sleep now, pal.\n                            FLETCHER\n               Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the\n               man who killed Nicki? Are you\n               afraid of him?\n      Finally, Frank turns and looks at Fletcher.    Frank is\n      pretty far gone. He shakes his head \"no.\"     He realizes\n      that that kind of fear had never occurred to   him, and\n      recognizing that fact sets him back into his   thoughts.\n                              FLETCHER\n               Then what?    What are you afraid\n               of?\n      Frank doesn't have the will to resist anymore.    He lets\n      his hand drop away from Fletcher.\n                            FRANK\n               I'm afraid... of not being there...\n      Fletcher stares at him, uncomprehending.\n                            FRANK\n               It's late. Do you want me to take\n               you back to your room?\n      Fletcher shakes his head \"no,\" just barely.    Then he\n      disappears.\n\n185   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                        185\n      Frank, silhouetted, moves toward the stairway to the main\n      level. There is light up there.\n\n                                                                  120.\n\n\n\n186   INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT                                    186\n      Frank begins climbing the stairs. When he has gone a\n      quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at the top and\n      begins walking down.\n\n      At first she doesn't see Frank; when she does she\n      hesitates a moment, then continues down. They meet and\n      try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the\n      same direction, unable to get around. Rachel, already\n      emotionally ravaged, cracks. She begins slapping Frank\n      hard about the face and torso. One of the first blows\n      knocks the GLASS from his hand; it SMASHES loudly against\n      the wall.

Fletcher is splashing noisily in\n       the pool with a few other kids. His nanny waits\n       patiently at the side, towels at the ready.\n       At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought,\n       mourning her sister.\n       At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too,\n       is trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears\n       some of the responsibility.\n\n       The SHOUTS and LAUGHTER of the kids continue.\n\n187    EXT.

He gazes down at the gate-\n       house, his face lit softly by   the glow from its lamps.\n       All around him the rest of the   estate is quiet and\n       tranquil in the moonlight.\n       After a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap-\n       proaches and stands beside him.

The audience applauds.\n      Beside the monitor, a large clock with a ticking second\n      hand.\n      A harried associate producer SKIP THOMAS, comes up to\n      Rachel, settled in an armchair.

Portman's body slumps forward in\n      her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His\n      pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.\n      ON STAGE\n      Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He\n      half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's\n      unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her.\n      Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears\n      streaming down her cheeks.\n\n                                                                    146.\n\n      Frank Farmer's face. Sad and weary. His guard is\n      finally down. Nothing more can happen. He slowly lowers\n      the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his\n      chest.\n\n      ANGLE ON SPECTOR\n\n      In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men,\n      police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves\n      the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name.\n      There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe\n      them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket.\n\n220   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                          220\n\n      A chaos of press and public, ambulance and police lights\n      flashing, SIRENS WAILING.\n      ANGLE ON PART OF CROWD\n      Police and paramedics surrounding a man on a stretcher --\n      it is Frank -- Rachel walks at his side, clutching his\n      hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a dressing\n      over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among\n      the gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan,\n      pushed back to the sidelines and unable to see what is\n      happening. He slowly turns and walks away. CAMERA\n      CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.\n\n221   EXT. AIRPLANE TARMAC - DAY                                 221\n      A buffed-out charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as\n      the last pieces of equipment of Rachel's band are loaded\n      aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up and Rachel\n      gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as\n      her bodyguard.\n      She greets some members of the band and others who will\n      be part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage\n      removed from the limo and loaded aboard the plane.\n      Devaney is trying to hurry her on board. Spector is\n      conspicuous by his absence.\n      As Rachel and the others prepare to get onto the plane,\n      Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to\n      something O.S.\n      Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is\n      pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is\n      still taped. He smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes\n      a quick abrazo.\n                             FRANK\n                       (indicating eyepatch)\n                How's it going?\n\n                                                           147.\n\n\n\n                      TONY\n         Under control. But it won't be\n         the same... ya mutt.\nTony fakes a glancing blow to Frank's chin. Over by the\nplane, Fletcher spots Frank and tugs at Rachel's dress,\ntill she turns to look. Fletcher runs up to Frank and\nhugs him around the knees. Rachel approaches and Tony\nmoves back toward the plane.\nDevaney waves in Frank's direction, tapping his watch to\nindicate they are late. Frank waves and smiles.\nRachel's surprised to see Frank, but clearly happy.\nFletcher is ecstatic.\n                      RACHEL\n         You shouldn't be here.\nFrank laughs.    There is a pause.\n                      RACHEL\n         So, you're quitting show business?\n                        FRANK\n         Yeah.\n                      RACHEL\n         Too bad.

Rachel starts to cry.\n                      FRANK\n         So, how's the new guy?\n                      RACHEL\n         He's got white hair, Frank.\n\n                                                                    148.\n\n\n\n                            FRANK\n               He's very good.\n                            RACHEL\n               Why'd you have to get me an old\n               man?\n                            FRANK\n               I don't trust you.\n                            RACHEL\n               Yeah... well, give me a kiss and\n               let's get this over with.\n\n      Frank gives her an awkward hug.   They kiss.\n                              FRANK\n               'Bye Rachel.\n      Rachel turns quickly. She almost runs up the boarding\n      ladder. Frank remains watching her. Fletcher looks back\n      over his shoulder as they disappear into the plane.\n\n222   INT. PLANE - DAY                                            222\n      Rachel takes a seat beside Fletcher.

They embrace and kiss. They kiss again and again.\nFinally, slowly, Rachel draws back, her eyes are filled\nwith tears.\n                        RACHEL\n           Remember when you said you'd risk\n           your life for me?\nFrank tries to break in, but she won't let him interrupt.\n\n                        RACHEL\n           I didn't really believe it then.\n           Nobody means what they say. But\n           you did, Frank. You did it.

I don't\n           want to hear any bullshit about\n           you just doing your job. You did\n           more than save my life, Frank.\n           You showed me a way to be.

Thank you... Now I\n               want to sing you an old song, but\n               it's a new favorite.\n      As the music begins, Rachel stands alone in front of the\n      band, mike in hand.\n\n                            RACHEL\n               You know, this song used to make\n               me feel sad...

This is for him.\n      Rachel begins to sing the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE\n      BROKEN HEARTED' - slow and sweet.\n      It's the song she and Frank danced to.
