There is the sound of\n    a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies.\n    THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from\n    another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish-\n    able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete\n    walls and dies away. Silence.\n<b>    SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN:\n</b>\n<b>1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1\n</b>\n<b>    FRANK FARMER'S FACE -\n</b>    mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He\n    is The Bodyguard.\n<b>    ANGLE - HIT MAN\n</b>    dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops\n    heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly\n    down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face\n    down on the  cement floor.\n    A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of\n    KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the\n    filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome,\n    50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear\n    as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There\n    is no movement.\n    The two men are lying near the right front fender of a\n    black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit\n    man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself\n    up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still\n    alert for any further threat.\n<b>    MAIN TITLES BEGIN.\n</b>    A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.

It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness.\n\n<b>2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2\n</b>\n     Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom.\n     Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all\n     the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering\n     image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman\n     as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the\n     image until it is almost broken up into its scanning\n     lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her\n     song \"I have Nothing.\"\n\n\n<b>2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A\n</b>     A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile\n     of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of\n     magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control,\n     softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw\n     in the store window, the same song.\n     Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove\n     a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the\n     gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.\n     The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars.\n     They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A\n     headline on the cover reads: \"RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST\n     TRIUMPH!\" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they\n     excise the name \"RACHEL MARRON\" from the page. With the\n     care of a surgeon.\n\n<b>3    EXT. HOLLYWOOD PREMIERE - NIGHT                            3\n</b>     A tumultuous crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms\n     stretch out, cameras flash, sunguns flare, microphones\n     are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of \"Rachel!\n     Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way,\n     Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\" We cannot see the object of\n     this frenzy. We catch a brief glimpse of an attractive,\n     well-dressed young woman (NICKI), exiting with the other\n     celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside\n     by the mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm\n     and impassive as she watches from the sidelines.\n\n<b>5    INT. KLINGMAN'S OFFICE DEN - NIGHT                         5\n</b>     In a paneled room tastefully hung with a few choice paint-\n     ings that reflect Klingman's success as an arbitrageur,\n     he pours two snifters of brandy as he speaks with Farmer.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                   3.\n</b>\n<b>                          KLINGMAN\n</b>             Your hands ever shake, Frank?\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>             Sometimes.   It's just adrenaline.\n<b>                          KLINGMAN\n</b>             ... How did you know?\n<b>                          FRANK\n</b>             I saw him washing the car.\n<b>                          KLINGMAN\n</b>             I saw him.\n<b>                          FRANK\n</b>             They don't wash cars on the\n             parking levels.\n    He hands a glass of brandy to Frank, who looks at it.\n<b>                          KLINGMAN\n</b>             You know, I'd like you to stay on.\n    He passes a small sealed envelope to Frank.\n<b>                          FRANK\n</b>             I'm not good in permanent\n             positions, my feet go to sleep.\n    The two men smile at each other. They raise their glasses\n    in a joint salutation -- Klingman drinks. Frank doesn't.\n\n<b>6   INT. DARKENED ROOM - DESK TOP - NIGHT                      6\n</b>    The rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word \"TIME\" onto\n    a message that is taking the classic form of a ransom\n    note. Each word has been cut from a different page and\n    is in a different typeface. The note is being assembled\n    with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance\n    and is quite easy to read. It reads:\n<b>             MARRON BITCH -- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING\n</b><b>             I HAVE NOTHING. THE TIME TO DIE IS ...\n</b>\n<b>7   EXT. CHARITY CONCERT - EVENING                             7\n</b>    A blur of hands and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper,\n    autograph books, notes are thrust forward INTO the CAMERA.\n    Again, a mass chanting \"Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!\"\n    Hands of Rachel's entourage accept some of the proffered\n    items.\n    In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel's hands signing \"Best wishes,\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                                     4.\n</b>\n     Rachel Marron\" on an out-stretched open palm. In the\n     midst of the urgent forest of hands and paper, a be-\n     ribboned black doll is thrust forward, bearing the legend\n<b>     \"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU.\"\n</b>\n<b>8    EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - EVENING                        8\n</b>\n     SLAM of a CAR DOOR. Frank gets out of a cab with two\n     suitcases. His house is a modest stucco affair on a\n     small lot. He goes up the walk and puts down his suit-\n     cases. He looks at rampant foliage and overgrown grass.\n     Supermarket circulars cover his doorstep. He picks up a\n     few and fishes a bunch of keys from his pocket. A\n     curious neighbor peers from behind a net curtain. As the\n     door opens, we are aware of a further pile of mail\n     inside. Frank's feet push the letters aside and go\n     inside. The door shuts.\n\n<b>10   INT. FARMER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                              10\n</b>     Farmer has carefully set a place for himself at the table\n     in a breakfast nook. A bottle of red wine is open with a\n     glass beside it.\n     At the stove he stirs and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and\n     reads a Time magazine. He adds a splash of wine. He\n     lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of meat.\n     At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently\n     eats another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on\n     the plate and eats from it directly while glancing\n     through the magazine.\n\n<b>11   INT. DRESSING ROOM - CLOSEUP - CORNER OF DRESSING TABLE    11\n</b>     Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room.\n     There's a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack-\n     ing flowers, good luck messages, cards and cables by the\n     mirror. Through the blur and bustle, we glimpse the doll\n     with its embroidered ribbon message \"RACHEL, WE LOVE YOU.\"\n     Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers\n     resting on the small portable TV set. On the screen is\n     an image of Rachel performing on stage, acknowledging\n     applause, bowing.\n     The doll EXPLODES, SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the\n<b>     LIGHT BULBS.\n</b>     The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS, SCREAMS and\n<b>     CONFUSION.\n</b><b>     TITLES END.\n</b><b>\n</b><b>                                                                      5.\n</b>\n\n<b>12   EXT. FRANK FARMER'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                 12\n</b>     Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun-\n     glasses on, a glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of\n     \"DON'T WALK AWAY RENEE\" come from a beat-up transistor\n<b>     RADIO.\n</b>\n     An old-fashioned lawn sprinkler lazily waves water back\n     and forth over the freshly cut grass.  Throwing knives\n     lay scattered nearby. A wooden post is  sticking out of\n     the ground in front of the fence at the back of the yard.\n     BILL DEVANEY, fiftyish, a distinguished-looking black\n     gentleman, stands nearby trying to engage Frank in a\n     conversation that up to this point hasn't been going well.\n     He's Rachel's personal manager.\n<b>                           DEVANEY\n</b>              So, you won't protect Rachel Marron\n              just because she's in show business?\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>              I don't do celebrities.\n<b>                           DEVANEY\n</b>              But the biggest money's in show\n              business people.\n     Frank says nothing. His  eyes are  closed behind the sun-\n     glasses. Devaney picks  up one of  the throwing knives.\n     He holds it carefully by the blade  and throws it. It\n     misses the post by three feet and  clatters against the\n     fence.\n     Frank opens his eyes, sees what's going on and closes his\n     eyes again.\n<b>                           DEVANEY\n</b>                     (picking up another\n                      knife)\n              Do you really do these things?\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>              Isn't she the one who collects\n              dolls?\n     This is enough to distract Devaney from his knife-throwing.\n<b>                           DEVANEY\n</b>                     (exasperated)\n              Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the\n              most famous people in America.

Rather, it re-\n     presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in\n     the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant\n     vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and\n     his burden. The audience must be put in the position of\n     looking, searching, scanning with him.)\n     He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick-\n     ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a\n     black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives\n     rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look.

Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth\n     and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.\n     Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is\n     parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it.\n<b>                           HENRY\n</b>              Can I help you?\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>              Are you the man on the intercom?\n<b>                            HENRY\n</b>              No.   Can I help you?\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>              My name is Edison.

MARRON MANSION - DAY                                  16\n</b>     Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm,\n     matronly woman who does a fine job running the house\n     without standing on custom.\n<b>                           EMMA\n</b>              I'll tell you quite honestly,\n              Mr. Ford, I don't know where\n              Mr. Devaney is.

Let me look.\n     She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There\n     are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being\n     repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around,\n     Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening\n     titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song\n     itself -- \"I HAVE NOTHING\" -- comes softly from concealed\n     speakers.\n<b>                            EMMA\n</b>               Please make yourself at home. Can\n               I get you anything?\n     Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer.\n     Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in\n     the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a\n     major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers\n     come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence.\n\n<b>17   INT.

MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18\n</b>     Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool\n     area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are\n     shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career:\n     A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records,\n     other statuettes and plaques.

Both are\n     goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank\n     looks down at the pool.\n<b>     FRANK'S POV\n</b>     Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven-\n     year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,\n     dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of\n     the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long\n     speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny\n     sits, some way off, embroidering.\n     Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL\n     BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another\n     Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy.\n     Frank follows the sound.\n\n<b>19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19\n</b>     Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is\n     coming from.\n     It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a\n     bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It\n     is packed with people, props and video equipment. There\n     is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized\n     chaos. MUSIC BLARES out.\n     A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance\n     number for a music video, directed by their choreographer\n     RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the\n     glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman\n     circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a\n     large-screen TV behind them.\n     In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a\n     proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand-\n     ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All\n     the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't\n     immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among\n     the big cushions.\n     As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel\n     chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and\n     makes his way over to him.\n     On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his\n     late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch\n     neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right.\n     The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down.\n     Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins.\n     Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being\n     used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through\n     the rehearsal.\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                              12.\n</b>\n\nIn one of the chairs, a pretty  woman in her  mid-thirties\n(NICKI, the woman we saw at the  premiere) is  knitting.\nShe glances occasionally at the  dancers. A   man sits next\nto a phone busily discussing a  contract with  someone at\nthe other end of the line.\n\nThe music climaxes and abruptly stops. The dancers hold\ntheir dramatic final poses for a second, then relax again.\nAPPLAUSE. The CLAPPING from the front sofa is loudest.\nThen LAUGHTER.\nFrom elsewhere in the room comes the voice of the VIDEO\n<b>DIRECTOR.\n</b>\n<b>                      DIRECTOR (O.S.)\n</b>         Playback, everybody!\nRachel's voice comes from the sofa.\n<b>                      RACHEL (O.S.)\n</b>         Come here, Rory!\nThe choreographer skips to the sofa and disappears from\nsight.

He's\n     watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video\n     player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's,\n     tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on\n     the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases\n     are circled.\n     As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression.\n     It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first\n     time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to\n     be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable.\n     He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian\n     Orthodox-type cross.

Her new video explodes across the video wall\n     behind her. The crowd surges forward.\n     Two security guards nervously tense up, watching the\n     crowd. When one fan tries to climb onstage, Frank\n     reaches out and unbalances him, so that the man falls\n     back into the audience. Another man climbs the stage on\n     the other side. One of the guards darts out like a\n     ballboy at a tennis match, pushes the fan back and\n     scurries to the far side to resume his vigilance. The\n     crowd is getting even more excited, pressing closer,\n     trying to touch Rachel.\n     The security guards move in, but Rachel gestures for\n     them to back off.\n<b>     ANGLE - FRANK\n</b>     Frank's task has suddenly become impossible.

The crowd roars\n     approval.\n     Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV\n     KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see\n     Henry listening, pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry\n     quickly scurries to an exit. Frank starts moving toward\n     the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel's\n     dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her\n     gleefully, like the dance partner she has been pretending\n     to be. One of security guards rushes forward to extri-\n     cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps hard\n     into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel.\n     She flies out of his grasp and tumbles off the front of\n     the stage -- into the adoring arms of a half dozen fans.\n     The audience goes wild. This is the kind of thing\n     Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The\n     scene resembles a rugby scrum... with Rachel the ball.\n\n     Frank sees Rachel being passed over the heads of fans --\n     deeper into the audience. Her dress is ripped and torn\n     apart. The silver headpiece is dislodged and disappears\n     into the crowd.\n<b>     CLOSE ON RACHEL\n</b>     Fear fills her face. She's gone over the edge, literally\n     and figuratively. She's lost control. Tony and the\n     security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming\n     bodies out of the way.

The  crowd immediately sides with him, yells\n     encouragement.  But Tony is the better man and sends him\n     sprawling. The  rest of the way to the curb opens up.\n     At the parking area Tony discovers there is no limo and\n     turns in bewilderment to Rachel. But she is not there.\n     A couple of people laugh.\n\n<b>68   EXT.

The auditorium is a mess; the\n     cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the\n     riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking\n     for something.\n     Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment\n     of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand\n     picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the\n     sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet\n     move on.\n\n<b>71   INT.

Opening the door to\n     her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead.\n\n<b>72   INT.

He steps back to the door. As he\n     approaches her she begins to tremble.\n     He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly\n     holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of\n     Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows.\n     Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are\n     shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does\n     it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and\n     not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked\n     still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her\n     gently into bed.\n     As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of\n     his hand.

The door at the other\n     end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking\n     wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he\n     is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast.\n     Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As\n     Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins\n     low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from\n     under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself\n     looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he\n     was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed\n     against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question-\n     ingly, as if to ask, \"Had enough?\"\n     Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony\n     stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony\n     throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank\n     ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and\n     throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks\n     around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall.\n     He holds it in front of him threateningly.\n     Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks\n     up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in\n     his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same\n     fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony.\n     It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony\n     does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks\n     up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances\n     at Tony.\n<b>                           FRANK\n</b>              I don't want to talk about this\n              again.\n\n<b>74   EXT.

A black in his\n     early twenties is finishing the exterior of the car.\n     A second pair of hands appear.    White hands in rubber\n     gloves. They open the  driver's   door and push a vacuum\n     suction hose inside.  The hands   switch ON the car RADIO,\n     loud.

In\n     the back of the car, Dan's hose probes around, nosing\n     into all the crevices of the upholstery. It sucks up a\n     crumpled pre-signed photograph of Rachel from the gap\n     beside the rear seat. The hose is switched off and the\n     gloved hands retrieve the picture.\n\n<b>77   INT.

Pasted over every inch of the locker\n     are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her\n     dancing with the word \"whore\" scrawled across it. Taped\n     to a single sheet of white paper in the center, like a\n     holy relic, is the torn scrap of Rachel's dress from the\n     MAYAN.

Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he\ngets the point, and then she's off again. The throng\ngets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering\nher towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar\nchant starts up: \"Rachel, Rachel.\" It's starting to\nresemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time,\namid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few\nbewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved\nforward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs\nand Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach\nhim. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd\nsurges again.\nAmid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.

When\n      their names have been checked off a master list, they\n      walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No\n      one likes it, but they all do it.\n      Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The\n      handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright\n      lights flaring.

When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving\n       faster, closing the gap.\n\n       The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear-\n       ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of\n       the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He\n       hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the\n       direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE.\n       Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he\n       hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up\n       ahead. Close.\n\n       The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready,\n       confident. He waits. Nothing.\n       Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He\n       raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready\n       to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something\n       really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we\n       hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun\n       15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS.\n       The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered\n       six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind\n       his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in\n       the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER\n       SHOT from Frank very close to the man.\n\n<b>176A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              176A\n</b>       Herb is at the window.
