You didn't make a\r\n           mistake. You made a choice. You\r\n           called me and left a message to\r\n           call back...that it was important.\r\n           But when I did...you said to forget\r\n           about it. You chose not to tell\r\n           me. Why did you make that choice?\r\n                          STEPHEN\r\n           I didn't think it was important.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           Sure you did. But you went because\r\n           you were curious, because you were\r\n           flattered. Because it made you feel\r\n           special to think Duffy wanted to\r\n           speak to you instead of me. Because\r\n           you thought to yourself: maybe I\r\n           can get something out of this.\r\n           Because it made you feel big.\r\n           First campaign I ran tiny little\r\n           race in Kentucky -state senate\r\n           seat. Workin for redneck nobody\r\n           named McGuthrie. Had no money, no\r\n           staff, no fuckin office. Everyone\r\n           thought we didn't stand a chance.\r\n           There's no way we can compete. And\r\n           about this time, a guy running a\r\n           congressional campaign a few\r\n           districts over gives me a call.\r\n           Says, \"I really like what you were\r\n           able to do for poor ole' Sam. But\r\n           let's face it, he's a goner, so why\r\n           don't you come work for me?\" What\r\n           do I do? Well Stephen -this is\r\n           where you and I are different. I\r\n           told Sam about the call. And Sam\r\n           says to me, \"Paul, you think this\r\n           other's guy's got a shot at\r\n           winning, and he can pay you more\r\n           than anything I can afford, so if\r\n           it's what you feel you need to do,\r\n           then I won't get in your way.\" So I\r\n           say, \"Sam -you took a chance and\r\n           hired me when I was even more of\r\n           nobody than you are, and I'd be\r\n           damned if I'm gonna jump ship just\r\n           because the shit hit the fan.\"\r\n           We lost the race, but three years\r\n           later, when Sam decided to run for\r\n           Governor -who do you think he\r\n           called? We won that race.\r\n                          (MORE)\r\n                         \r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n           74.\r\n                         CONTINUED: (4)\r\n                          PAUL (CONT'D)\r\n           And twenty years later I'm where I\r\n           am now. (Beat) There's only one\r\n           thing I value in this world Steve,\r\n           and that's loyalty. Without it\r\n           you're nothing and you have no one.\r\n           And in politics it's the only\r\n           currency that you can count on.\r\n           That's why I'm letting you go. Not\r\n           because you're not good enough. But\r\n           I value trust over skill. And I\r\n           don't trust you anymore.\r\n                         \r\n                          STEPHEN\r\n           Well it really isn't whether you\r\n           trust me, it's whether the Governor\r\n           does.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           The Governor knows, he thinks it's\r\n           the right thing to do.\r\n                         \r\n                          STEPHEN\r\n           He does.\r\n                         \r\n                          PAUL\r\n           If I were you?
