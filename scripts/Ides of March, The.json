XAVIER UNIVERSITY - GYMNASIUM - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n</b>                         \r\n          A wide shot of the darkened gymnasium. Stephen sits on a\r\n          stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light.\r\n                         \r\n          We're now in tight - One PERSON is putting a mic on Stephen\r\n          while the OTHER is applying make-up.\r\n                         \r\n          No one speaks.\r\n          The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          SOUND MAN\r\n</b>           You should be able to hear\r\n           them...do you hear them?\r\n                         \r\n          We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New\r\n          York.\r\n                         \r\n<b>                          STEPHEN\r\n</b>           Yeah I can hear them.\r\n<b>                          SOUND MAN\r\n</b>           Good, quick mic check can you count\r\n           to ten for me?\r\n          Stephen counts to ten. Everyone stands behind the camera.\r\n          The sound man with his headset on whispers..\r\n                         \r\n<b>           SOUND MAN (CONT'D)\r\n</b>           They're coming to you in about\r\n           forty five seconds.\r\n                         \r\n          We sit in silence staring at Stephens face.\r\n                         \r\n          Ten seconds - nothing.\r\n          Twenty seconds - nothing\r\n                         \r\n          This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium\r\n          - only a few people doing their individual jobs.\r\n                         \r\n          Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell\r\n          phones.\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n<b>                          (CONTINUED)\r\n</b><b>           99.\r\n</b><b>                         CONTINUED:\r\n</b>                         \r\n          The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset.\r\n                         \r\n          The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments.\r\n                         \r\n          A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance.\r\n          They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't -\r\n          but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen\r\n          has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all\r\n          cost.\r\n                         \r\n          We stay on Stephen's face.\r\n                         \r\n          We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.\r\n<b>           GOV.
