BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT\n          \n          On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, \n          surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle \n          RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. \n          \n          Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby \n          branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES \n          again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image \n          moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES \n          appear with every FIRING.\n          \n          On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:\n          \n          WAR MONTAGE\n          \n          Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:\n          \n          Cannon firing in all directions. \n          \n          Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. \n          \n          Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water \n          towering into the sky. \n          \n          An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar \n          fire visible above them on the horizon.\n          \n          Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their \n          muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt.

Cary looks down to see:\n          \n          Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes.

Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of \n          control.\n          \n          Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.\n          \n          Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of \n          the red hot controls.\n          \n          The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.\n          \n          Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.\n          \n          Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. \n          Francis, though, doesn't look happy.\n          \n          Shep twists in his seat and looks around.\n          \n          Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tSHEP (o.s.)\n          \t\tLevel off, Cary! Level off!\n          \n          Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.\n          \n          From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.\n          \n          The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.\n          \n          Smoke. Flames.\n          \n          Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to \n          clamber out.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tShep!

Get a hold - Just hold tight, \n          \t\told fella.\n          \n          Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two \n          of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.\n          \n          Flames consume the plane.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          A TEMPERATURE CHART\n          for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. \n          Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by \n          a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle \n          continues to RUMBLE.\n          \n          ANOTHER CHART\n          swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for \n          October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line \n          continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is \n          marked NORMAL.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY\n          The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of\n          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full \n          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He \n          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital \n          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost \n          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.\n          \n          SHEP AND CARY\n          stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.\n          \n          THE CLOCK \n          slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and \n          running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is \n          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a \n          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined \n          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades \n          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the \n          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING \n          of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- \n          Armistice Day. \n          \n          SHEP AND CARY\n          sit motionless side-by-side on the cot.

DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER\n          A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. \n          Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have \n          passed through close behind them.\n          \n          Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over \n          his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tDOCTOR\n          \t\tLieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. \n          \t\t\t(rises, joins them)\n          \t\tYou two leaving us, eh?

But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat \n          at them.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tBILL\n          \t\tSee you in Paris!\n          \n          \t\t\t\tFRANCIS\n          \t\t\t(waves his cigarette)\n          \t\tYeah.\n          \n          Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          EXT. THE EIFFEL TOWER - NIGHT\n          A superimposed text reads:\n          \n          \t\t\tPARIS -- 1919.\n          \n          Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT\n          Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our \n          heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes. \n          \n          Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But: \n          \n          Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye \n          twitching. \n          \n          Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His \n          personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as \n          the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged \n          leader.\n          \n          Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A \n          narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on \n          the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.\n          \n          Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is \n          William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, \n          restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and \n          forced exuberance.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tHow 'bout a cocktail?\n          \n          \t\t\t\tSHEP\n          \t\tNot a bad idea at that.\n          \n          As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tBRIEF DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          A GLOWING SIGN \n          made of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a \n          popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.\n          \n          \t\t\t\t\tDISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          INT. CLARIDGE'S - NIGHT\n          Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor.

CLARIDGE'S BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOT\n          The place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with \n          men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, \n          drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, \n          greeted by an employee who takes their hats.\n          \n          ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR\n          An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall \n          opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and \n          she seems to be in a world all to herself.\n          \n          Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary \n          pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn \n          and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the \n          glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses. \n          \n          After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand \n          together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary \n          keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:\n          \n          NIKKI\n          still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.\n          \n          THE GLASS\n          in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set \n          of men's false teeth.\n          \n          We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right \n          next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tI beg your pardon. But, if I'm not \n          \t\ttoo inquisitive, would you mind \n          \t\ttelling me what IS that you're \n          \t\tdrinking?\n          \n          \t\t\t\tNIKKI\n          \t\tTeeth.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tTeeth?\n          \n          After another look, Cary turns to his friends.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tHey, it's teeth!\n          \n          \t\t\t\tBILL (o.s.)\n          \t\tTeeth?!\n          \n          Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in \n          amazement at the teeth.

We're liable to see a \n          \t\tfight.\n          \n          As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart.

Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and \n          Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite \n          gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:\n          \n          \t\t\t\tBILL\n          \t\tWell.

It opens \n          with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, \n          peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's \n          remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink \n          to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:\n          \n          \t\t\t\tSHEP\n          \t\t\t(off Frink)\n          \t\tPay no attention.

Stunned, Nikki \n          watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly \n          wrong and moves to follow him.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tNIKKI\n          \t\tOh!\n          \n          But Shep intercepts her.

Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around \n          a tray and start imbibing. \n          \n          Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses \n          that are still balanced on his hands.\n          \n          For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet.

In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa.\n          \n          Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, \n          casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the \n          fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps \n          off the sofa. The others stare at him. \n          \n          \t\t\t\tSHEP\n          \t\tMy, my.

The bull chases them down, runs \n          across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden \n          barrier that circles the inside of the arena. \n          \n          Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of \n          toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below \n          him.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tBILL\n          \t\tNice work, Tony!

The end of the \n          barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of-\n          view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be \n          handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tOh, no, no, no, Nikki.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tNIKKI\n          \t\tHow do you hold it still?\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tListen, Nikki, on your right \n          \t\tshoulder.

He and Shep turn to watch in \n          amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole \n          row of pipes with split-second firing.\n          \n          The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an \n          astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink.

Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep \n          backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's \n          been hit.

He \n          starts to fall.\n          \n          Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink.\n          \n          Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching \n          his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis \n          lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done. \n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY'S VOICE\n          \t\tFrancis? \n          \n          Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tFrancis?\n          \n          Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the \n          gallery.

Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. \n          Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls \n          casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing \n          to glance backward. He sees ...\n          \n          ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little \n          breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps \n          weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ... \n          \n          ... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, \n          steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks \n          off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.\n          \n          Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.\n          \n          \t\t\t\tCARY\n          \t\tThat's the last of Francis, I'm \n          \t\tafraid.
