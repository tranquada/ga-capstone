With no sign of\n          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full \n          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He \n          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital \n          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost \n          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          SHEP AND CARY\n</b>          stare up at the clock.

The final image is \n          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a \n          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined \n          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades \n          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the \n          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING \n          of the clock remains.
