MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY\n\n        An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado\n        Rockies. The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out\n        of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains\n        like a low fog. The tranquility is broken as a helicopter\n        BLASTS into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center\n        of it all.\n\n        Our CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range.\n        There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high\n        pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches\n        to large plateaus. One of the mountains has a crystal lake on\n        top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the\n        middle of a mountain wall. Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder\n        is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top.\n\n        BACK IN THE HELICOPTER\n\n        We can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out --\n\n        INT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV\n\n        The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks\n        like nothing more than a field of gray and white.\n\n                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n                      Nothing yet.\n\n        EXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT\n\n        The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- \"The\n        Tower\", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by\n        a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below.\n\n        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE\n\n        Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall.  MAGGIE\n        DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm\n        winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as\n        members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team.\n\n                                        FRANK\n                      Wait a minute -- there's Hal.\n                            (beat)\n                      And his date.\n\n        BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE\n\n        that's part of the smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s) and his \n        \"date\", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), are decked out in climbing gear.  \n        Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's\n        worried look shows she isn't. Hal and Susan huddle together,\n        both cold, but okay. Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped\n        around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand.\n\n        INSIDE HELICOPTER\n\n        Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      How do they look?\n\n        BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN\n\n        Hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and\n        starts jerking off the flare.\n\n                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n                      He's signalling \"okay.\"\n\n                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)\n                      Where's Gabe?\n\n        The POV dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an\n        orange rescue jacket.\n\n                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n                      Right where he's supposed to be.\n\n        CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER\n\n        This is GABE WALKER (30s). In spite of the cold and the snow,\n        he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety\n        lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. That's because he\n        has done it a hundred times. This is what Gabe lives for.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE\n\n        Gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's\n        length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a\n        move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a\n        doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and\n        tries to light a cigarette. The lighter only sparks.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Excuse me -- I know you're my\n                      salvation, and all -- do you think you\n                      could rescue us before your smoke\n                      break?\n\n        Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart\n        style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield\n        it against the wind. Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar\n        routine. We know in a glance they've been friends for years.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Maybe you could tell me why I am\n                      rescuing you.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Basically -- I've fallen down, and I\n                      can't get up...\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (into radio)\n                      Rescue One -- have located helpless\n                      climber, please prepare idiot line\n                      for transport, over --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it\n        land there. Frank lowers a rescue wire to\n\n        GABE\n\n        who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the\n        wire is just out of reach. Hal grabs the radio.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Rescue One -- please remind me to tell\n                      you about the time I hauled your hero\n                      here down Mt. Huntington on my back,\n                      over --\n\n                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)\n                            (through radio)\n                      Hal, if I hear that story one more\n                      time, I'm making you limp down the\n                      entire three thousand feet, over --\n\n        Gabe finally grabs the line, secures it to a heavy piton, and\n        hammers it into the wall.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (to Susan)\n                      This guy showing you a good time?\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        swings over across to the facing mountain -- Maggie lands the\n        copter, in spite of the winds, on a small plateau. Frank gets\n        out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the\n        chasm.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE\n\n        Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he\n        extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets\n        the butt. Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a\n        seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it\n        around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Now, remember -- keep your arms and\n                      legs within the vehicle at all\n                      times --\n\n                                        HAL\n                            (laughing)\n                      Fuck you --\n\n        With that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping\n        line -- Hal makes a point of looking down --\n\n        HAL'S POV -- THE DROP\n\n        is vertigo defined. Thirty five hundred feet straight down.\n        You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each\n        other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high.\n        However --\n\n        HAL\n\n        lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face\n        in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet\n        of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out. Hal\n        gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals\n        thumbs-up, and sends it back.\n\n        THE LEDGE\n\n        Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and\n        gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly,\n        very scared. Gabe recovers the harness, rigs Susan into it,\n        and meticulously re-checks it.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Ready?\n                            (sees she's afraid)\n                      Did he tell you about the time he\n                      almost made it up Everest?\n\n                                        SUSAN\n                      He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask\n                      --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Well, if he's bored you with that\n                      bullshit, then this has to be the best\n                      part of a bad date. Right?\n\n        Susan nervously laughs.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Ready?\n\n                                        SUSAN\n                            (scared but tough)\n                      Okay --\n\n        Gabe starts to push her out on the line, but she grabs his arm\n        in a panic.\n\n                                        SUSAN\n                      I can't --\n\n        Susan starts to tilt her head down -- Gabe gently takes hold\n        of her chin, turning her view up to face him.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Yes you can.\n                            (reassuring)\n                      You can do it. Don't look down.  The\n                      whole way across, don't look down.\n                      Look at me. Just keep looking at me --\n                      and you'll be okay.\n\n        Susan looks at Gabe -- trying to be confident -- nods.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Sure?\n\n                                        SUSAN\n                      Yeah.\n                            (beat)\n                      I have always depended on the kindness\n                      of Rangers.\n\n        Gabe grins and gently pushes her out. Susan tentatively pulls\n        herself across -- then develops a rhythm, building speed --\n\n        GABE'S POV - SUSAN\n\n        inching away in the harness, looking more confident now --\n\n        SUSAN'S POV - GABE\n\n        signalling \"OK\" -- \"you're doing fine\" --\n\n        SUSAN - ANOTHER ANGLE\n\n        thirty feet out, going fine --\n\n        INSERT -- A HARNESS CLIP\n\n        holding the strap under Susan's left leg breaks --\n\n        GABE'S POV - SUSAN\n\n        The harness completely unravels all at once, its strands\n        shoot through the clips -- what was a seat has become a trap\n        door in half a second -- as the harness shoots out from under\n        her, Susan falls but grabs the harness strand --\n\n        HAL\n\n        is helpless, and can only watch as\n\n        SUSAN\n\n        too scared to breathe, dangles on the remaining strand of what\n        used to be the harness -- she sways from the wind and the jerk\n        of her own weight, her grip loosens --\n\n        INSERT - THE TOP CLIP\n\n        that is supporting all of Susan's weight is being seriously\n        tested -- a single knot in the harness has caught there, but\n        it clearly won't last long --\n\n        GABE\n\n        moves back from the ledge.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (loud, in control)\n                      Hold on. I'm coming out to get you.\n\n        Gabe gently pulls himself up on the line, crosses his ankles\n        on it, and clips himself on with a three foot safety line.\n        Gabe starts smoothly, quickly pulling himself out, but --\n\n        SUSAN\n\n        is in trouble -- the bobbing of the line from Gabe's weight\n        and the winds are making her lose her grip even more --\n\n        GABE\n\n        urgently pulls himself along the line faster, trying not to\n        shake the line. As he gets closer and closer to a terrified\n        Susan, his eyes lock on hers --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Keep looking at me.

Today.\n\n        Gabe's happy to see her -- but at the same time, he isn't.\n        She looks too good -- and she brings up quite a mixed bag of\n        memories.

RESCUE HELICOPTER - DAY\n\n        Maggie pilots the copter, heading out toward the mountain\n        range. Gabe fiddles with some of the equipment inside. Both\n        grope for a way to start the conversation.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      This is new...\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      It's a thermal scope -- picks up body\n                      heat of lost hikers --\n\n        Gabe flicks it on, looks at the total absence of heat as they\n        fly over the snow.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Still find the dead ones the old\n                      fashioned way, I guess.\n\n        So much for small talk.

Not much activity outside of some ROOKIE\n        CLIMBERS working out on a CLIMBING PRACTICE WALL. Maggie\n        starts to land the copter, and as she does --\n\n        INSIDE THE COPTER\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Do you really believe all that?  That\n                      it wasn't our fault?\n\n        Maggie slows the rotor, her eyes on the controls. Gabe's eyes\n        are locked on her.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                            (turns to Gabe)\n                      Yes.

Unlike the last time we saw them, neither man is glad to\n        see the other.

Nothing rattles you.\n\n        The rookie climbers get off the practice wall to watch this\n        faceoff. Gabe and Hal are one crack away from beating hell out\n        of each other.

Hal throws off the men holding him back -- but\n        instead of going at Gabe again, Hal throws Gabe a set of car\n        keys.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Take the Bronco to where you're going.\n                      I've already been.

The band is put back in the growing stack by\n\n        RICHARD TRAVERS\n\n        mid-thirties, a tough, imposing Treasury agent -- he regards\n        the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold,\n        professional interest. Travers is flanked by a trio of equally\n        tough TREASURY AGENTS -- he turns to flunky DAVIS (20s). It's\n        clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's\n        in charge of counting it.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      Tell Wright the San Francisco shipment\n                      is ready.\n\n                                        DAVID\n                            (phone already out)\n                      Right away, Mr. Travers.\n\n        As Davis dials we move to --\n\n        THE OFFICE\n\n        of WALTER WRIGHT (50s), comptroller of currency -- his\n        demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that\n        way.\n\n                                        WRIGHT\n                            (into phone)\n                      Good -- good.

Travers shuts the cases in turn, and\n        locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a FLASHING\n        RED LIGHT on the locks as he does.

The pilot, nervous, struggles with the controls.\n\n                                        PILOT\n                      We're right on the edge of the\n                      storm -- let's move it.\n\n        Travers pulls the two dead FBI agents out of the\n        compartment -- one is dressed in a flying suit like the pilot,\n        one in a suit like Travers.\n\n                                        PILOT\n                      This isn't going to work -- Wright\n                      will suspect something.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      So what. He'll sift though a plane\n                      that went down in a storm --\n                            (gestures to bodies)\n                      -- find enough pulverized bone for six\n                      men heroically killed in the line of\n                      duty --\n                            (finds three suitcases)\n                      -- and just enough of the right kind\n                      of ash.\n\n        Travers opens one of the cases, which is identical to the\n        others -- except that it's full of one dollar bills. He's\n        thought of everything.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      We get twenty-one gun funerals and\n                      they write off fifty million.

All are fit and armed --\n        HELDON and RYAN are seated, while KYNETTE and DELMER, ready to\n        help with the transfer, are on the opposite side of the door\n        from a very impatient Qualen.\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                            (into radio)\n                      Travers -- hurry it up.\n\n        INSIDE TREASURY JET\n\n        Travers, now in a harness like the one seen earlier -- uncuffs\n        the money cases from the agents.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (into radio)\n                      On my way.\n\n        Travers steps back into the cockpit and flips a toggle switch\n        over and LED --\n\n        THE LED\n\n        starts counting down from 2:00 -- 1:59 -- 1:58 --\n\n        IN THE COCKPIT\n\n        Even in the last minute, the storm's gotten worse -- the plane\n        is flying right into the blackest center of it. The pilot\n        looks more panicked than ever.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      That charge is going to blow both\n                      engines -- the plane'll go down like a\n                      rock, so clip yourself on to the end\n                      of the cable with the money as soon as\n                      I get over.\n                            (an afterthought)\n                      And make sure you bring the right\n                      cases.\n\n        Travers heads back into the cabin and hooks his harness to the\n        cable between the planes.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (into the headset)\n                      Dip the plane.

No. Maybe he wouldn't.\n\n        IN THE TREASURY PLANE COCKPIT\n\n        The pilot locks the controls and rushes back to the cabin.\n\n        THE LED\n\n        counts down -- 0:38 -- 0:37 -- 0:38 --\n\n        IN THE TREASURY PLANE CABIN\n\n        The pilot gathers the cases and uses their cuffs to attach\n        them to the cable -- but as he steps past the bodies of --\n\n        THE AGENTS\n\n        Matheson's eyes open -- he's not dead yet.\n\n        IN THE CABIN\n\n        The pilot clicks the last of the three cases onto the cable\n        and is about to put his harness on -- but behind him, Matheson\n        shakily crawls to his feet, draws his gun, and SHOOTS the\n        pilot in the back twice.\n\n        THE PILOT\n\n        drops out of the plane, flailing -- if he's screaming, we\n        can't hear it over the HOWLING of the storm --\n\n        IN QUALEN'S JET\n\n        Qualen and Travers are watching the whole plan unravel --\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (shouting to cockpit)\n                      Get underneath the jet!

Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      Hey there --\n\n       The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the\n       door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just\n       looks awkward.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Hi.\n                           (beat)\n                      Could you introduce us?\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      Sure.

She trust me --\n\n       Maggie reaches into the cage, but the eagle starts thrashing.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      I'm making her nervous --\n                           (beat)\n                      You hold her, I'll do the dressing.\n\n       Gabe finds another pair of gloves, sterile cotton pads and\n       alcohol in a drawer -- Maggie reaches in and grabs the eagle's\n       beak and talons quickly but gently, and takes it out of the\n       cage, holding it firm. This is clearly something they've done\n       many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and\n       Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage\n       the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and\n       yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the\n       wound.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Got some fight in her -- that's good.\n                           (beat)\n                      What happened to Dave?\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      The usual. Flew off -- never calls,\n                      never writes --\n\n       Gabe winces at this one as he carefully tapes the small patch\n       and sticks it on the eagle's side. Maggie puts the eagle back\n       in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't\n       move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe\n       tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him\n       hand away.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      I'm glad to see you, Gabe. But I kind\n                      of wish you hadn't come.

COMB BLUFF TRAILHEAD - WIDE SHOT - DAY\n\n        Relative to the other mountains, Comb Bluff is smaller --\n        about 2,500 feet high.

COMB BLUFF - LONG SHOT - DAY - GABE AND HAL\n\n        are now visibly two-thirds of the way up.\n\n        CLOSER ON GABE AND HAL - THE MOUNTAIN FACE\n\n        is not only higher, it's a lot tougher to climb. Instead of\n        being angular, the wall is now completely vertical -- and\n        coated with ice. Rough, irregular ice ledges are all Gabe and\n        Hal can grip -- it's a matter of grabbing what you can for a\n        handhold, and kicking the spikes of the steel crampons on\n        their boots into the ice for footholds. Gabe leads, planting\n        pitons into the ice, threading the rope through them as he\n        goes. Three steel pins between Gabe and Hal. Their only safety\n        net. Gabe, trailing rope behind him, goes up a difficult slab\n        of ice and climbs under a ledge, where he anchors the rope in\n        the ice with another piton.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (shouting down)\n                      Anchored!\n\n        HAL\n\n        is beside and slightly below Gabe -- at the other end of the\n        fifty foot rope. Hal cautiously pulls himself along the line\n        to the first piton -- as is standard for a climb, he pulls out\n        the piton, then moves on to the second -- but up above\n\n        HIGHER ON THE MOUNTAIN\n\n        Ice, building in a small crevase, builds and CRACKS the\n        adjoining rock -- several ten-pound boulders fall, causing a\n        chain reaction\n\n        ROCKSLIDE\n\n        that bounces down the wall --\n\n        GABE\n\n        hugs the ice wall, making himself as flat as possible --\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (shouting down)\n                      Rockslide!\n\n        HAL\n\n        flattens too as rocks bounce past -- the second anchoring\n        piton LOOSENS as it is struck by a falling rock -- Hal\n        nervously eyes the last piton between him and Gabe --\n\n        THE PITON - CLOSE\n\n        also has been clipped by the still falling boulders and droops\n        at half mast -- no way are these going to hold in the\n        unreliable ice --\n\n        HAL\n\n        tries to stay flat, but one boulder painfully CLIPS him on the\n        shoulder, knocking him from his perch -- Hal falls --\n\n        WIDER - HAL FALLING\n\n        In falling, Hal's weight on the rope yanks out the nearest\n        anchor piton -- Hal tumbles in space, keeping pace with the\n        boulders, as --\n\n        GABE\n\n        who's seen everything we have, quickly reaches to the piton\n        he's just anchored, and removes the carabiner clip --\n\n        HAL - FALLING\n\n        The rope draws taut, yanking out the last piton between he and\n        Gabe -- nothing but a few yards of slack rope now --\n\n        GABE\n\n        has the bolt gun out.

From here, the rest of the range looms\n        large. Even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular\n        sight -- but Gabe and Hal don't pause to enjoy it. This isn't\n        a trip for sport.

FACING MOUNTAIN - WIDE SHOT\n\n        Hal and Gabe lead the \"expedition\" down a steep, but passable,\n        descent, leading to --\n\n        A NATURAL STONE BRIDGE\n\n        that links Comb Bluff with the next mountain.

Wide enough even for an\n        amateur. The others follow Gabe and Hal's example.\n\n                                                           DISSOLVE TO:\n\n        EXT.

Once they've got what they're\n                      after -- they're gonna need a copter\n                      to get out of here.\n\n                                        HAL\n                            (realizing)\n                      Maggie.\n\n        Gabe nods grimly -- and keeps moving up. The rest keep pace.\n\n        THE WALL\n\n        The climbers have reached a point of comparative comfort on\n        the wall -- the ledge is now two feet wide. Travers takes out\n        the tracer monitor -- the monitor shows that the first case is\n        just above them.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      Hold it.\n                            (beat)                      \n                      It's up there.\n\n        \"UP THERE\" - AN OVERHANG\n\n        juts out of the wall fifty feet above their position. As the\n        rest of the wall above is completely sheer, it's obvious that\n        the case, if it is above, has landed on top of a ledge.\n\n        But this isn't easily accessible -- we MOVE DOWN from the\n        overhang and can see there are only the smallest of handholds\n        to get up there, and those are slick with ice and snow. Worse,\n        the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making\n        climbing almost impossible.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE\n\n        Travers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up\n\n                                        TRAVERS \n                      Fetch.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      I'll need the ice axe.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (laughs)\n                      You've got to be kidding.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (sighs)\n                      Okay. How about some tape?\n\n        Travers nods -- Kynette pulls a roll of tape out of Gabe's\n        confiscated pack and throws it to him.\n\n\n                                        GABE         \n                      Crampons too.\n\n        Travers hesitates, but nods -- Kynette throws him the iron\n        spikes. Gabe fastens them to his boots.\n\n        Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him. In\n        spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small\n        these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and\n        his fingers.\n\n        HIGH ANGLE - GABE\n\n        moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are\n        hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet\n        up, there's nothing. To keep going, Gabe has to painfully\n        wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting\n        his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment.\n        We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet\n        from solid ground. We can see from his face that he's trying\n        not to think about it.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN\n\n        watch Gabe's slow progress.\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                      I don't trust him.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (indicating wall)\n                      Where could he go?\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                      I'd rather he didn't show us.\n                            (beat)\n                      We don't need two guides.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (shrugs)\n                      You win. Kill him when he gets down.\n\n        GABE ON THE WALL - CLOSE\n\n        Make that \"if he comes down\". Gabe is now in one of the\n        worst positions possible for a free climb. He is moving up\n        the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging\n        upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support.\n        It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the\n        abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock\n        again and again. Gabe keeps his hold with one hand and slides\n        the other up, hammering it into a crack wedge with ice --\n        some of the ice chips whistle past and down --\n\n        -- finally, Gabe gropes one hand over the edge, and pulls\n        himself onto\n\n        THE OVERHANG\n\n        Exhausted, Gabe pulls himself prone across the top. Something\n        hard is underneath him -- Gabe recovers and brushes the snow\n        off the money case that's underneath. It's battered from the\n        fall, but is still barely holding together. Gabe manages to\n        force open the trashed locks -- he looks inside the case, and\n        fingers a band of $5000s.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Jesus.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN\n\n        look up. They can see Gabe has made it -- but they can't see\n        him, or the case.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (impatient, shouting)\n                      Lower it down -- now!\n\n        ON THE OVERHANG - GAB\n\n        has no intention of doing this -- he snaps the case shut and\n        looks over at a ledge that moves off from it -- and at the ice\n        and snow above.\n\n        ON THE LEDGE - TRAVERS AND QUALEN'S POV\n\n        try to look up and locate Gabe. They can't. Until -- \n\n                                        GABE (O.S.)\n                            (shouting down)\n                      I've got a better idea. Why don't you\n                      come up and get it?\n\n        With the case, Gabe moves, back against the wall, on a ledge\n        that skirts off the overhand -- from Travers and Qualen's\n        point of view. Gabe can hardly be seen -- since the mountain\n        bulges out as it goes up.

In spite of the cold and wind, he's drenched\n        in sweat, half exertion, half fear. We pull back to take in\n\n        THE EAST WALL - LONG SHOT\n\n        Envision a wall. A really big wall. A really, really big wall.\n        A wall that's as wide as it is high -- five thousand feet by\n        five thousand feet -- narrowing to a domed peak at the summit.\n\n        Now picture the same wall, checkered with ice. If this were\n        horizontal, you or I couldn't walk on it without falling.\n\n        Now picture the same wall with an orange dot, two-thirds of\n        the way up it. The orange dot is\n\n        GABE\n\n        and he barely has the strength to hold on, much less go up.\n        Gabe holds himself steady with one hand, gets a foothold, and\n        swings another hand up to SLAM it against the wall.\n\n        He's improvised gear -- he's tied a crampon to one hand. But\n        it's as awkward as it sounds. Gabe moves up only a foot or so\n        -- then pulls out the crampon, reaches up, and SLAMS it into \n        the wall, starting the painful process over again.\n\n                                                           CUT TO;\n\n        INT.

THE EAST FACE - WIDE SHOT - DAY - GABE\n\n        is clearly exhausted and freezing -- his lips are blue, his\n        eyebrows encrusted with snow. Wind still threatens to knock\n        him off the wall -- but he forces himself on.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (teeth chattering)\n                      A steambath.\n                            (spikes himself up)\n                      A steambath -- and a bottle of\n                      whiskey.\n                            (new foothold)\n                      A steambath with a bottle of\n                      Glenlivet.

Gabe\n        takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice\n        overhead with more force than usual. This one is going to have\n        to hold.\n\n        Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping\n        that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall.\n\n        Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand\n        are keeping Gabe from falling. Gabe needs the second crampon\n        to make the move up -- but that's not going to be easy to get.\n        It's attached to his boot.\n\n        As Gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he\n        reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon.\n\n        GABE'S POV - DOWN\n\n        The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away. Gabe\n        fumbles desperately with the buckles on the crampons -- but\n        both his fingers, and the buckles, are frozen stiff --\n\n        GABE'S FACE\n\n        shows real, solid terror for the first time --\n\n        GABE'S POV - DOWN\n\n        Gabe gets the first buckle off -- then the second. The crampon\n        is off his boot.\n\n        GABE\n\n        still swinging from one hand, takes the now-freed crampon and\n        slams it into the ice. It doesn't hold -- but the force of\n        Gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other\n        crampon. Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings\n        the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the\n        same split second as the other dislodges.\n\n        But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons, Gabe\n        quickly manages to climb up over the lip of\n\n        THE ICE OVERHANG\n\n        This is a field of ice sloping up to the top. Gabe pulls\n        himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons\n        back on his feet where they belong. It's now pretty simple for\n        Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to\n\n        THE SUMMIT\n\n        which is a rocky, wooded area. Gabe seems to have a second\n        wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit. The other\n        side is obviously the route Hal and the others will be\n        taking -- beneath the summit is a winding, well-beaten path.\n        Gabe finally arrives at a small shack with a sign nearby\n        commemorating the \"DOUGLAS EXPEDITION - 1933\".\n\n        INT. THE SHACK\n\n        is just a small \"point of interest\" shed for hardy tourists\n        who have hiked up this far -- there is a corny photo stand,\n        where you stick your head through a hole, so your face is put\n        on top of a cartoon climber hacking up a mountain. Gabe rushes\n        past this to a glass display case on the wall.\n\n        THE GORDON DOUGLAS DISPLAY\n\n        has black and white photos of a square jawed 1930s climber\n        with his expedition -- more important is what's beneath it.\n        Douglas' original climbing equipment -- a coil of rope, some\n        pitons, a hat, a cloth backpack, small binoculars, other odds\n        and ends. Gabe prepares to smash the glass -- and hesitates.\n        Respect.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (sighing)\n                      Sorry, Gordon -- I promise I'll have\n                      it back tomorrow.\n\n        Gabe SMASHES the glass as we move to --\n\n        EXT. THE TRAIL - DAY\n\n        Hal is leading Qualen, Travers and the others upward -- this\n        is a comparatively easy route, but still tiring. The sun goes\n        down beyond a facing, taller mountain. Ryan is huffing and\n        puffing -- the altitude and exertion are getting to him. Hal\n        allows himself a smile at his discomfort.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Come on -- tourists take this trail.\n\n        Qualen pokes Hal with the gun -- he moves on ahead.\n\n        EXT. THE SUMMIT - DUSK\n\n        It's getting dark rapidly -- Gabe has scaled a rock formation\n        so he has a view of the rest of the summit --\n\n        GABE'S POV - SCANNING THE TREELINE\n\n        Gabe slowly looks along the trees of the summit -- looks\n        pretty ordinary to us, but something must have caught Gabe's\n        eye, because he swings back to look at one tree. With broken\n        branches on top.\n\n        GABE\n\n        climbs down from his rock perch and rushes toward the tree.\n\n        EXT. SUMMIT TRAIL - NIGHT\n\n        This \"expedition\" reaches the top -- Hal is in the lead, with\n        Qualen just inches behind. Qualen shoves Hal forward.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      Is this it?\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Yeah.

Get out of the way.\n\n        Travers takes out the tracer and starts following the blip.\n\n        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT - GABE\n\n        frantically rushes around, looking for the case -- he spots a\n        crater of snow, rushes to it and starts digging. Even below\n        the snow, the tracer's blinking red light is glowing and\n        visible. Gabe laughs as he digs it out.\n\n        NEARBY ON THE SUMMIT - TRAVERS\n\n        has his eyes glued to the tracer monitor, which shows the case\n        is nearby.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (smiling)\n                      This way.\n\n        Qualen shines a light -- all of them push their way through\n        the trees.\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        is excited now -- he can't even wait for Qualen's flashlight,\n        he intuitively races through the trees, dividing his attention\n        between his surroundings and\n\n        THE MONITOR\n\n        which shows he's practically on top of the case -- finally\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        shoves his way through some small pines -- he can see the\n        blinking of the red tracer light ahead through the branches.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (calling behind)\n                      It's over here!\n\n        Travers shoves his way through the branches, and heads for the\n        light -- but something's wrong -- Qualen comes up behind\n        Travers and shines the light on\n\n        A SNOWMAN\n\n        cute, if hastily constructed, stands with a five-pebble smile,\n        as well as Douglas' cap, in a clearing. The still blinking,\n        still operable tracer is now the nose of the snowman. The case\n        is leaned up against it.\n\n        Travers runs over to the case, furious, and opens it. It's\n        empty -- except for a single $5000 bill. Travers picks it\n        up -- scrawled on the margin is \"LET'S TRADE.\"\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (incredulous)\n                      He's still alive.\n                            (furious)\n                      He's still alive!\n                            (to Qualen and the\n                             others)\n                      He can't be far away -- spread out!\n\n        Qualen, Kynette, Delmer and Krystel fan out into the woods,\n        each with a flashlight and a fun.

But he doesn't see\n\n        RYAN - \"NIGHTFINDER\" POV\n\n        With these goggles, light is amplified a thousandfold -- this\n        isn't one of those infra-red, thermo-blob jobs -- it looks\n        more like day for night photography.

All that's beneath him is\n\n        GABE'S POV\n\n        -- a sudden, sloping plunge down a field of ice. No escape\n        route here -- anything that goes down this slide is going all\n        the way to the ground far below.\n\n        GABE\n\n        is driven forward by a fresh burst of bullets -- he dives to\n        the edge of the ice field and ducks behind a boulder -- the\n        sole source of cover.\n\n        ELSEWHERE ON THE SUMMIT\n\n        Kristel, Qualen and Kynette, having heard the gunshots, are\n        now rushing to Gabe's position --\n\n        RYAN\n\n        almost casually emerges from the woods. He can see there is\n        nowhere for Gabe to have gone -- except behind the boulder. He\n        walks toward it as if he had all the time in the world.\n\n        GABE\n\n        fumbles in his backpack and pulls out something from the\n        Douglas exhibit -- an ancient flare that looks like a can of\n        sterno. Gabe pulls out his lighter and tries to light it -- it\n        resists and looks like a dud, but finally it catches, and as\n        it ignites Gabe heaves it over the boulder at Ryan --\n\n        RYAN - \"NIGHTFINDER\" POV - THE FLARE\n\n        arcs over the boulder to fully ignite, turning everything\n        into a blinding, agonizing flash of white --\n\n        RYAN\n\n        SCREAMS, putting one hand over the goggles, trying to rip them\n        off --\n\n        GABE\n\n        bolts out from behind the boulder to rush him --\n\n        RYAN\n\n        instantly aware of what Gabe's doing, blindly shoots, fanning\n        out in a semi-circle as he gets the goggles off --\n\n        GABE\n\n        just runs straight ahead to Ryan, getting to him before the\n        machine gun field of fire can intersect his path -- Gabe\n        tackles Ryan as he manages to get the goggles off -- both men\n        fall to the ground, and --\n\n        The machine gun CLATTERS away, landing on the edge of the ice,\n        just out of reach -- Ryan, now recovered from the blinding\n        flash, pulls an ice axe out of a pack sheath and swings it at\n        Gabe -- Gabe rolls away in time, and gets to the machine gun,\n        grabbing it -- But Ryan dives for Gabe, slamming into him --\n        the force of it knocks the machine gun loose -- it skips down\n        the ice slope -- but the momentum of Ryan's hit also carries\n        both Gabe and Ryan over the edge, onto --\n\n        THE ICE SLOPE\n\n        Gabe and Ryan both tumble over the edge and start sliding\n        down, Ryan face first on his stomach, Gabe head first and on\n        his back -- both are in immediate agony, because\n\n        CLOSE ON THE ICE\n\n        -- it's covered with razor sharp, irregular ridges, both large\n        and small, that slice through clothing and shred skin as they\n        pick up speed --\n\n        GABE'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV - THE ICE FIELD\n\n        The edge and a five thousand foot drop are less than a hundred\n        yards away --\n\n        GABE AND RYAN SLIDING\n\n        Ryan flails and SCREAMS as the ice gashes him from\n        underneath -- Gabe, however, manages to flip over and to the\n        side -- he lunges on top of Ryan and rides him down like a\n        bobsled --\n\n        GABE'S POV - END OF THE ICE SLOPS\n\n        is coming up too fast --\n\n        GABE\n\n        tries to maintain his perch on Ryan, who is SCREAMING and not\n        yet used to the idea of being a human sled -- he isn't\n        remaining still enough to provide a smooth ride -- Gabe\n        frantically reaches behind to Ryan's wrist to get the ice axe,\n        trailing from a wrist strap, but Ryan's arm is thrashing away,\n        threatening to toss off the axe --\n\n        ON SUMMIT\n\n        Qualen, Kristel and Kynette arrive at the lip, and look down,\n        incredulous --\n\n        QUALEN POV - GABE RIDING RYAN\n\n        Gabe and Ryan, accelerating, have almost reached the edge --\n\n        GABE\n\n        finally grabs the ice axe, pulling it off Ryan's wrist -- just\n        as they reach the precipice edge, Gabe loops the axe to his\n        wrist and swings toward the ice with everything he's got --\n\n        The axe's scythe-like blade catches on the ice, right at the\n        lip of the precipice -- Gabe is wrenched to a painful halt,\n        suspended over the drop, as what's left of Ryan, still\n        SCREAMING, shoots over the edge --\n\n        Gabe unhooks the axe, and gets another handhold. Gabe uses the\n        axe to climb further down the ice to some rock -- finding\n        easier hand holds, he quickly disappears into the darkness.\n\n        QUALEN, KRISTEL AND KYNETTE\n\n        look down -- Ryan's death scream is still echoing.

DOUGLAS TOURIST SHACK - NIGHT\n\n        The expedition has holed up here for the night -- Travers and\n        Qualen look upset. Things aren't going as well as they'd\n        hoped. Kristel tries to get some candy out of a vending\n        machine that's obviously empty. Kynette saws at some camp food\n        with a distinctive knife -- the handle is a set of brass\n        knuckles. Delmer guards Hal, who is bound, and seated by the\n        souvenir photo stand.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Well -- look at the bright side.\n                            (beat)\n                      At least you've only got to make the\n                      split five ways now.\n\n        EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE - NIGHT\n\n        Gabe confidently drops down onto a large ledge that juts out\n        from the wall -- obviously familiar territory for him. The\n        ledge leads to a small, enclosed cave. Gabe takes out his\n        penlight and shines it -- but the light looks dim. Batteries\n        are low. Gabe pockets it, flicks his lighter and goes in --\n\n        THE CAVE\n\n        in the flickering light, we can see that no one has been in\n        here for a while -- snow, dust, rocks -- but we should also\n        recognize this from the photo seen earlier as Gabe, Maggie and\n        Hal's hangout.\n\n        GABE\n\n        smiles with the memories -- then his face brightens with one\n        memory in particular. Gabe rushes to a corner of the cave and\n        opens a rock-lid to a hiding place.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Please still be there -- oh,\n                      please --\n\n        Gabe reaches in the stash and finds an ancient half-full pint\n        of Jack Daniels. The first thing to go right all day. Gabe\n        uncaps it and gratefully gulps down a double shot. Peace, at\n        last. Gabe smiles and leans against the wall, closing his eyes\n        -- but he's startled instantly by a SCREECH -- Gabe's eyes\n        shoot open --\n\n        An aggressive rat scurries toward him on the floor.\n\n        Gabe grabs a rock and CLOBBERS the rat off-screen, ending the\n        screeches with one blow. Gabe's face first registers\n        disgust -- then an idea. Then real disgust. Sighing, Gabe\n        pulls out a pocket knife and opens the blade.\n\n                                                           CUT TO:\n\n        INT. THE CAVE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON GABE\n\n        Gabe takes the now cooked rat carcass -- properly skinned and\n        butchered -- off his knife blade. We can see from flickering\n        shadows that a small fire is now burning in a cave -- we\n        pull back to see\n\n        THE FIRE\n\n        which is built out of small bundles of $5,000 bills. It's safe\n        to say that something like $500,000 is going up in smoke, and\n        the fire's dying down. Gabe tosses a fresh band of bills on\n        the flame. Gabe cools the knife in some snow, saws off a rat\n        leg, and chews unhappily.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (mouth full)\n                      Mmm. Just like -- chicken.\n\n        Gabe sparingly washes the bite down with a taste of Jack\n        Daniel. It's going to have to last him. He has an entire rat\n        to get through.\n\n                                                          DISSOLVE TO:\n\n        EXT.

An easy way down.\n\n        BRETT AND EVAN\n\n        are crouched in the woods. Brett, gun in hand, has no idea how\n        far out of his league he is.

It's relatively sheer, but\n        there are shelves cut into it to make walking easy.\n\n        MOUNTAIN TOP/SUMMIT - BRETT\n\n        races quietly through the woods in a parallel path with Hal,\n        who's guiding the hang.

But Travers stops for a second -- he\n        has spotted\n\n        EVAN'S FOOTPRINTS\n\n        in the snow -- not unlike a neon arrow.\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        runs in the direction of the footprints and quickly closes the\n        gap between him and\n\n        EVAN\n\n        who tries to pull on the chute and run at the same time --\n        it's not easy. Evan closes one of the three buckles -- but\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        bursts out of the woods and runs up right behind him --\n\n        QUALEN AND KRISTEL\n\n        in the meantime, get behind Hal in a clearing -- Kristel FIRES\n        over his head.\n\n                                        KRISTEL\n                      Stop!\n\n        Hal, caught again, freezes in his tracks.\n\n        EVAN\n\n        is still up and running -- he dodges Travers' fire, weaving\n        through trees, getting the second buckle closed -- he sees the\n        edge, just ahead, and puts on an extra burst of speed --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        does likewise, still firing -- his clip runs out, but this\n        only buys Evan an extra few seconds --\n\n        THE SPUR\n\n        is a rock formation that just out like a diving board -- Evan\n        runs like hell to the edge of it --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        is right behind him, and has slapped a fresh clip in place,\n        but before he can shoot --\n\n        EVAN\n\n        dives off the edge and clasps the third buckle --\n\n        ON THE LEDGE - GABE\n\n        is directly below a few hundred feet -- looking up, he thinks\n        Evan has made it -- but\n\n        ON THE SPUR EDGE - TRAVERS\n\n        throws himself down, aims quickly but carefully, and FIRES\n        twenty rounds towards Evan's falling figure --\n\n        EVAN - FALLING\n\n        Evan LAUGHS -- he hasn't been hit --\n\n        GABE - WATCHING\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Come on -- wait till you're out of\n                      range -- don't pull it yet --\n\n        LONG SHOT - EVAN FALLING\n\n        Several seconds pass -- Evan is now several hundred feet down\n        and apparently out of firing range --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        stops firing -- but doesn't seem unhappy at all.\n\n        EVAN\n\n        LAUGHS more and pulls the D-ring -- the parachute billows\n        open, inflating --\n\n        CLOSE ON THE PARACHUTE\n\n        which has been shredded by bullets that hit the pack -- as\n        quickly as it inflates, it deflates through dozens of\n        holes -- whatever resistance is left vanishes as the canopy\n        collapses.\n\n        EVAN'S\n\n        exhilaration turns to panic as he frantically pulls on the\n        chute's guide lines -- but the more he does this, the faster\n        the chute caves in -- he SCREAMS as the chute finally gives\n        way and plummets right past\n\n        GABE ON THE LEDGE\n\n        who is powerless to do anything but watch --\n\n        EVAN\n\n        falls the long, full five thousand feet, desperately,\n        uselessly, pulling in the lines of the tattered chute until\n        he's tangled in it like a shroud --\n\n        GABE\n\n        turns away -- he can't watch Evan hit bottom -- he grimaces\n        and looks up with absolute hate at\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        who doesn't see Gabe -- he's laughing at Evan's desperation,\n        which ends as his death scream is cut off.\n\n        Hal is led over to the spur, with the other gang members\n        behind him.

You will.\n\n        LONG SHOT OF MOUNTAIN\n\n        On top, Hal reluctantly leads the gang away -- below, we can\n        see Gabe start out on a parallel path along the ledges.\n\n        EXT. RANGER STATION - HELIPAD - DAY\n\n        Winds or not, Maggie is untying the helicopter's rotor from\n        the bolts on the helipad. Frank, who has obviously just\n        awakened, rushes out of the station.\n\n                                        FRANK\n                      Maggie -- what are you doing --\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      I'm going to go nuts if I sit here one\n                      more hour.\n\n                                        FRANK\n                      Still a little breezy out, Mag --\n\n        Maggie gets into the helicopter and starts the rotor.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                            (over engine's whine)\n                      You coming?\n\n        Frank hesitates, but climbs in the other side. The helicopter\n        lifts off and heads toward the mountain range.\n\n        EXT. MOUNTAIN - AERIAL SHOT - DAY\n\n        The next obstacle Hal is leading the gang through is a\n        buttress -- a large, stark boulder formation -- that lays\n        between the mountain they've just come from, and the nearest\n        mountain to it: the Tower. This is lower down from the\n        summit -- it's solid and treeless.\n\n        Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they\n        climb in single file up to the top. Terrain is flat enough\n        that the climb amount to an uphill run on all fours.\n\n        CLOSER ON HAL AND GANG\n\n        Hal leads the gang forward -- and keeps casting anxious\n        glances back at them. And beyond them. Travers notices this.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      Forget about it. He's smart, but he's\n                      not invisible.\n\n        Hal looks back. Travers is right. There's absolutely no way\n        Gabe can come up behind them without being seen.\n\n        LOWER DOWN ON BLUFF\n\n        where the bluff meets a tree-lined plain. Gabe, in hiding,\n        watches Hal and the others go up. No, he can't follow them up\n        the bluff's side without being seen. But Gabe moves closer to\n        the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the\n        beginning of\n\n        THE \"CHIMNEY\"\n\n        A crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff.\n\n        GABE\n\n        pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack.\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE CHIMNEY\n\n        Starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice\n        runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a\n        zig-zag, not a straight line.\n\n        Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman. The crack moves\n        upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again.\n        The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to\n        six feet. And that's just how it looks on the outside.\n        There's no telling what the interior is like.\n\n        Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. It's\n        hard to see much -- it's very, very dark. But it looks as if\n        the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all\n        the way up it. On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the\n        mountain instead of going up the side.\n\n        GABE\n\n        puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack,\n        starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the\n        mountain formation.\n\n        EXT. COLORADO WILDERNESS - PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY\n\n        A frenzy of activity, as several dozen Treasury agents sift\n        through the snow for the wreckage of the CT-39, some taking\n        photos, some taking videotapes, some putting the pieces into\n        bags for analysis. Many bags. Many small bags.\n\n        WIDER ON CRASH SITE\n\n        The Treasury plane has been completely pulverized by the crash\n        and its subsequent explosion -- there are few pieces here that\n        aren't charred, and fewer still that are any larger than a\n        paperback book.\n\n        WRIGHT\n\n        unhappily walks through the carnage and past agents gathering\n        up the plane, to a harried crash specialist from the FAA --\n        ROSS STUART (40s) -- who is organizing the debris.\n\n                                        WRIGHT\n                      What can you confirm?\n\n                                        STUART\n                      Well, sir -- it crashed. That, I can\n                      confirm.\n                            (condescending)\n                      We've been here just about one hour.\n                      These events take months to analyze.\n                      So if you'll excuse me --\n\n        He walks away -- but Wright, pissed, spins him around.\n\n                                        WRIGHT\n                      No, I don't think I will. The reason\n                      the FAA pays you is to exercise your\n                      vast, amazing knowledge of these\n                      \"events\". So I expect you to come up\n                      with some stunning insights, something\n                      a slow-witted fuck like me hasn't\n                      already observed.\n                            (gesturing to wreckage)\n                      One: it didn't blow up in mid-air,\n                      because the debris isn't widely\n                      dispersed. But was there a bomb on\n                      board that could have disabled it? I\n                      wonder.\n                            (pointing back)\n                      Two: There wasn't an attempted\n                      landing. Otherwise, there'd be debris\n                      to the east of the wreckage, where the\n                      plane was coming from. Did it come\n                      straight down? That's got me\n                      scratching my head too.\n                            (gesturing back to\n                             wreckage)\n                      And three: the flight recorder's\n                      tracer led us here in the first place.\n                      So where is the goddamn thing?

TOP OF THE BLUFF/VISTA - DAY\n\n        A vista. From this point, you can see everything else in the\n        mountain range. The only thing left that's taller is the\n        Tower, a hundred yards away. Between the two mountains lies a\n        drop of a mere four thousand feet.\n\n        Hal has led the rest of the gang up to the edge. Travers\n        approaches him, furious.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      I thought you said there was an easy\n                      way across.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      There is. You might not like it much.\n\n        Hal points\n\n        FURTHER DOWN\n\n        A steep two hundred yard downhill climb leads to a wire that\n        bridges the two mountains. The same wire we saw at the\n        beginning -- left behind from Susan Collins' botched rescue.\n\n        TOP OF BLUFF - HAL AND TRAVERS\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Of course -- we'll have to do it hand\n                      over hand.

Lead on.\n\n        Hal is surprised to see Kynette pull a harness out of his pack\n        -- the one Travers used earlier. Disappointed, Hal leads the\n        downward climb, looking several hundred yards to\n\n        THE CRACK\n\n        running up, and through, the bluff, coming out on this side.\n\n        HAL'S FACE\n\n        registers a thought -- will he? -- then dismissal. Nah. He\n        couldn't.\n\n        INT. THE CRACK/CHIMNEY - CLOSE ON GABE'S FACE\n\n        Gabe is sweating, straining in the dark, climbing up -- this'd\n        be a good spot to pull back and take in the view, except --\n\n        THE CHIMNEY\n\n        -- there's nowhere to pull back to. There's about two inches\n        of clearance between Gabe's chest and the rock, and about the\n        same between his back and the rock. To the right, there is no\n        light. At all. To the left, there's no light. Even above,\n        there is no light, because the crack isn't straight -- nature\n        isn't that obliging -- it zig-zags up. Gabe is well within the\n        mountain rock. Nothing could be closer to being buried alive\n        Gabe snakes through a spot where the crack goes straight up --\n        he takes out his penlight and turns it on --\n\n        GABE'S POV - INSIDE THE CRACK AROUND HIM\n\n        even this dim light reveals scores of bats hanging on the\n        wall, surrounding him, up and down, left and right --\n\n        GABE'S FACE\n\n        is stuck somewhere between nausea and the realization that\n        he's made a big mistake.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      I didn't need to see that.

One wolf turns to SNARL at Maggie\n        -- but Frank runs up and pulls a gun from a holster.\n\n        Frank aims high and FIRES twice to scare the pack -- the\n        wolves run off. Maggie goes to the body -- Frank holds her\n        back, but she goes ahead anyway, worried it might be Gabe --\n\n        TIGHT ON MAGGIE\n\n        as she examines the body --\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      It's Evan.\n                            (she stands, looks up)\n                      Parachute failed.\n\n                                        FRANK\n                            (not unkindly)\n                      Damn fool.

BLUFF CRACK/CHIMNEY\n\n        Gabe has a quick climbing rhythm now. He pulls himself up with\n        his hands, then braces his body with his back, and pulls\n        himself up again -- he's not looking up, because he can't see\n        anything yet anyway -- naturally, this leads to --\n\n        A head and rock collision. Gabe's head crashes against a new\n        part of the crack, as the passage thins out. He gropes up.\n        The passage is narrowing to the point that he can't get\n        through it. Dead end.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Should've taken that left turn at\n                      Albequerque.\n\n        Gabe backs down, and starts to slide across the side. With\n        his back wedged against the rear wall, he uses his feet to\n        push against the forward wall.\n\n        GABE'S POV - BLACK\n\n        Zero visibility -- Gabe can't see what he's shoving toward.\n        There has never been light of any kind in here.\n\n        GABE\n\n        blindly pushes to the side, rattled by the difficulty of doing\n        this in the dark.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      It's just like any other side move --\n                      you can't see where the fuck you're\n                      going, that's all --\n\n        Gabe stops and fishes out his penlight. Turning it on, it's\n        clear those batteries haven't gotten any more potent in the\n        last few hours. Gabe shines it to the side.\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE LIGHT\n\n        is fading fast. A match's last gasp is brighter.\n\n        GABE\n\n        exasperated, puts the penlight in his mouth and moves on.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (garbled)\n                      Much better.\n\n        Gabe inches on to the side. Looks up to see if the crack has\n        gotten wider. It hasn't. Gabe mumbles something phonetically\n        near \"motherfucker\" around the flashlight, aiming it up --\n\n        GABE'S POV - UP\n\n        No opening larger than a mail slot --\n\n        GABE\n\n        still cursing, still looking up, still moving to the side --\n        he gets the opening he wants, but not where he wants it --\n\n        The crack suddenly, drastically widens as he moves to the\n        side -- since he's been bracing his back against the wall,\n        Gabe falls out of control, twisting around, face down --\n\n        Gabe bounces down the walls for several yards and catches\n        himself by bracing his arms and legs against the crack. It's\n        now five feet wide as he painfully brakes himself --\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE PENLIGHT\n\n        falls out of Gabe's mouth and tumbles down, ping-ponging from\n        one side of the crack to the other as it tumbles a long, long\n        way down -- even after the light is gone, we can still hear\n        the penlight's receding clattering against the walls --\n\n        GABE\n\n        is now, literally, in a jam. There are no handholds, no\n        ledges, and the walls are slick. All he can do is remain\n        braced against the crack's walls until his already sore arms\n        and legs give out.\n\n        EXT. RESCUE HELICOPTER - NEAR BLUFF'S BASE - DAY\n\n        Frank is now flying the helicopter -- a body bag is stashed in\n        the back, and Maggie is in the passenger seat.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                            (motioning down)\n                      Bring it down here.\n\n                                        FRANK\n                      Maggie --\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      Just do it, Frank.\n\n        EXT.

Or Gabe.\n                      Or anybody.\n\n        Maggie runs off into the snow as Frank lifts off. Maggie moves\n        quickly through the snow, and it isn't long before she spots\n        multiple tracks in the snow -- they lead toward, and up, the\n        buttress. Now she's really confused. But with nothing left to\n        do, she starts climbing up the side.\n\n        EXT. WIRE CROSSING - HAL'S POV\n\n        As we've caught Hal in mid-crossing, he's looking from whence\n        he came -- the opposite side of the buttress, where Travers\n        has a gun trained on him --\n\n        HAL\n\n        unhappily hangs high above the ground from the harness kindly\n        provided by Travers --\n\n        HAL'S POV - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIRE\n\n        Kristel is waiting, also with a gun trained on him. Hal\n        arrives and disengages -- the harness is pulled back.\n\n        BUTTRESS SIDE OF WIRE\n\n        Kynette pulls the harness back and hands it to Qualen, who's\n        standing next to Travers.\n\n                                        KYNETTE\n                            (motioning up)\n                      I'm going back.\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                      Look -- this part is nothing,\n                      believe me --\n\n                                        KYNETTE\n                      Walker should be coming up by now.\n\n        Kynette, automatic strapped to his chest, rushes back to the\n        buttress' summit.\n\n        INT. BUTTRESS CRACK/CHIMNEY\n\n        Gabe is just as we left him. Face down, arms and legs pressing\n        against the five-foot gap of the tunnel walls.\n\n        Carefully, Gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his\n        lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look --\n\n        GABE'S POV - UPWARD\n\n        Just as the crack has widened below him -- it's wider above\n        him. More important, it slants at an easy enough angle to\n        allow him to walk up. If only he can get up there.\n\n        GABE\n\n        snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself.\n\n        Gabe steadily \"walks\" up the vertical passage by bracing\n        himself with one leg and one arm -- then moving the other\n        leg and arm up.\n\n        Gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge\n        where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. But there are\n        no handholds that will allow Gabe to get a grip and simply\n        swing over and climb up.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (winded)\n                      So much for the easy part.\n\n        OVERHEAD ANGLE - THE CRACK\n\n        Gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself\n        away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat\n        against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no\n        support at all, and he springs from that all into\n\n        THE DIAGONAL PASSAGE\n\n        Gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts\n        backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and\n        his hands. Safe at last. Gabe carefully stands in a crouch --\n        and starts heading up.\n\n        EXT. BUTTRESS TOP\n\n        Kynette moves to the edge, lies flat, and looks down --\n\n        KYNETTE'S POV - ON THE BUTTRESS SIDE\n\n        Maggie is climbing up, but she's still some way down -- and\n        the hood of her parka has been pulled over her head. All\n        Kynette can see is what she's wearing: an orange parka.\n\n        KYNETTE\n\n        smiles and hits his headset radio.\n\n                                        KYNETTE\n                      He's on the way up.

MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY\n\n        Gabe moves up through the diagonal section -- the crack is\n        starting to go directly upward. Gabe looks up --\n\n        GABE'S POV - TOP OF THE CRACK\n\n        It's coated with snow, but not too much -- Gabe can faintly\n        make out light shining through up there.\n\n        GABE\n\n        knows the top is twenty feet away. Gabe starts up the easy\n        segment, his back braced against one wall.\n\n        EXT.

MOUNTAIN CRACK/CHIMNEY\n\n        Gabe, wedged near the top of the crack, is ready to dig\n        through the snow -- but he hears the sound, muffled and\n        distant, of Kynette talking. Gabe strains to hear -- a bad\n        time to come up? Might be.\n\n        EXT. BUTTRESS SIDE\n\n        Maggie, tired, gets near the top and collapses, resting for a\n        moment, her arms on the edge -- Maggie looks up and is very\n        surprised to see Kynette, standing over her, smiling, his gun\n        aimed down at her.\n\n                                        KYNETTE\n                      Rotten weather for a climb, huh?\n                            (aims barrel)\n                      I have two questions I'd like to\n                      trouble you with.

Maggie gets a good\n        look at Gabe -- his clothes are slashed, he's covered with\n        cuts, and coated with slime and dirt from the crack. He looks\n        like he's just spent a week in Hell. Gabe doesn't react to her\n        reaction -- he just grabs her hand and runs.\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        chooses this moment to show up at the opposite edge -- he\n        fires and automatic BURST at Gabe and Maggie.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Come on --\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      Where? --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Here.\n\n        Gabe jumps on a spot in the snow over the crack, caving it\n        in -- Gabe falls two feet into\n\n        THE CRACK - MAGGIE'S POV\n\n        Gabe has grabbed, and is hanging from, a rope anchored to a\n        piton on the edge of the rock.

Gabe takes a\n        piton and hammer from his belt and hands it to Maggie along\n        with the rope.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Knock this in the side.

It's\n        blurry -- Gabe focuses the binoculars on -- the third\n        bomb, visible on the mountain's edge. The LED counts down,\n        but it's partly obscured.

There's another bomb up\n                      there. We've got to move quick.\n\n        Gabe scans methodically but rapidly down the rock below. All\n        smooth. Until -- Gabe swings the binoculars back. There's a\n        lip ninety feet below, leading into the wall. A cave.\n\n                                        GABE (O.S.)\n                      Good news. There's a cave down there.\n\n        GABE\n\n        puts away the binoculars and swings back to Maggie -- she lets\n        the length of rope drop. It's thirty feet long. Not even\n        almost long enough to get to the shelter. Gabe leans against\n        the crack wall, drained.

Maggie hangs from Gabe's arm,\n        locked in terror -- but skill wins out over fear. She finds a\n        handhold with her free arm, and climbs up to the ledge with\n        Gabe's help. Maggie collapses into Gabe's arms and they fall\n        back against the wall, but Gabe's the one who's really holding\n        on tight.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      That -- tears it.\n                            (gasping)\n                      You're not coming any further.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                            (just as breathless)\n                      Gabe -- you're going to get yourself\n                      killed --\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (breath almost back)\n                      Maybe.

MOUNTAIN WALL/TOWER - HIGH ANGLE - GABE MOVING ON A\n        LEDGE\n\n        that's a little narrower than your coffee table. It's got\n        irregular breaks, causing it to go up or down several feet --\n        and Gabe is jogging it, leaping across the ledge's gaps,\n        leaning toward the wall -- and away from the four thousand\n        foot drop.\n\n        Gabe's gotten his second wind -- he keeps jumping from ledge\n        to ledge with the ease that comes from skill and familiarity,\n        and with renewed purpose. Gabe makes the last jump to a\n        section of ledge near the bottom of\n\n        THE \"BITKER\" LADDER\n\n        which consists of metal rungs woven into loose steel cable\n        bolted into the rock, running two hundred feet to the top --\n        something left behind by a past expedition, now a tourist's\n        toy. And the bottom rung is three feet above Gabe's\n        outstretched arms.\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Hasn't gotten any lower in the last\n                      year.\n                            (coiling for jump)\n                      Bitker, you cheap bastard. Would\n                      another four feet have killed you?\n\n        Gabe leaps up, grabbing the bottom rung instead of a half mile\n        of air, and he shoots up the ladder as we PULL BACK --\n\n        WIDER ANGLE ON MOUNTAIN WALL\n\n        A closer look at terrain seen earlier -- fifty yards away from\n        the ladder, a waterfall is spewing out of the wall, giving the\n        appearance that the mountain has sprung a torrential leak.\n\n        As we track Gabe up the ladder, we can see where the water's\n        coming from -- a whirling lake on top of the mountain. Its\n        constant motion keeps it from totally freezing, but the lake\n        is still coated with a veneer of ice, moving in thick chunks\n        through circular currents on the surface.\n\n        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN SLOPE - HAL AND GANG\n\n        are negotiating the grade, which is slippery, thanks to the\n        fresh, thick snow -- we can see from their relative position\n        to the lake that Gabe has a lead on them. A very slight one.\n\n        TOP OF LADDER - GABE\n\n        pulls himself over and starts running -- as he does, he\n        uproots a big, 3' x 3' park service sign commemorating the\n        \"BITKER CLIMB\" and takes it with him, moving ahead into a\n\n        WOODED AREA\n\n        where Gabe replants the sign near the top of another slope.\n        Gabe heads down towards some rocks -- -- and spots the third\n        case, which took a tough landing on one rock -- it's shattered\n        into halves, and the bands of $5000s are scattered around in\n        the snow.\n\n        Gabe rushes down behind a rock and starts gathering the\n        cash -- soaked by the snow, they've frozen into ice bricks. As\n        Gabe stuffs them into his pack, he's startled by something\n        coming over the rock -- Gabe whirls around to face\n\n        A RABBIT\n\n        that's landed in the snow and looks a lot more frightened than\n        Gabe was. Gabe leans back, relieved. For now.\n\n        EXT. FURTHER UP ON SLOPE - HAL AND GANG\n\n        are closer now -- but as they move down, Hal freezes in place\n        as he sees the \"Bitker\" sign some distance ahead. The sign is\n        out of place. A signal from Gabe -- he is alive. And here.\n\n        Qualen and the others check the monitor. Hal takes the\n        opportunity to back up to a rock formation and swiftly, subtly\n        wedge something into a crack behind his back --\n\n        INSERT - THE OBJECT\n\n        is what Hal lifted off Frank's body -- a speed load cylinder\n        from a revolver, with six fresh bullets in it.\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        checks the monitor -- the relative position shows they're --\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                      Almost there.\n\n        -- but Qualen's grin is wiped away as he looks down at --\n\n        THE MONITOR\n\n        -- the tracer blip is moving -- fast -- away from their\n        position!\n\n        QUALEN'S\n\n        face shifts from incredulity to realization to rage.\n\n        All eyes are on the monitor -- Hal, at the rock formation, has\n        one hand behind his back.\n\n        INSERT - HAL'S HAND\n\n        shakes a box of matches from his sleeve -- he slides a single\n        wooden match halfway out of the pack -- and ignites it with\n        his thumbnail --\n\n        HAL\n\n        moves away from the rock, to draw their attention from what\n        he's been doing --\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Oh, no -- you didn't lose another\n                      one, did you?\n\n        Delmer clicks off his safety and aims at Hal -- Qualen runs\n        into the woods, guided by the monitor -- Kristel follows.\n        Delmer backs Hal up at gunpoint.

Right now.\n\n        ELSEWHERE ON MOUNTAIN - HAL\n\n        tears into a clearing, trying to put some distance between him\n        and Delmer -- as soon as he's out in the open, though,\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        thunders over Hal -- Travers FIRES down at Hal through the\n        doorless pilot's side. Bullets kick up tufts of snow at Hal's\n        heels as he runs down into a steep, sloping wooded area. The\n        tree cover is too thick for Travers to take good aim. Looks\n        like temporary refuge -- but\n\n        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER\n\n        Travers finds a new use for the search copter's heat\n        scope -- using the blip that betrays Hal's body heat as a\n        guide, Travers can still fire down through the trees at\n\n        HAL\n\n        who's still running down the grade -- he hasn't been hit yet,\n        but there's an awful lot of bad luck in the air --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        banks the helicopter around and up for another pass.\n\n        EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MOUNTAIN/TOWER WOODS - QUALEN\n\n        is slogging uphill after his own tracer blip -- which is\n        turning back around and heading towards him. Qualen aims his\n        gun and waits, but at the top of the hill --\n\n        THE RABBIT\n\n        that spooked Gabe earlier sticks its head up for a curious\n        sniff. It has the tracer fastened to its neck with a currency\n        band. Furious, Qualen FIRES at the rabbit -- it safely speeds\n        away as Qualen smashes the useless tracer monitor and turns\n        around.\n\n        EXT.

WOODS - DELMER\n\n        \"replies\", beeping twice on the headset's ear button as he\n        moves downhill into the woods, closely following Hal's\n        tracks -- they lead up to the replanted \"BITKER\" sign. Just\n        big enough to hide behind. Delmer smiles, and advances toward\n        the sign --\n\n        -- and looks behind it. Nothing but a mound of snow. Delmer\n        looks again to the tracks, which lead toward\n\n        A SMALL ROCK FORMATION\n\n        also big enough to conceal Hal. Delmer moves toward it as --\n\n        BEHIND THE \"BITKER\" SIGN\n\n        the mound of snow shifts as Hal climbs out, silently shaking\n        off the cover -- the snow hid him not only from Delmer, but\n        from the heat scope as well --\n\n        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER\n\n        hovers overhead, watching Delmer's blip on the heat scope --\n        but Hal's blip returns, rushing ahead --\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (keying headset radio)\n                      He's right behind you!\n\n        DELMER\n\n        whirls around at the warning, his gun BLAZING, but Hal is too\n        fast -- he swings the sign like a club, knocking Delmer's gun\n        away into the snow. Before Hal can swing again, Delmer\n        brutally punches Hal in the face -- stunned, Hal drops the\n        sign --\n\n        IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS POV\n\n        Travers can't do anything now but watch the heat scope as if\n        it were a video game -- now it's just one big blip --\n\n        DELMER AND HAL\n\n        thrash around in the snow, pummelling each other -- Hal's\n        getting the worst of it, as Delmer manages to get on top of\n        him and deliver a series of punishing blows to his face. Ready\n        to end it, Delmer tries to get the bolt gun off a clip on his\n        front pack strap -- but he has trouble unfastening it. Hal\n        rallies with a solid punch to Delmer's face. Hal gets Delmer\n        off of him and follows with two more.\n\n        Delmer is knocked away, landing on the sign board -- but clear\n        from Hal -- another chance to get the bolt gun off --\n\n        Hal quickly moves to the sign and grabs its post -- before\n        Delmer can move off the sign's board, Hal's running forward.\n        shoving the sign ahead of him with Delmer on top -- Hal lets\n        go, and the sign, with Delmer, sleds downhill on the hard\n        packed snow --\n\n        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER - TRAVERS\n\n        can now see one blip moving quickly away from the other --\n\n                                        TRAVERS\n                            (into radio)\n                      Something's moving fast down the\n                      hill -- is it Tucker?\n\n        HAL\n\n        has found Delmer's fallen headset radio and put it on.\n\n                                        TRAVERS (O.S.)\n                            (over radio)\n                      Answer me!

But the sound of ice-crusted\n        snow CRUNCHING above Gabe alerts him that --\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        has just hit the top of the slope and spotted him -- Qualen's\n        gun BLAZES down --\n\n        GABE\n\n        is on the run, but it's that lead-footed, slow motion stuff\n        that only happens in nightmares -- with every step, a foot\n        breaks through the icy crust and sinks into two feet of\n        snow -- Gabe stays just ahead of the barrage, making it into\n\n        A THICK WOODED AREA\n\n        which is very temporary refuge -- Qualen will be down in\n        seconds. Gabe looks down the slope. Running is impractical. So\n        he sits down.\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        arrives where Gabe was and looks down the slope --\n\n        QUALEN'S POV - GABE\n\n        is whizzing down the slope in a sitting position, using his\n        back and his shoes as gliders, the ice axe as a rudder.\n        Alpinists call this a \"sitting glissade\". Colorado climbers\n        call it \"butt skiing\". Some psychos do this for fun.\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE SLIDE\n\n        is anything but fun -- Gabe can't control his speed or\n        direction well at all -- Gabe barely manages to steer in and\n        out of trees and boulders in his path --\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        starts running down the slope -- he doesn't have speed, but he\n        does have the machine gun -- he FIRES short bursts at --\n\n        GABE\n\n        who tries to steer away from the line of fire -- Gabe is hit\n        in the shoulder -- he slides out of control, and rolls down --\n\n        -- to the slope's bottom. Gabe painfully lifts himself up and\n        moves through the woods, coming out of the trees to\n\n        THE LAKE\n\n        The bridge that spans it is ahead of Gabe -- but there is\n        nothing around but flat terrain.

Hal tosses it\n        aside and checks Delmer's bloody pockets for more weapons.\n        Nothing. Just a couple of machine gun clips, and the bolt gun.\n\n        EXT.

Nowhere to hide. Travers\n        hovers over her, FIRING ahead of her, FIRING behind her, not\n        to kill, just to make a point. He's in charge.\n\n        EXT.

BOTTOM OF THE SLOPE - QUALEN\n\n        moves down to the slope's edge, noting with pleasure the blood\n        in the snow. Gabe is wounded, and he's left a trail as a\n        bonus.\n\n        Qualen moves out lakeside -- nothing visible but the thick,\n        flat ice chunks circling in the currents. But Gabe's\n        footprints and blood lead straight ahead to the bridge.\n\n        Qualen starts to run across the bridge, but stares down --\n\n        QUALEN'S POV - THE BRIDGE'S PLANKS\n\n        The blood -- and slush from Gabe's boots -- end halfway\n        across.\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        Smiles and shakes his head. Too obvious. Gabe is hiding\n        underneath the bridge, in the three foot deep network of steel\n        supports. Qualen slows his pace, staring down through the\n        thin, but visible cracks between the planks.\n\n        TIGHT CLOSE-UP - GABE'S FACE\n\n        grimacing, shivering, ashen from his wound and exertion --\n        lined shadows on his face confirm he is under the bridge.\n\n                                        QUALEN (O.S.)\n                      You've come a long way to die.\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        enjoying himself, slams a fresh clip into his machine gun.\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                      If you were smart, you'd have left\n                      your friend behind. I would have.\n                      There's no shame in staying alive.\n\n        Qualen stops, staring down. Through the gaps, Gabe's parka is\n        visible.

And now you're\n                      going to die from an overdose of\n                      heroism.\n\n        Qualen BLAZES the gun into the planks --\n\n        UNDER THE BRIDGE - GABE\n\n        is clinging to the steel supports of the small bridge,\n        several feet ahead of where his empty parka is being\n        shredded by the FUSILLADE -- without the parka, Gabe is\n        freezing, and too many bullets are coming too close for\n        comfort as they RICOCHET on the bridge's supports --\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        stops firing and kicks away the planks, which are a tangle of\n        toothpicks at this point -- Qualen bends down --\n\n        -- and sees there's nothing in the parka except for Gabe's\n        back. Qualen's face registers anger and surprise as -- -- Gabe\n        appears at the edge of the hole -- before Qualen can react,\n        Gabe swings up with his ice axe, hooking it around the\n        shoulder strap of Qualen's machine gun -- Gabe yanks down,\n        and Qualen falls head first\n\n        UNDER THE BRIDGE\n\n        with Gabe -- Qualen catches himself by hooking an arm and a\n        leg on one of the steel supports -- but both\n\n        THE ICE AXE AND THE GUN\n\n        fall, landing on separate chunks of ice floating underneath\n        the bridge --\n\n        IN THE SUPPORTS\n\n        Gabe pulls himself through the girders to Qualen and punches\n        him with his good arm, but Qualen is unfazed -- neither are in\n        good position, it's like a fistfight on a jungle gym -- --\n        Qualen steadies himself to savagely punch Gabe in his\n        shoulder wound -- Gabe YELLS in pain and tries to block the\n        next one, but Qualen punches him again, and Gabe lets go of\n        the support, falling -- -- on the way down, Gabe grabs\n        Qualen's leg with his good hand -- too low to grab the bridge,\n        Gabe dangles just over the water, raising his legs above it as\n        Qualen tries to kick him off -- -- Gabe holds onto Qualen's\n        leg, and swings on it like a pendulum -- Gabe twists the leg\n        -- Qualen loses his grip on the icy steel and lets go --\n        both\n\n        QUALEN AND GABE\n\n        fall -- they land hard, not in the water, but on a\n        raft-sized chunk of ice driven under the bridge by the\n        current. Their weight teeter-totters the ice as they get up --\n        they're in danger not just from each other, but from\n\n        THE FAST APPROACHING WHIRLPOOL\n\n        where the ice chunks are drawn into the fiercely swirling\n        vortex that drains into the waterfall --\n\n        ON THE ICE RAFT\n\n        Qualen and Gabe circle each other like cautious boxers, as the\n        ice itself swirls in the current -- if either makes the wrong\n        move, they'll both go over. Gabe swings at Qualen, but Qualen\n        throws a leg under Gabe and stiff-arms him down -- Gabe hits\n        the ice hard, his chest hanging over the side -- Qualen moves\n        in to shove him off -- but their combined weight on the same\n        side of the ice starts to tip it over -- Gabe viciously\n        kicks Qualen back, gashing his face with his boot's crampon as\n        Qualen grabs the ice raft's opposite side, levelling it.\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                            (wiping the gash)\n                      Stalemate, isn't it?\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (winded)\n                      Not any more.\n\n        Gabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with\n        Qualen's machine gun is floating by. Gabe snatches up the gun\n        and pulls the trigger. Nothing but an empty CLICK.\n\n                                        QUALEN\n                      Far more intimidating when it's\n                      loaded.\n\n        The chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe\n        grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around,\n        Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at\n        Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away --\n\n        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT\n\n        is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is\n        faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice\n        raft, it will definitely upend it --\n\n        QUALEN AND GABE\n\n        stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen\n        swings out at Gabe with the axe. Gabe ducks and tries to go\n        low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down\n        again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into --\n\n        THE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT\n\n        -- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade --\n\n        GABE\n\n        quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice\n        floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by\n        digging his crampons in -- just as --\n\n        QUALEN\n\n        realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of\n        ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach.\n        Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the\n        other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft\n        disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and\n        tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left --\n\n        -- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn\n        into the vortex --\n\n        GABE\n\n        struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing --\n\n        GABE'S POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN\n\n        Qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as\n        he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond --\n\n        QUALEN'S POV - UNDERWATER\n\n        Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the\n        lake's tunnel drain --\n\n        ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL\n\n        BLASTS OUT full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a\n        half a mile to the ground below!\n\n        GABE\n\n        has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves\n        him moments from the same fate. One more time around, and\n        it's down the drain. Gabe takes a deep breath. No choice. He\n        leaps --\n\n        WIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING\n\n        -- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you\n        would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones\n        big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from\n        sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the\n        ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake --\n\n        GABE\n\n        lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. No choice --\n        Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge\n        supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's\n        weakened -- Gabe slides off, but --\n\n        A HAND\n\n        reaches down and grabs him --\n\n        HAL\n\n        pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge. Gabe's\n        surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's.\n\n                                        HAL\n                            (eyeing Gabe's ruined\n                             shirt)\n                      Nice outfit.\n                            (hands him his parka)\n                      I know you never liked the orange, but\n                      --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear\n                      hats, either.

Travers doesn't even look down -- he just stares at\n        Gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (shouting)\n                      Don't you want to count it?\n\n        Puzzled, Travers takes his gun hand and rips open\n\n        THE PACK\n\n        The $5000s are there -- but they've been shredded by\n        Qualen's earlier blast of gunfire. Few, if any, of the bills\n        are passable.\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        stares down, incredulous -- as he does --\n\n        GABE\n\n        rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt\n        gun from his waist --\n\n        Travers looks up and raises his gun at Gabe -- but Gabe fires\n        first -- the bolt imbeds itself high in Travers' chest.\n        Gasping, Travers drops his gun -- it falls over the pack and\n        out the open door -- Travers clutches at his chest --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Don't spend it all in one place, you\n                      son of a bitch.\n\n        Travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the\n        helicopter -- it spins around, and Gabe has to instantly\n        flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him -- Gabe looks\n        down as --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles --\n        Travers has clearly lost control --\n\n        GABE\n\n        stares down coldly, waiting for the crash -- but --\n\n        INSIDE THE COPTER - TRAVERS\n\n        won't give up -- sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and\n        grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again --\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE HELICOPTER\n\n        stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and\n        up -- with clear purpose --\n\n        CLOSE ON GABE\n\n        eyes widening with realization. Gabe gets up from the spur and\n        starts running back towards the woods -- several hundred yards\n        from safety -- before he can get very far --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        tops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it\n        gets between Gabe and the trees, cutting him off --\n\n        WOODED AREA - HAL AND MAGGIE\n\n        watch, powerless --\n\n                                        HAL\n                      He's going to run Gabe down --\n\n        TRAVERS IN HELICOPTER\n\n        Ashen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and\n        fury as he drives the stick forward --\n\n        TRAVERS POV - GABE\n\n        is stiff-legging it toward the edge of the mountain -- but\n        he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes --\n\n        GABE\n\n        as he throws himself flat into the snow -- the front of the\n        skid misses Gabe by inches as it blasts over him --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        moves out over the precipice edge -- Travers banks it wide to\n        circle back around for another run --\n\n        GABE\n\n        gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him --\n\n        IN A WOODED AREA\n\n        Hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it\n        into one of the ammo clips -- Maggie stays back as he runs for\n        all he's worth out into the clearing --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        has circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the\n        clearing -- Travers intends to not just run Gabe over, but to\n        run him off the edge as well --\n\n        GABE\n\n        lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        knows he has Gabe nailed -- he shoves the stick forward --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        flies forward, skids just inches over the snow --\n\n        HAL\n\n        runs out to where Travers is heading -- he lights the cloth\n        in the ammo clip -- as\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        flies past\n\n        IN THE CLEARING\n\n        Hal hurls the clip, with its cloth \"fuse\" burning down, into\n        the doorless side of the copter --\n\n        INSIDE THE HELICOPTER\n\n        -- the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit --\n        Travers sees it and looks down, but --\n\n        THE \"FUSE\"\n\n        sputters out -- nothing but glowing embers in the cloth --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        smiles -- nothing to worry about -- he speeds ahead --\n\n        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER'S SKIDS\n\n        as they slice through the top of the snow towards --\n\n        GABE\n\n        as he runs toward the mountain's edge -- it's just a couple of\n        feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind --\n\n        -- as the copter overtakes Gabe, dipping even lower into the\n        snow, he dives off the edge --\n\n        FOLLOWING GABE - FALLING\n\n        Gabe is at the ladder -- he falls the first twenty feet of the\n        long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very\n        painfully stopping his fall -- but in the same split second --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        skid meant to impale Gabe catches the top two rungs of the\n        cable ladder --\n\n        WIDE SHOT - THE HELICOPTER\n\n        -- caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter\n        keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable\n        ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place,\n        rung by rung -- -- still going full tilt, the copter strains\n        against the ladder -- thirty feet of it tethers the copter\n        to the wall -- -- and Gabe is dangling from the center of\n        it.\n\n        ON THE LADDER - GABE\n\n        has one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as\n        the copter thrashes the ladder up and down --\n\n        INSIDE THE COPTER\n\n        Travers is disoriented by the jolt, and tries to maintain\n        control -- he doesn't see --\n\n        -- that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited -- it\n        burns down to the clip, and fifty rounds explode like a\n        string of firecrackers --\n\n        -- Travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne\n        lead. Shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes\n        dead -- the rotor blades slow --\n\n        GABE ON LADDER\n\n        Gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor -- if it were\n        possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now --\n\n        ON THE HELICOPTER\n\n        -- as the rotor WHOPS to a dead halt the copter arcs down\n        and slams against the mountain wall -- the skids are still\n        caught in the ladder, and it holds --\n\n        GABE\n\n        is shaken off by the massive impact -- he falls -- --\n        landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the\n        cockpit! As Gabe scrambles for a solid hold --\n\n        INT. HELICOPTER\n\n        -- Travers, who has been shaken to the opposite side of the\n        copter, reaches into his jacket and pulls out the pistol he\n        took from Frank -- he aims at Gabe --\n\n        INSERT - THE HELICOPTER SKID\n\n        One of the two rungs holding the copter up bursts --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        slips, now hanging from just a single rung -- -- and the\n        impact of the slip makes Travers drop the gun -- it falls out\n        the open passenger door. Travers scrambles up through the\n        cabin to go after -- -- Gabe, who is trying to get off the\n        helicopter and onto a solid part of the ladder before the\n        whole thing goes down --           Gabe jumps for the wall as\n        Travers scrambles behind him and --\n\n        CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTER SKID\n\n        -- as the last rung supporting the copter snaps in two --\n\n        GABE\n\n        grabs hold of the ladder as\n\n        THE HELICOPTER\n\n        plummets down -- but as it starts its fall --\n\n        TRAVERS\n\n        leaps from the falling copter and grabs Gabe's leg -- Gabe\n        struggles to support both of them, but Travers, weakened from\n        his wound, loses his grip on Gabe's leg -- he stares up in\n        terror at Gabe as he clutches Gabe's snow-slick boot --\n\n                                        GABE\n                      Cheer up. It's a beautiful spot to\n                      die.\n\n        Travers slides off and away --\n\n        THE FALL - LONG SHOT\n\n        Travers SCREAMING as he free falls, trailing behind the\n        helicopter -- we follow the entire four thousand foot drop --\n\n        -- until the helicopter explodes when it hits the ground far\n        below, and the fireball engulfs Travers just before he\n        impacts into the explosion!\n\n        GABE\n\n        looks down at the burning wreck and clings to the ladder,\n        closing his eyes for a moment in exhaustion. But the WHOPPING\n        of another helicopter makes him look up --\n\n        THE TREASURY HELICOPTER\n\n        has shown up, a little too late to be of any help.\n\n        INSIDE THE TREASURY COPTER\n\n        Wright, Davis and Stuart look at the billowing flames of the\n        wreck -- even from here, the burning money is visible,\n        drifting up in the smoke. Wright turns to Stuart.\n\n                                        WRIGHT\n                      I'm no expert -- but what do you make\n                      of that \"event\"?\n\n        GABE\n\n        is drained -- from somewhere, he finds the strength to lift\n        his head up --\n\n        GABE'S POV - THE WALL\n\n        The section of ladder above him, of course, is gone -- he has\n        to cover the fifty feet of wall above him by free climbing.\n        There are holds that look easy enough for him, but --\n\n        GABE\n\n        leans back, gripping the ladder, too tired to move. Just the\n        thought of one more climb drains him.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (mumbling)\n                      Forget it. No fucking way. I'm staying\n                      right here. I've spent the night on\n                      walls before -- some of the best\n                      nights of my life have been spent\n                      lashed to walls --\n\n        Before Gabe can take this any farther -- a loop tied to the\n        end of a rope falls to a stop next to him. Gabe looks up --\n\n        ON THE EDGE - HAL\n\n        has thrown the line down. Maggie is by his side.\n\n                                        HAL\n                      Remember -- keep your arms and legs in\n                      the vehicle at all times --\n\n        GABE\n\n        puts the loop around himself and tightens it by rote -- even\n        this action aches.\n\n                                        GABE\n                            (too tired to shout)\n                      Fuck you --\n\n        Hal and Maggie draw Gabe up -- Gabe pulls some of his weight\n        by using hand and foot holds, but when he reaches\n\n        THE PRECIPICE EDGE\n\n        Hal and Maggie are both winded from the effort as they haul\n        Gabe onto the top. Gabe unties himself, and collapses into\n        Maggie's lap.\n\n                                        HAL\n                            (winded, coiling the\n                             rope)\n                      Jesus Christ -- you think you could\n                      have put a little less effort into\n                      that climb? I mean, what have you done\n                      for me -- lately?\n\n        Hal ends his harrangue and looks over -- Gabe has apparently\n        revived, because he and Maggie are locked in the kiss of their\n        lives. Hal stands, and smiles -- he walks toward the Treasury\n        agents, who are scrambling out of the helicopter. Hal starts\n        an explanation that's going to take a long, long time as --\n\n        GABE AND MAGGIE\n\n        break off their kiss.\n\n                                        MAGGIE\n                      Does this mean you're staying?\n\n        Off Gabe's answering smile, we --\n\n                                                            FADE OUT.\n\n\n\n\n\nCliffhanger\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael France\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:41.493443"}
