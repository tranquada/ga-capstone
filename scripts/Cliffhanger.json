MOUNTAIN RANGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY\n</b>\n        An unparalleled set of sheer mountains -- part of the Colorado\n        Rockies. The peaks rise a challenging half mile and more out\n        of the valley -- wind-whipped snow mists over the mountains\n        like a low fog. The tranquility is broken as a helicopter\n        BLASTS into view, fighting the wind as it heads for the center\n        of it all.\n\n        Our CREDITS fly us past and through this magnificent range.\n        There are sky-piercing peaks that slope up to a narrow, high\n        pinnacle -- and others that are steel, straight-up approaches\n        to large plateaus. One of the mountains has a crystal lake on\n        top -- with a waterfall that drains from it and exits from the\n        middle of a mountain wall. Nearby, an abandoned cable ladder\n        is bolted into the same wall, leading to the top.\n\n<b>        BACK IN THE HELICOPTER\n</b>\n        We can see a man sitting in its doorway, looking out --\n\n<b>        INT/EXT HELICOPTER - BINOCULAR POV\n</b>\n        The glasses scan systematically, slowly -- to us, it looks\n        like nothing more than a field of gray and white.\n\n<b>                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n</b>                      Nothing yet.\n\n<b>        EXT. THE MOUNTAINS - LONG SHOT\n</b>\n        The helicopter now circles this tallest mountain -- \"The\n        Tower\", separated from a lower but equally formidable peak by\n        a chasm of two hundred feet -- that drops 3,500 feet below.\n\n<b>        INSIDE HELICOPTER - FRANK AND MAGGIE\n</b>\n        Spotter FRANK NEWELL (50s) scans the mountain wall.  MAGGIE\n        DEIGHAN (30s) expertly pilots the helicopter through the storm\n        winds. Both wear orange jackets identifying themselves as\n        members of the Rocky Mountain Park Rescue Team.\n\n<b>                                        FRANK\n</b>                      Wait a minute -- there's Hal.\n                            (beat)\n                      And his date.\n\n<b>        BINOCULAR POV - A LEDGE\n</b>\n        that's part of the smaller peak. HAL TUCKER (30s) and his \n        \"date\", SUSAN COLLINS (20s), are decked out in climbing gear.  \n        Hal's aplomb suggests he's a veteran climber -- Susan's\n        worried look shows she isn't. Hal and Susan huddle together,\n        both cold, but okay. Hal has a makeshift splint wrapped\n        around his lower leg, and a slow burning flare in one hand.\n\n<b>        INSIDE HELICOPTER\n</b>\n        Frank lowers his glasses -- Maggie struggles with the wind.\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE\n</b>                      How do they look?\n\n<b>        BINOCULAR POV - HAL AND SUSAN\n</b>\n        Hal, now aware of the copter, looks towards it, smiling -- and\n        starts jerking off the flare.\n\n<b>                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n</b>                      He's signalling \"okay.\"\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE (O.S.)\n</b>                      Where's Gabe?\n\n        The POV dips down -- there's somebody climbing below, in an\n        orange rescue jacket.\n\n<b>                                        FRANK (O.S.)\n</b>                      Right where he's supposed to be.\n\n<b>        CLOSER ON THE CLIMBER\n</b>\n        This is GABE WALKER (30s). In spite of the cold and the snow,\n        he's fearlessly, swiftly scaling the tower without safety\n        lines, as if he's done it a hundred times. That's because he\n        has done it a hundred times. This is what Gabe lives for.\n\n<b>        ON THE LEDGE\n</b>\n        Gabe, almost there, finds a fingertip-width handhold at arm's\n        length -- grabbing it, he pulls himself up on the ledge with a\n        move that's just a little tougher than chinning yourself on a\n        doorjamb. Winded, Gabe slumps down next to the couple, and\n        tries to light a cigarette. The lighter only sparks.\n\n<b>                                        HAL\n</b>                      Excuse me -- I know you're my\n                      salvation, and all -- do you think you\n                      could rescue us before your smoke\n                      break?\n\n        Hal pulls out a box of wooden matches and lights one Bogart\n        style, one-handed with a thumbnail, cupping a hand to shield\n        it against the wind. Gabe bends down for it -- a familiar\n        routine. We know in a glance they've been friends for years.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Maybe you could tell me why I am\n                      rescuing you.\n\n<b>                                        HAL\n</b>                      Basically -- I've fallen down, and I\n                      can't get up...\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                            (into radio)\n                      Rescue One -- have located helpless\n                      climber, please prepare idiot line\n                      for transport, over --\n\n        THE HELICOPTER dips down towards the ledge -- no way can it\n        land there. Frank lowers a rescue wire to\n\n<b>        GABE\n</b>\n        who precariously swings out from the ledge to grab it -- the\n        wire is just out of reach. Hal grabs the radio.\n\n<b>                                        HAL\n</b>                      Rescue One -- please remind me to tell\n                      you about the time I hauled your hero\n                      here down Mt.

Frank gets\n        out to secure the wire -- there's now a lifeline spanning the\n        chasm.\n\n<b>        ON THE LEDGE\n</b>\n        Gabe finishes anchoring the line in the rock -- he\n        extinguishes his cigarette in the snow, and naturally, pockets\n        the butt. Hal, propped up against the wall, expertly rigs a\n        seat harness around his legs -- Susan helps him get part of it\n        around his splint, and Gabe clips it to the line.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Now, remember -- keep your arms and\n                      legs within the vehicle at all\n                      times --\n\n<b>                                        HAL\n</b>                            (laughing)\n                      Fuck you --\n\n        With that, Hal pulls himself hand-over-hand across the sloping\n        line -- Hal makes a point of looking down --\n\n<b>        HAL'S POV -- THE DROP\n</b>\n        is vertigo defined. Thirty five hundred feet straight down.\n        You could stack the World Trade Center towers on top of each\n        other and they'd still be shorter than this mountain is high.\n        However --\n\n<b>        HAL\n</b>\n        lets go of the overhead line and claps his hands to his face\n        in mock horror -- he quickly whizzes down the last thirty feet\n        of the line, where Frank catches him and pulls him out. Hal\n        gets out of the harness, checks every stitch of it, signals\n        thumbs-up, and sends it back.\n\n<b>        THE LEDGE\n</b>\n        Gabe, retrieves the harness on a small attachment line, and\n        gives Susan a reassuring smile, but she's still, sensibly,\n        very scared. Gabe recovers the harness, rigs Susan into it,\n        and meticulously re-checks it.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Ready?\n                            (sees she's afraid)\n                      Did he tell you about the time he\n                      almost made it up Everest?\n\n<b>                                        SUSAN\n</b>                      He said you gave him a bad oxygen mask\n<b>                      --\n</b>\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Well, if he's bored you with that\n                      bullshit, then this has to be the best\n                      part of a bad date.

SHED - DAY\n</b>\n       Not a storage shed at all -- it's a small workspace that\n       offers solid protection from the elements, is well-lit, and\n       whistle-clean. Maggie, in front of a table, pulls a cover off.\n\n<b>       A LARGE PLASTIC CAGE\n</b>\n       -- inside is a bald eagle. One of maybe 2,000 left in the\n       country. Its uneven feathering and small, gawky size tells us\n       it isn't nearly full grown. A bandage on its side tells us\n       it's been injured. Maggie's smile tells us it's healing.\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE\n</b>                      Hey there --\n\n       The door to the shed opens -- Gabe steps in, and shuts the\n       door behind him. Maggie looks surprised to see him. Gabe just\n       looks awkward.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Hi.\n                           (beat)\n                      Could you introduce us?\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE\n</b>                      Sure.

This is clearly something they've done\n       many times before. They move together, tight -- Gabe and\n       Maggie both react to this bit of close contact as they bandage\n       the eagle. It's getting warmer in here. Gabe reaches down and\n       yanks off the patch. The eagle thrashes as Gabe cleans the\n       wound.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      Got some fight in her -- that's good.\n                           (beat)\n                      What happened to Dave?\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE\n</b>                      The usual.

Maggie puts the eagle back\n       in the cage and closes the top door. Gabe and Maggie don't\n       move any further apart as they pull their gloves off. Gabe\n       tentatively reaches for Maggie's face -- but she pushes him\n       hand away.\n\n<b>                                        MAGGIE\n</b>                      I'm glad to see you, Gabe.

Worse,\n        the rest of the mountain bulges outward in a curve, making\n        climbing almost impossible.\n\n<b>        ON THE LEDGE\n</b>\n        Travers holds his gun on Gabe, and motions up\n\n<b>                                        TRAVERS \n</b>                      Fetch.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                      I'll need the ice axe.\n\n<b>                                        TRAVERS\n</b>                            (laughs)\n                      You've got to be kidding.\n\n<b>                                        GABE\n</b>                            (sighs)\n                      Okay.

Gabe fastens them to his boots.\n\n        Gabe looks up -- this is going to be tough, even for him. In\n        spite of the cold, he takes off his gloves -- that's how small\n        these holds are -- and he meticulously tapes up his hands and\n        his fingers.\n\n<b>        HIGH ANGLE - GABE\n</b>\n        moves up the wall with some ease at first -- there are\n        hand-sized handholds, and decent footholds -- but twenty feet\n        up, there's nothing. To keep going, Gabe has to painfully\n        wedge his fingers into small cracks, essentially supporting\n        his weight only by several fingerholds at any given moment.\n        We can see from the angle that Gabe is at least 3,000 feet\n        from solid ground.

He is moving up\n        the underside of the overhang and is essentially hanging\n        upside down, knifing his fingers into tiny cracks for support.\n        It's excruciating -- both in terms of muscular effort, and the\n        abrasions that come from forcing fingers into ice and rock\n        again and again.

Gabe\n        takes his handheld crampon and hammers it into the ice\n        overhead with more force than usual. This one is going to have\n        to hold.\n\n        Gabe steels himself for a tough move -- with one hand gripping\n        that crampon, he swings out, away from the wall.\n\n        Only the crampon spikes jammed into the ice above his hand\n        are keeping Gabe from falling. Gabe needs the second crampon\n        to make the move up -- but that's not going to be easy to get.\n        It's attached to his boot.\n\n        As Gabe clings to the upper crampon, his body swaying, he\n        reaches down with his free hand to loosen the other crampon.\n\n<b>        GABE'S POV - DOWN\n</b>\n        The ground is one slip and five thousand feet away.

It doesn't hold -- but the force of\n        Gabe's swing, pushing him away, has loosened the other\n        crampon. Gabe only gets one more shot at this -- he swings\n        the free crampon up with all his might -- it catches in the\n        same split second as the other dislodges.\n\n        But the hard part is over -- with the two crayons, Gabe\n        quickly manages to climb up over the lip of\n\n<b>        THE ICE OVERHANG\n</b>\n        This is a field of ice sloping up to the top. Gabe pulls\n        himself a few feet away from the edge, and puts the crampons\n        back on his feet where they belong. It's now pretty simple for\n        Gabe to run up the ice slope three hundred yards to\n\n<b>        THE SUMMIT\n</b>\n        which is a rocky, wooded area. Gabe seems to have a second\n        wind now -- he runs to the other side of the summit.

This is lower down from the\n        summit -- it's solid and treeless.\n\n        Hal and the rest of the expedition is totally exposed as they\n        climb in single file up to the top.

But Gabe moves closer to\n        the bluff's base -- Gabe shoves through some trees to the\n        beginning of\n\n<b>        THE \"CHIMNEY\"\n</b>\n        A crevice runs the entire length and breadth of the bluff.\n\n<b>        GABE\n</b>\n        pulls out his ancient binoculars, and scans the crack.\n\n<b>        GABE'S POV - THE CHIMNEY\n</b>\n        Starting with an outside view, we can see that the crevice\n        runs all the way up, and through, the bluff -- but it's a\n        zig-zag, not a straight line.\n\n        Picture a mine shaft designed by a madman. The crack moves\n        upward, then erratically to the side, then straight up again.\n        The width of the crack is uneven, ranging from six inches to\n        six feet. And that's just how it looks on the outside.\n        There's no telling what the interior is like.\n\n        Gabe turns the binoculars to the inside of the crack. It's\n        hard to see much -- it's very, very dark. But it looks as if\n        the crack goes all the way through the bluff, as well as all\n        the way up it. On this route, Gabe can tunnel through the\n        mountain instead of going up the side.\n\n<b>        GABE\n</b>\n        puts away the binoculars and wedges himself into the crack,\n        starting the long process of going up -- and through -- the\n        mountain formation.\n\n<b>        EXT.
