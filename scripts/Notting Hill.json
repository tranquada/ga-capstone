VARIOUS DAYS\n</b>\n  'She' plays through the credits.\n\n  Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our\n  time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of\n  glamour and sophistication and mystery.\n\n<b>  EXT. STREET - DAY\n</b>\n  Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We\n  follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of\n  bread.  It is spring.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    Of course, I've seen her films and\n    always thought she was, well,\n    fabulous -- but, you know,\n    million miles from the world I live\n    in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill\n    -- not a bad place to be...\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n  It's a full fruit market day.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    There's the market on weekdays,\n    selling every fruit and vegetable\n    known to man...\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n  A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    The tattoo parlour -- with a guy\n    outside who got drunk and now can't\n    remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    The racial hair-dressers where\n    everyone comes out looking like the\n    Cookie Monster, whether they like\n    it or not...\n\n  Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    Then suddenly it's the weekend, and\n    from break of day, hundreds of stalls\n    appears out of nowhere, filling\n    Portobello Road right up to Notting\n    Hill Gate...\n\n  A frantic crowded Portobello market.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    ... and thousands of people buy\n    millions of antiques, some genuine...\n\n  The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained\n  glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes\n  and saints.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    ... and some not so genuine.\n\n<b>  EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    And what's great is that lots of\n    friends have ended up in this part of\n    London -- that's Tony, architect\n    turned chef, who recently invested\n    all the money he ever earned in a new\n    restaurant...\n\n  Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,\n  the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge\n  fresh salmon.\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    So this is where I spend my days\n    and years -- in this small village in\n    the middle of a city -- in a house\n    with a blue door that my wife and I\n    bought together... before she left\n    me for a man who looked like Harrison\n    Ford, only even handsomer...\n\n  We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    ... and where I now lead a strange\n    half-life with a lodger called...\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Spike!\n\n  The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-\n  bachelor flat.\n\n  Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual\n  hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very\n  white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears\n  only shorts.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me\n    with an incredibly important\n    decision, could you?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    This is important in comparison to,\n    let's say, whether they should\n    cancel third world debt?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    That's right -- I'm at last going out\n    on a date with the great Janine and I\n    just want to be sure I've picked the\n    right t-shirt.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    What are the choices?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Well... wait for it...\n      (He pulls on a t-shirt)\n    First there's this one...\n\n  The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien\n  coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love\n  Blood.'\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- might make it hard to strike a\n    really romantic note.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Point taken.\n\n  He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    I suspect you'll prefer the next one.\n\n  And he re-enters in a white t-shirt, with a large arrow,\n  pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Cool, huh?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- she might think you don't have\n    true love on your mind.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Wouldn't want that...\n      (and back up he goes)\n    Okay -- just one more.\n\n  He comes down wearing it.  Lots of hearts, saying, 'You're the\n  most beautiful woman in the world.'\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Well, yes, that's perfect. Well\n    done.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Good luck.\n\n  Spike turns and walks upstairs proudly.  Revealing that on the\n  back of the t-shirt, also printed in big letters, is written\n  'Fancy a fuck?'\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    And so it was just another hopeless\n    Wednesday, as I set off through the\n    market to work, little suspecting\n    that this was the day which would\n    change my life forever.  This is\n    work, by the way, my little travel\n    book shop...\n\n  A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'\n\n<b>        WILLIAM (V.O.)\n</b>    ... which, well, sells travel books\n    -- and, to be frank with you, doesn't\n    always sell many of those.\n\n  William enters.\n\n<b>  INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY\n</b>\n  It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,\n  with little secret bits round corners with even more books.\n  Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.\n  He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without\n  cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the\n  desk.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Classic.  Absolutely classic.\n    Profit from major sales push -- minus\n    $B!r(J347.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the\n    pain.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes, better get me a half.  All I can\n    afford.\n\n<b>        MARIN\n</b>    I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.\n\n  He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.\n  We only just glimpse her.\n\n  Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees\n  something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Can I help you?\n\n  It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --\n  in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.\n  When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No, thanks.  I'll just look around.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Fine.\n\n  She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a\n  quite smart coffee table book.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    That book's really not good -- just\n    in case, you know, browsing turned to\n    buying.  You'd be wasting your money.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Really?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes.  This one though is... very\n    good.\n\n  He picks up a book on the counter.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I think the man who wrote it has\n    actually been to Turkey, which helps.\n    There's also a very amusing incident\n    with a kebab.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Thanks.  I'll think about it.\n\n  William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor\n  beside him.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    If you could just give me a second.\n\n  Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and\n  approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Excuse me.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Yes.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Bad news.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    What?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    We've got a security camera in this\n    bit of the shop.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    So?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    So, I saw you put that book down your\n    trousers.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    What book?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    The one down your trousers.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    I haven't got a book down my trousers.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right -- well, then we have something\n    of an impasse.  I tell you what --\n    I'll call the police -- and,  what can\n    I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole\n    book-down-the-trousers scenario, I\n    really apologize.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Okay -- what if I did have a book down\n    my trousers?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Well, ideally, when I went back to\n    the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan\n    guide to Bali from your trousers, and\n    either wipe it and put it back, or\n    buy it.  See you in a sec.\n\n  He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does\n  William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the\n  shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has\n  observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Sorry about that...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No, that's fine.  I was going to\n    steal one myself but now I've changed\n    my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you\n    can find an unsigned copy, it's\n    worth an absolute fortune.\n\n  She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Excuse me.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Can I have your autograph?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What's your name?\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Rufus.\n\n  She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    What does it say?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Well, that's the signature -- and\n    above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you\n    belong in jail.'\n\n<b>        THIEF\n</b>    Nice one.  Would you like my phone\n    number?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Tempting but... no, thank you.\n\n  Thief leaves.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I think I will try this one.\n\n  She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.\n  He talks as he handles the transaction.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh -- right -- on second thoughts\n    maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually\n    -- it's a sort of masterpiece really.\n    None of those childish kebab\n    stories you get in so many travel\n    books these days.  And I'll throw in\n    one of these for free.\n\n  He drops in one of the signed books.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Very useful for lighting fires,\n    wrapping fish, that sort of things.\n\n  She looks at him with a slight smile.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Thanks.\n\n  And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little\n  dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Cappuccino as ordered.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe\n    who was just in here.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Who?  Someone famous?\n\n  But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No. No-one -- no-one.\n\n  They set about drinking their coffees.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Would be exciting if someone famous\n    did come into the shop though,\n    wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is\n    pretty incredible actually -- I once\n    saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think\n    it was Ringo.  It might have been\n    that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'\n    Toppy.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Topol.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    That's right -- Topol.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    But Ringo Starr doesn't look\n    anything like Topol.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    No, well... he was quite a long way\n    away.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    So it could have been neither of them?\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    I suppose so.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,\n    is it?\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Not classic, no.\n\n  Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.\n\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right -- want another one?\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --\n    I'll have an orange juice.\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n  William sets off.\n\n<b>  INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n</b>\n  William collects his juice in a coffee shop on Westbourne Park\n  Road.\n\n<b>  EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY\n</b>\n  William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of\n  Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange\n  juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Oh Jesus.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Here, let me help.\n\n  He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting\n  far too near her breasts in the panic of it...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What are you doing?!\n\n  He jumps back.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just\n    over the street -- you could get\n    cleaned up.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No thank you.  I need to get my car\n    back.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I also have a phone.  I'm confident\n    that in five minutes we can have you\n    spick and span and back on the street\n    again... in the non-prostitute sense\n    obviously.\n\n  In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being\n  genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Okay.  So what does 'just over the\n    street' mean -- give it to me in yards.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Eighteen yards.  That's my house\n    there.\n\n  He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.\n  She looks up at him.\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n  They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Come on in.  I'll just...\n\n  William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes\n  under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of\n  breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It's not that tidy, I fear.\n\n  And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books\n  from her...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    The bathroom is right at the top of\n    the stairs and there's a phone on the\n    desk up there.\n\n  She heads upstairs.\n\n<b>  INT. KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n  William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on\n  the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black\n  top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He\n  is dazzled by the sight of her.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Would you like a cup of tea before\n    you go?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No thanks.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Coffee?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Orange juice -- probably not.\n\n  He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Something else cold -- coke, water,\n    some disgusting sugary drink\n    pretending to have something to do\n    with fruits of the forest?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Really, no.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Would you like something to nibble --\n    apricots, soaked in honey -- quite\n    why, no one knows -- because it stops\n    them tasting of apricots, and makes\n    them taste like honey, and if you\n    wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,\n    instead of apricots, but nevertheless\n    -- there we go -- yours if you want\n    them.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Do you always say 'no' to everything?\n\n  Pause.  She looks at him deep.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No.\n      (pause)\n    I better be going.  Thanks for your\n    help.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    You're welcome and, may I also say...\n    heavenly.\n\n  It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-\n  talking man.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Take my one chance to say it.  After\n    you've read that terrible book,\n    you're certainly not going to be\n    coming back to the shop.\n\n  She smiles.  She's cool.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Thank you.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.\n\n  He guides her towards the door.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.\n\n  In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He\n  closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    'Surreal but nice.'  What was I\n    thinking?\n\n  ... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along\n  the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves\n  back, casually...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Coming.\n\n  He opens the door.  It's her.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh hi.  Forget something?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I forgot my bag.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh right.\n\n  He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping\n  bag.  Then returns and hands it to her.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Here we go.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Thanks.  Well...\n\n  They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time\n  saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans\n  forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the\n  strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'\n    comment.  Disaster...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Don't worry about it.  I thought the\n    apricot and honey business was the\n    real lowpoint.\n\n  Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --\n    there's no excuse for him.\n\n  Spike walks in.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Hi.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Hi.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Hi.\n\n  Spike walks past unsuspiciously and heads into the kitchen.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    I'm just going to go into the kitchen\n    to get some food -- and then I'm going\n    to tell you a story that will make your\n    balls shrink to the size of raisins.\n\n  And leaves them in the corridor.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Probably best not tell anyone about\n    this.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell\n    myself sometimes but... don't worry\n    -- I won't believe it.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Bye.\n\n  And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike\n  comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a\n  styrofoam container with a spoon.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    There's something wrong with this\n    yogurt.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Well, there you go.\n      (takes another big spoonful)\n    On for a video fest tonight?  I've\n    got some absolute classic.\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The lights are off.  William and Spike on the couch, just the\n  light from the TV playing on their faces.  Cut to the TV full\n  screen.  There is Anna.  She is in a stylish Woody Allen type\n  modern romantic comedy, 'Gramercy Park,' in black and white.\n\n<b>  INT. MANHATTAN ART GALLERY - DAY\n</b>\n  Anna's character -- Woody Anna -- is walking around the gallery\n  with her famous co-star, Michael.  They should be the perfect\n  couple, but there is tension.  Anna is not happy.\n\n<b>        MICHAEL\n</b>    Smile.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No.\n\n<b>        MICHAEL\n</b>    Smile.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I've got nothing to smile about.\n\n<b>        MICHAEL\n</b>    Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to\n    ask you to marry me.\n\n  And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles.\n\n<b>  INT.

How about that new John\n    Grisham thriller?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, that's a novel too.\n\n<b>        MR. SMITH\n</b>    Oh right.

At that moment the entire window is suddenly\n  taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and\n  entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film,\n  'Helix.'\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing\n  full body scuba diving gear.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Hey.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Hi...\n\n<b>  INT.

Vicious circle.  And then I was\n    like rooting around in your things,\n    and found this, and I thought -- cool.\n    Kind of spacey.\n\n<b>  EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY\n</b>\n  The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.\n  William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and\n  the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather\n  wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    There's something wrong with the\n    goggles though...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, they were prescription, so I could\n    see all the fishes properly.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Groovy.

That's it?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    You want me to write down all your\n    messages?\n\n  William closes his eyes in exasperation.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Who were the ones you didn't write\n    down from?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Ahm let's see -- ahm.

No one else?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Absolutely not.\n\n  Spike leans back and relaxes.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Though if we're going for this\n    obsessive writing-down-all-messages\n    thing -- some American girl called\n    Anna called a few days ago.\n\n  William freezes -- then looks at Spike.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    What did she say?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Well, it was genuinely bizarre...\n    she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then\n    she said, call me at the Ritz -- and\n    then gave herself a completely\n    different name.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Which was?\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one\n    name's bad enough...\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  William on the phone.  We hear the formal man at the other end of\n  the phone.  And then intercut with him.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Hello.\n\n<b>        RITZ MAN (V.O.)\n</b>    May I help you, sir?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Ahm, look this is a very odd\n    situation.

She\n    said she's using another name -- but\n    the problem is she left the message\n    with my flatmate, which was a serious\n    mistake.\n\n<b>  INT.

We,\n    ahm I work in a bookshop.\n\n<b>        ANNA (V.O.)\n</b>    You played it pretty cool here,\n    waiting for three days to call.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, I've never played anything cool\n    in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll\n    stab to death later, never gave me the\n    message.\n\n<b>        ANNA (V.O.)\n</b>    Oh -- Okay.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Perhaps I could drop round for tea or\n    something?\n\n<b>        ANNA (V.O.)\n</b>    Yeh -- unfortunately, things are\n    going to be pretty busy, but... okay,\n    let's give it a try.  Four o'clock\n    could be good.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.  Great.\n      (he hangs up)\n    Classic.  Classic.\n\n<b>  EXT. RITZ - DAY\n</b>\n  William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a\n  small bunch of roses.\n\n<b>  INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY\n</b>\n  He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and\n  the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young\n  man.  His name is Tarquin.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Which floor?\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    Three.\n\n  William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close.\n\n<b>  INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n  The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms\n  30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right.\n  So does Tarquin.\n\n  William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So\n  does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points\n  at the number.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Are you sure you...?\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    Yes.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh.  Right.\n\n  He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things\n    are running a bit late.  Here's the\n    thing...\n\n  She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits,\n  with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.'\n\n<b>  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There\n  are a number of journalists waiting for their audience.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    What did you think of the film?\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    Marvellous.  'Close Encounters'\n    meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar-\n    winning stuff.\n\n  They both turn to William for his opinion.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I agree.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    I'm sorry.

I'll check.\n\n  They sit down as Karen goes off.\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    You've brought her flowers?\n\n  William goes for the cover-up.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No -- they're... for my grandmother.\n    She's in a hospital nearby.  Thought\n    I'd kill two birds with one stone.\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    I'm sorry.  Which hospital?\n\n  Pause.  He's in trouble.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Do you mind me not saying -- it's a\n    rather distressing disease and the\n    name of the hospital rather gives it\n    away.\n\n<b>        TARQUIN\n</b>    Oh sure.  Of course.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    Mr. Thacker.\n\n  Saved by the bell.\n\n<b>  INT. TRAFALGAR SUIT CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    You've got five minutes.\n\n  He is shown in through big golden doors.  Karen stays outside.\n\n<b>  INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE SITTING ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  There Anna is, framed in the window.  Glorious.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Hi.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Hello.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I brought these, but clearly...\n\n  There are lots of other flowers in the room.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Oh no, ho -- these are great.\n\n  A fair amount of tension.  These two people hardly know each\n  other -- and the first and last time they met, they kissed.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Sorry about not ringing back.  The\n    whole two-names concept was totally too\n    much for my flatman's pea-sized\n    intellect.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I\n    always choose a cartoon character --\n    last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.\n\n  At which moment Jeremy, Karen's boss, comes in.  A fairly grave,\n  authoritative fifty-year-old PR man consulting a list.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Everything okay?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes, thanks.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    And you are from 'Horse and Hound'\n    magazine?\n\n  William nods.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Is that so?\n\n  William shrugs his shoulders.  Jeremy settles at a little desk\n  in the corner and makes notes.  A pause.  William feels he has to\n  act the part.  They sit in chairs opposite each other.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    So I'll just fire away, shall I?\n\n  Anna nods.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.  Ahm... the film's great...\n    and I just wondered -- whether you\n    ever thought of having more...\n    horses in it?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to\n    -- but it was difficult, obviously,\n    being set in space.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Obviously.  Very difficult.\n\n  Jeremy leaves.\n\n  William puts his head in his hands.  He was panic.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they\n    thrust this thing into my hand -- I\n    didn't know what to do.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No, it's my fault, I thought this\n    would all be over by now.  I just\n    wanted to sort of apologize for the\n    kissing thing.  I seriously don't\n    know what got in to me.  I just wanted\n    to make sure you were fine about it.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Absolutely fine about it.\n\n  Re-enter Jeremy.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Do remember that Miss Scott is also\n    keen to talk about her next project,\n    which is shooting later in the summer.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses\n    in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our\n    readers are equally intrigued by both\n    species.\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    It takes place on a submarine.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes.  Right... But if there were horses,\n    would you be riding them yourself or\n    would you be getting a stunt horse person\n    double sort of thing?\n\n  Jeremy exits.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry.\n    This is the sort of thing that happens\n    in dreams -- not in real life.  Good\n    dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to\n    see you.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    And what happens next in the dream?\n\n  It's a challenge.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Well, I suppose in the dream dream\n    scenario.  I just... ahm, change my\n    personality, because you can do that\n    in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the\n    girl but you know it'll never happen.\n\n  Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy\n  enters.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was\n    so short.  Did you get what you wanted?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Very nearly.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Maybe time for one last question?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.\n\n  Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Are you busy tonight?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes.\n\n  They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists\n  in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Well, it was nice to meet you.\n    Surreal but nice.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Thank you.

'Ooh -- careful there,\n    vicar.'

Anna\n  watches William laughing at something and then putting his head\n  in his hands with mock shame.\n\n<b>  INT.

I'm going to give the\n    last brownie as a prize to the saddest\n    act here.\n\n  A little pause.  Then William turns to Bernie.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Bernie.\n\n<b>        BERNIE\n</b>    Well, obviously it's me, isn't it --\n    I work in the City in a job I don't\n    understand and everyone keeps getting\n    promoted above me.  I haven't had a\n    girlfriends since... puberty and,\n    well, the long and short of it is,\n    nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks\n    get any chubbier, they never will.\n\n<b>        HONEY\n</b>    Nonsense.  I fancy you.  Or I did\n    before you got so far.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    You see -- and unless I'm much mistaken,\n    your job still pays you rather a lot of\n    money, while Honey here, she earns\n    nothing flogging her guts out at\n    London's seediest record store.\n\n<b>        HONEY\n</b>    Yes.  And I don't have hair -- I've got\n    feathers, and I've got funny goggly\n    eyes, and I'm attracted to cruel men and\n    ... no one'll ever marry me because my\n    boosies have actually started\n    shrinking.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    You see -- incredibly sad.\n\n<b>        BELLA\n</b>    On the other hand, her best friend is\n    Anna Scott.\n\n<b>        HONEY\n</b>    That's true, I can't deny it.  She\n    needs me, what can I say?\n\n<b>        BELLA\n</b>    And most of her limbs work.  Whereas\n    I'm stuck in its thing day and night,\n    in a house full of ramps.  And to add\n    insult to serious injury -- I've\n    totally given up smoking, my favourite\n    thing, and the truth is... we can't\n    have a baby.\n\n  Dead silence.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Bella.\n\n  Bella shrugs her shoulders.  Bernie is totally grief-struck.\n\n<b>        BERNIE\n</b>    No.  Not true...\n\n<b>        BELLA\n</b>    C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots\n    of ways, but... Surely it's worth a\n    brownie.\n\n  William reaches for her hand.  Max breaks the sombre mood.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Well, I don't know.  Look at\n    William.  Very unsuccessful\n    professionally.  Divorced.  Used to\n    be handsome, now kind of squidgy\n    around the edges -- and absolutely\n    certain never to hear from Anna again\n    after she's heard that his nickname\n    at school was Floppy.\n\n  They all laugh.  Anna smiles across at William.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    So I get the brownie?\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    I think you do, yes.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Wait a minute.  What about me?\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the\n    brownie?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Well... a shot at it.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    You'll have to prove it.  This is a\n    great brownie and I'm going to fight\n    for it.  State your claim.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Well, I've been on a diet since I was\n    nineteen, which means basically I've\n    been hungry for a decade.  I've had a\n    sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one\n    of whom hit me: and every time my heart\n    gets broken it gets splashed across\n    the newspapers as entertainment.\n    Meantime, it cost millions to get me\n    looking like this...\n\n<b>        HONEY\n</b>    Really?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Really -- and one day, not long from\n    now...\n\n  While she says this, quiet settles around the table.  The thing\n  is -- she sort of means it and is opening up to them.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    ... my looks will go, they'll find out\n    I can't act and I'll become a sad\n    middle-aged woman who looks a bit like\n    someone who was famous for a while.\n\n  Silence... they all look at her... then.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Nah!!!  Nice try, gorgeous -- but you\n    don't fool anyone.\n\n  The mood is instantly broken.  They all laugh.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.\n\n<b>  INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Anna and William are leaving.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    That was such a great evening.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    I'm delighted.\n\n  He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek.\n  He stumbles back with joy.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Now you're lying.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You're right.  I told you I was bad\n    at acting.\n\n  Max loves this.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>      (to Bella)\n    Lovely to meet you.\n\n<b>        BELLA\n</b>    And you.

Bernie tries to save some dignity.\n\n<b>        BERNIE\n</b>    Love your work.\n\n  They move to the door and wave goodbye.\n\n<b>  EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive\n  and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true\n  feelings.  William is a little embarrassed.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Sorry -- they always do that when I\n    leave the house.\n\n  The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.\n  They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Floppy, huh?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It's the hair!  It's to do with the\n    hair.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Why is she in a wheelchair?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It was an accident -- about eighteen\n    months ago.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    And the pregnancy thing -- is that to\n    do with the accident?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    You know, I'm not sure.  I don't\n    think they'd tried for kids before,\n    as fate would have it.\n\n  They walk in silence for a moment.  Then...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Would you like to come... my house is\n    just...?\n\n  She smiles and shakes her head.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Too complicated.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    That's fine.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Busy tomorrow?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I thought you were leaving.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I was.\n\n<b>  EXT.

All these streets round\n    here have these mysterious communal\n    gardens in the middle of them.\n    They're like little villages.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Let's go in.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Ah no -- that's the point -- they're\n    private villages -- only the people\n    who live round the edges are allowed\n    in.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You abide by rules like that?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Ahm...\n\n  Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on\n  the answer to this.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Heck no -- other people do -- but not\n    me -- I just do what I want.\n\n  He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite\n  make it, and falls back onto the pavement...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>      (casually)\n    Whoopsidaisies.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What did you say?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Nothing.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes, you did.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, I didn't.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You said 'whoopsidaisies.'\n\n  Tiny pause.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I don't think so.  No one has said\n    'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean\n    unless they're...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    There's no 'unless.'  No one has said\n    \"whoopsidaisies\" for fifty years and\n    even then it was only little girls\n    with blonde ringlets.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Exactly.  Here we go again.\n\n  He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Whoopsidaisies.\n\n  They look at each other.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It's a disease I've got -- it's a\n    clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and\n    having injections -- it won't last\n    long.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Step aside.\n\n  She starts to climb.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Actually be careful Anna -- it's\n    harder than it looks...\n\n  But she's already almost over.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh no it's not -- it's easy.\n\n  A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Come on, Flops.\n\n  William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself\n  off, and heads towards where she stands.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Now seriously -- what in the world\n    in this garden could make that\n    ordeal worthwhile?\n\n  She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first\n  time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Nice garden.\n\n<b>  EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT\n</b>\n  They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see\n  the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come\n  across a single, simple wooden bench.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    'For June, who loved this garden --\n    from Joseph who always sat beside\n    her.'\n\n  We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She\n  doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917\n  - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Some people do spend their whole\n    lives together.\n\n  He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench,\n  looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up\n  into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music\n  plays.\n\n<b>  INT.

Average day, my glasses are\n    everywhere -- everywhere I look,\n    glasses.  But the moment I need them\n    they disappear.  It's one of life's\n    real cruelties.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    That's compared to, like,\n    earthquakes in the Far East or\n    testicular cancer?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh shit, is that the time?

And there is in the\n  middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to\n  her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba-\n  diving goggles.\n\n<b>  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William\n  sitting, near the end of their meal.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    So who left who?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    She left me.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Why?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    She saw through me.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Uh-oh.

She takes a\n  helmet type thing, and places it on her head.\n\n<b>  INT. CONNECT CINEMA - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Cut round to the Coronet cinema where this film is showing.\n  It's not full.  The camera moves and finds, sitting on his\n  own...William.  Just watching.  We see a momentous flash of\n  light from the screen explode, reflected in his eye.\n\n<b>  INT.

Speak on, dear friend.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    She's someone I just can't -- someone\n    who... self-evidently can't be mine --\n    and it's as if I've taken love-heroin\n    -- and now I can't even have it again.\n    I've opened Pandora's box.

The hair,\n    I admit, is unfashionable frizzy --\n    but she's as bright as a button and\n    kisses like a nymphomaniac on death\n    row.  Apparently.\n\n<b>  INT.

We stay with William\n  -- and just hear the door open and a voice come down the\n  corridor.\n\n<b>        TESSA (V.O.)\n</b>    I got completely lost -- it's real\n    difficult, isn't it?

Honey, Bella, William and another\n  girl.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Keziah -- some woodcock?\n\n<b>        KEZIAH\n</b>    No, thank you  -- I'm a fruitarian.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    I don't realize that.\n\n  It is left to William, who has been set up here, to fill the\n  pause.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    And ahm -- what's a fruitarian exactly?\n\n<b>        KEZIAH\n</b>    We believe that fruits and vegetables\n    have feelings so we think cooking is\n    cruel.  We only eat things that have\n    actually fallen from the tree or bush\n    -- that are, in fact, dead already.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right.  Right.

She is also\n  dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her\n  briefcase with law books from the kitchen table.\n\n<b>  EXT.

We see,\n  though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem\n  to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front\n  page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'\n  and 'Scott of Pantartica.'\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  William is shaving.  The bell goes.

It's not Jane Austen, it's\n    not Henry James, but it's gripping.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You think I should do Henry James\n    instead?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.\n    But, you know -- this writer's pretty\n    damn good too.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone\n    in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve\n    to say 'inform the Pentagon that we\n    need black star cover.'\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    And I think the book is the poorer for\n    it.\n\n  Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.

There's a picture\n  hanging on the wall behind.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I can't believe you have that picture\n    on your wall.\n\n  It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple,\n  with a goat as company.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    You like Chagall?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I do.

But nothing\n  happens.  William gets off the sofa decisively.  Sits on the\n  side of it.  Then gets back in again.\n\n  Pause, pause, then... in the darkness, a stair creaks.  There's\n  someone there.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>      (to himself)\n    Oh my God...\n      (then...)\n    Hello.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Hello.

WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of\n  the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a\n  miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then\n  he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who\n  it is.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Wow.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What?\n\n  And then gets over it straight away.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Nothing.\n\n  And kisses her.\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n  The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart.\n  In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then\n  she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right\n  next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this\n  all is.\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  The morning.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    It still strikes me as, well, surreal,\n    that I'm allowed to see you naked.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You and every person in this country.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What is it about men and nudity?\n    Particularly breasts -- how can you be so\n    interested in them?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Well...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No seriously.  I mean, they're just\n    breasts.  Every second person in the\n    world has got them...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    More than that actually, when you think\n    about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very\n    nice pair...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    But... they're odd-looking.  They're\n    for milk.  Your mum's got them.

It is Anna with a tray of\n  toast and tea.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch.\n\n  She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Can I stay a bit longer?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Stay forever.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Damn, I forgot the jam.\n\n  The doorbell goes.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You get the door, I'll get the jam.\n\n<b>  INT./EXT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY\n</b>\n  William heads down the corridor and opens the door.  Outside\n  are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and\n  questions, of noise and light.  The press seem to fill the\n  entire street.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Jesus Christ.\n\n  He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.  Anna is in\n  the kitchen.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    What?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Don't ask.\n\n  She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You're up to something...\n\n  She thinks he's fooling around.

Your furry friend thought he'd\n    make a buck or two telling the papers\n    where I was.\n\n  She's packing.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    That's not true.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Really?  The entire British press just\n    woke up this morning and thought 'Hey --\n    I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in\n    that house with the blue door in Notting\n    Hill.'  And then you go out in your\n    goddamn underwear.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>      (dropping in)\n    I went out in my goddamn underwear too.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Get out, Spike.\n      (he does)\n    I'm so sorry.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    This is such a mess.

Can't we just\n    laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the\n    huge sweep of things, this stuff\n    doesn't matter.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    What he's going to say next is -- there\n    are people starving in the Sudan.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Well, there are.

My best\n    friend slipped -- she slipped down-\n    stairs, cracked her back and she's in a\n    wheelchair for the rest of her life.\n    All I'm asking for is a normal amount\n    of perspective.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You're right: of course, you're right.\n    It's just that I've dealt with this\n    garbage for ten years now -- you've had\n    it for ten minutes.

Outside are her people, including\n  Karen, a chauffeur, two bodyguards.  And then the door is shut\n  and they're all gone.  Silence.\n\n<b>  INT.

Followed by winter coats --\n  chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint\n  of snow.\n\n  Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,\n  for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.\n\n  By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and\n  in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --\n  arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns\n  past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.\n  The camera holds on her.\n\n<b>  INT.

Groovy.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Any more announcements?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- I feel I must apologize to\n    everyone for my behavior for the last\n    six months.  I have, as you know, been\n    slightly down in the mouth.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    There's an understatement.  There are\n    dead people on better form.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    But I wish to make it clear I've turned\n    a corner and henceforward intend to be\n    impressively happy.\n\n<b>  INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n</b>\n  Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a\n  chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon'\n  on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing.\n\n  At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table.\n\n<b>        BELLA\n</b>    I'm really horribly drunk.\n\n  Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    So -- you've laid the ghost.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I believe I have.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Don't give a damn about the famous girl.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, don't think I do.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    Which means you won't be distracted by\n    the fact that she's back in London,\n    grasping her Oscar, and to be found\n    filming most days on Hampstead Heath.\n\n  He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of\n  Anna on its cover.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>      (immediate gloom)\n    Oh God no.\n\n<b>        MAX\n</b>    So not over her, in fact.\n\n<b>  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY\n</b>\n  Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely\n  alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and\n  sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the\n  radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.\n\n<b>  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n  Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where\n  he is himself approached.\n\n<b>        SECURITY\n</b>    Can I help you?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...\n\n<b>        SECURITY\n</b>    Does she know you're coming?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    No, no.  She doesn't.\n\n<b>        SECURITY\n</b>    I'm afraid I can't really let you\n    through then, sir.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm\n    not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...\n\n<b>        SECURITY\n</b>    ... can't let you through.\n\n  At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door\n  open.  Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a\n  velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.\n  She has a necessary cluster of people about her.  Hair, make-up,\n  costume and the third assistant who has collected her.\n\n  She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And\n  sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a\n  simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.\n  Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole\n  paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The\n  movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and\n  followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When\n  she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her\n  people hold back.  She doesn't really know what to say...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    This is certainly... ah...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I only found out you were here\n    yesterday.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I was going to ring... but... I didn't\n    think you'd want to...\n\n  The third assistant is under pressure.\n\n<b>        THIRD\n</b>    Anna.\n\n  She looks around.  The poor third is nervous -- and the first is\n  approaching.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>      (to William)\n    It's not going very well -- and it's\n    our last day.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    But... wait... there are things to say.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Okay.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.\n\n  She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    Come and have a look...\n\n<b>  EXT. KENWOOD PARK - DAY\n</b>\n  As they make towards the set...\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    Are you a fan of Henry James?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    This is Henry James film?\n\n<b>  EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n  A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --\n  and a huge moving crane.  They end up next to the sound desk.\n\n<b>        KAREN\n</b>    This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of\n    headphones so you can hear the dialogue.\n\n  Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding\n  fellow.  He hands him the headphones.\n\n<b>        HARRY\n</b>    Here we go.  The volume control is on\n    the side.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    That's great.\n\n  William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is\n  a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping\n  wide-shot.  He watches Anna.  She is with her co-star in the\n  Henry James film -- let's call him James.\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    We are living in cloudcuckooland --\n    we'll never get this done today.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    We have to.  I've got to be in New York\n    on Thursday.\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    Oh, stop showing off.\n\n  He studies an actress a few yards to the left.\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    God, that's an enormous arse.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I'm not listening.\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so\n    many tragic young teenagers with\n    anorexia -- and that girl has an arse\n    she could perfectly well share round\n    with at least ten other women -- and\n    still be beg-bottomed.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I said I'm not listening -- and I think,\n    looking at something that firm, you and\n    your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'\n    would be well-advised to keep quiet.\n\n  Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his\n  girl.  Anna prepares.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    So I ask you when you're going to tell\n    everyone, and you say...?\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    And then I... right.\n\n<b>        JAMES\n</b>    Who was that rather difficult chap you\n    were talking to on the way up?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Oh... no one... no one.  Just some...\n    guy from the past.  I don't know what\n    he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward\n    situation.\n\n<b>  EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY\n</b>\n  Cut back to William -- he has heard.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Of course.\n\n  He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Thank you.\n\n<b>        HARRY\n</b>    Anytime.\n\n  William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't\n  have had a clear reminder.\n\n<b>  INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING\n</b>\n  William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    What's going on?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I'm going to throw out these old videos.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    No.  You can't bin these.  They're\n    classics.  I'm not allowing this.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Right -- let's talk about rent...\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    Let me help.  We don't want all this\n    shit cluttering up our lives.\n\n<b>  INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY\n</b>\n  The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a\n  dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    I have to disturb you when you're\n    cooking the books, but there's a\n    delivery.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Martin, can't you just deal with this\n    yourself?\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet\n    rag as much as I pay you?\n\n  They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing\n  his hands -- he's in a very good mood.\n\n<b>  INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY\n</b>\n  William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue\n  skirt and top.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Hi.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Hello.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You disappeared.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave...

But thank you anyway.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I actually had it in my apartment in New\n    York and just thought you'd... but,\n    when it came to it, I didn't know how to\n    call you... having behaved so... badly,\n    twice.  So it's been just sitting in the\n    hotel.  But then... you came, so I\n    figured... the thing is... the thing is\n<b>    ...\n</b>\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    What's the thing?\n\n  Then the door pings.  In walks the annoying customer, Mr. Smith.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Don't even think about it.  Go away\n    immediately.\n\n  Mr. Smith is taken aback and therefore completely obedient.\n\n<b>        MR. SMITH\n</b>    Right.  Sorry.\n\n  And he leaves.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    You were saying...\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away\n    today but I wondered, if I didn't,\n    whether you might let me see you a bit...\n    or, a lot maybe... see if you could...\n    like me again.\n\n  Pause as William takes this in.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    But yesterday... that actor asked you\n    who I was... and you just dismissed me\n    out of hand... I heard -- you had a\n    microphone... I had headphones.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    You expect me to tell the truth about my\n    life to the most indiscreet man in\n    England?\n\n  Martin edges up.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Excuse me -- it's your mother on the\n    phone.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Can you tell her I'll ring her back.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    I actually tried that tack -- but she\n    said you said that before and it's been\n    twenty-four hours, and her foot that\n    was purple is now a sort of blackish\n    color...\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold\n    the fort for a second will you, Martin?\n\n  Martin is left with Anna.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a\n    wonderful film.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Is that right?\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Yes... I've always wondered what\n    Patrick Swayze is like in real life.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I can't say I know Patrick all that\n    well.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the\n    filming?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly --\n    to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in\n    'Ghost.'\n\n  She's kind in here, not sarcastic.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Oh right.  Right.  Sorry.  Always been\n    a bit of an ass.\n\n  William returns a little uneasy.\n\n<b>        MARTIN\n</b>    Anyway... it's lovely to meet you.  I'm\n    a great fan of yours.  And Demi's, of\n    course.\n\n  Martin leaves them.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Sorry about that.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    That's fine.  There's always a pause\n    when the jury goes out to consider its\n    verdict.\n\n  She's awaiting an answer.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Anna.  Look -- I'm a fairly level-\n    headed bloke.  Not often in and out of\n    love.  But...\n\n  He can't really express what he feels.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    ... can I just say 'no' to your kind\n    request and leave it at that?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    ... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I...\n    you know... of course... I'll just...\n    be getting along then... nice to see\n    you.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    The truth is...\n\n  He feels he must explain.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    ... with you, I'm in real danger.  It\n    took like a perfect situation, apart\n    from that foul temper of yours -- but my\n    relatively inexperienced heart would,\n    I fear, not recover if I was once again\n    ... cast aside, which I would\n    absolutely expect to be.  There are too\n    many pictures of you everywhere, too\n    many films.  You'd go and I'd be...\n    well, buggered, basically.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I see.\n      (pause)\n    That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    I live in Notting Hill.  You live in\n    Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world\n    knows who you are.  My mother has\n    trouble remembering my name.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.\n\n  Pause.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    The fame thing isn't really real, you\n    know.  Don't forget -- I'm also just a\n    girl.

At last finds the room, and enters.\n\n<b>  INT. LANCASTER ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n  Huge room -- full of press.  Row after row of journalists,\n  cameras at the front, TV cameras at the back.  Anna clearly\n  gives press conferences very rarely, because this one is\n  positively presidential.  She sits at a table at the end of the\n  room, beside Karen: on her other side is Jeremy, the PR boss,\n  firmly marshalling the questions.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Yes... You -- Dominic.\n\n<b>        QUESTIONER 1\n</b>    How much longer are you staying in the\n    UK then?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No time at all.  I fly out tonight.\n\n  She's in a slightly melancholic and therefore honest mood.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Which is why we have to round it up now.\n    Final questions.\n\n  He points at a journalist he knows.\n\n<b>        QUESTIONER  2\n</b>    Is your decision to take a year off\n    anything to do with the rumours about\n    Jeff and his present leading lady?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Absolutely not.\n\n<b>        QUESTIONER 2\n</b>    Do you believe the rumours?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    It's really not my business any more.\n    Though I will say, from my experience,\n    that rumours about Jeff... do tend to\n    be true.\n\n  They love that answer, and all scribble in their note books.\n  Next question comes from someone straight right next to\n  William.\n\n<b>        QUESTIONER 3\n</b>    Last time you were here, there were some\n    fairly graphic photographs of you and a\n    young English guy -- so what happened\n    there?\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    He was just a friend -- I think we're\n    still friends.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.\n\n  He is pointing straight at William, who has his hand up.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes -- Miss Scott -- are there any\n    circumstances in which you two might be\n    more than just friends?\n\n  Anna sees who it is asking.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm\n    assured there aren't.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    And what would you say...\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    No, it's just one question per person.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    No, let him... ask away.  You were\n    saying?\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Yes, I just wondered whether if it\n    turned out that this... person...\n\n<b>        OTHER JOURNALIST\n</b>      (to William)\n    His name is Thacker.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    Thanks.  I just wondered if Mr. Thacker\n    realized he'd been a daft prick and got\n    down on his knees and begged you to\n    reconsider, whether you would...\n    reconsider.\n\n  We cut to Max, Bella, Bernie and Honey, all watching.  Then back\n  to Anna.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.\n\n<b>        WILLIAM\n</b>    That's very good news.  The readers of\n    'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely\n    delighted.\n\n  Anna whispers something to Jeremy.\n\n<b>        JEREMY\n</b>    Dominic -- if you'd like to ask your\n    question again?\n\n<b>        QUESTIONER 1\n</b>    Yes -- Anna -- how long are you\n    intending to stay here in Britain?\n\n  Pause.  Anna looks up at William.  He nods.\n\n<b>        ANNA\n</b>    Indefinitely.\n\n  They both smile -- suddenly the press gets what's going on --\n  music -- noise -- they all turn and flash, flash, flash photos\n  of William.  Max and Bella kiss.  Bernie kisses a total stranger.\n  Spike finally makes it -- he's bright red from running.\n\n<b>        SPIKE\n</b>    What happened?\n\n<b>        HONEY\n</b>    It was good.\n\n  Honey hugs him.  It's a new experience for Spike.\n\n  Cut to William's face -- flash after flash -- still looking at\n  Anna.  They are both smiling.\n\n<b>  INT./EXT. THE HEMPEL ZEN GARDEN WITH MARQUEEN - DAY\n</b>\n  Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the\n  crowd.\n\n  Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at\n  least four other bridesmaids, all under five.\n\n  Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,\n  pyramidical wedding cake.\n\n  William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She\n  tries to brush his hair.\n\n  Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is\n  dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little\n  move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.\n\n  Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a\n  song, entirely happy in the corner.\n\n<b>  EXT. LEICESTER SQUARE - NIGHT\n</b>\n  A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out\n  of the car, she holding his hand --  looking ultimately gorgeous\n  -- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.  He's startled.\n\n<b>  EXT. GARDEN - DAY\n</b>\n  A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched\n  by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very\n  old couple wander along slowly.\n\n  A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera\n  glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden\n  bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just\n  looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It\n  is William and Anna.\n\n<b>        THE END\n</b>\n<b>  --------------------------------------------------------------\n</b></pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Notting Hill</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Richard Curtis\" title=\"Scripts by Richard Curtis\">Richard Curtis</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Notting Hill Script.html#comments\" title=\"Notting Hill comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:12:42.155089"}
