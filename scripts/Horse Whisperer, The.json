We see a snow-covered field and distant woods. \n\tGrace presses her faces against the cold, frosted window \n\teager to get out.\n\n<b>\tINT.

She carries them into \n\tthe kitchen and sets them beside a huge stack of publications, \n\tmagazines, papers, etc... Knowing she must read all of them at \n\tsome point, she breathes a disgusted sign. She thumbs through \n\tthe POST as she pours herself a cup of coffee.

Spread out on the landscape are horses, on a horse \n\tfarm, standing like statues in the white covered fields.\n\n\tAs Grace comes along the hill, we see another GIRL (JUDITH) \n\tcoming from the opposite direction. She doesn't have Grace's \n\tlean elegance but her warm, friendly smile brightens her \n\tface. Upon reaching her, Grace returns the smile with a hug.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tIt's warmer than I thought.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tYou want to go to a movie tonight?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tI thought your mom's coming up?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\t\t(prickly)\n\t\tSo?\n\n\tJudith immediately senses a problem so she continues casually, \n\tas they begin walking away from Camera...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tMy parents are having friends from \n\t\tcollege over.

STABLES, THE DYER HORSE FARM - MORNING\n</b>\n\tThere are several horses in their stalls. Grace and Judith \n\tenter, talking, carrying their English saddles. Judith stops \n\tat a stall, disappearing into it as she says \"Hello?\"..., \n\tGrace continues to the end stall.\n\n\tPilgrim (the horse from the dream) stands looking at her.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tHello, beautiful boy.\n\n\tHe's a massive figure beside her but she shows no inhibition. \n\tShe enters, touching his muzzle.

ANNIE'S MAGAZINE OFFICE - MID-MORNING\n</b>\n\tAnnie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her \n\tmagazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of \n\tstalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we \n\tsee indications of the kind of magazine she edits.\n\n\tShe strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by \n\twindows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of \n\twhich are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE.\n\n\t(One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR \n\twith his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately \n\taround his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing \n\tlike a member of the royal family.)\n\n\tAnnie sits and takes a breath. The only photo on her desk is \n\ta family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal \n\tAward -- Robert, Grace, herself and the Award. She checks her \n\twatch -- it is almost 9:30.\n\n<b>\tINT. MACLEAN FARMHOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM/CLOSET - MID-MORNING\n</b>\n\tA WALK-IN CLOSET of the master bedroom; one side is Annie's, \n\tone side is Robert's.\n\n\tRobert stands before his bureau in the closet -- he has just \n\tshowered and is putting on his watch and ring which lay \n\tbeside his cologne assortment. A FRAMED PHOTO OF HE AND ANNIE \n\tin India -- younger, vibrant, in love... when they first met.\n\n\tTHE PHONE RINGS. Robert enters into the bedroom to pick up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ROBERT\n</b>\t\tHello?\n\n\tINSERT ANNIE: They speak in dulled, emotionless voices:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tIt's me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ROBERT\n</b>\t\tHi.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tHi.\n\n\tAwkward pause.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ROBERT\n</b>\t\tSo, what, uh, what train are you taking?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tI should be in by two.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ROBERT\n</b>\t\tOkay.

We'll see you later then.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tYeah. Bye.\n\n\tAnnie picks up the other line and her manner brightens, her \n\tenergy boosts...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tDON! My love, how are you? Did you hear \n\t\tabout Fiske?... No, suing is too \n\t\tcivilized. Can't we get your friend at Le \n\t\tCirque to serve him a fatal piece of \n\t\tpoached salmon?... Ha, ha... That's even \n\t\tbetter...\n\n<b>\tEXT. CONNECTICUT COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING\n</b>\n\tLong Shot of the girls riding at an easy pacing, talking all \n\tthe time. Grace is an elegant rider, quite self-assured for a \n\t13-year-old... We come into the scene at the moment the \n\tgirls have just shared a secret or a fantasy. Judith is \n\tgiggling uncontrollably. Grace laughs as she says:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\t...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tI just could never say it!\n\n\tThey stop at the end of the field, facing the woods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tDo you want to go around by the \n\t\told road?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tWhy don't we just cut through the \n\t\twoods?\n\n\tGrace nods. They ride into the woods, continuing their talk.\n\n<b>\tEXT. WOODS - MORNING\n</b>\n\tThe girls ride down, along a stand of hickories and poplars \n\tto a RIVER. They stop the horses and their conversation, to \n\tlisten to the sound of the water. Below them, off in the \n\tdistance, they can just make out a two-lane country road.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tYou want to go down or stay along \n\t\tthe river?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tWe already did the river.

ANNIE'S OFFICE - MORNING\n</b>\n\tAnnie's office is now crowded with a dozen or so employees; \n\tsitting on the couch, on the window sills, on the arms of \n\tchairs, against the walls... Paper bag emptied of bagels, \n\tcream cheese, orange juice, paper plates...\n\n\tHand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it \n\tfollows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how \n\tcasual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of \n\tcontrol... We enter the scene of LAUGHTER, as Annie asks \n\tKEVIN, a feature writer:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\t... So what did you say to her?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  KEVIN\n</b>\t\tI said, thank you very much...\n<b>\t\t\t(LAUGHTER, AD LIBS)\n</b>\t\tI really should do the interview...

I'm thinking about another fashion \n\t\tdesigner spread... Who's news out there?\n\n\tCharacters shout out designer names and comments as the phone \n\trings and LUCY picks up... speaking amdist the talking...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  LUCY\n</b>\t\tHold on.\n\t\t\t(presses hold)\n\t\tGottschalk.\n\n\tThe room goes dead quiet, instantly. Then erupts in laughter \n\tas everyone realizes it. Annie, however, waves her hand as \n\tshe takes the phone...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tQuiet... Quiet!\n\n\tEveryone obeys. Annie presses SPEAKER PHONE.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tDavid?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)\n</b>\t\tWho's there?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tEveryone. Working overtime.

Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone \n\twaits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is \n\tinteresting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the \n\tmagazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety -- \n\teven though she might have some. Finally:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DAVID GOTTSCHALK (VO)\n</b>\t\tWell, I suppose we could use another \n\t\tgood public feud...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tExactly...\n\n\tEveryone silently acknowledges Annie guts and influence.\n\n<b>\tEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING\n</b>\n\tIt's perfectly still. We are looking down an empty TWO-LANE \n\tROAD covered with fresh snow. We see the girls slowly riding \n\tout of the woods, talking. They cross the road and start up \n\tinto the woods on the other side... They are trying to sing a \n\tLIZ PHAIR song, \"CHOPSTICKS\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE/JUDITH\n</b>\t\t\t(singing)\n\t\t\"I met him at a party and he told me how \n\t\the like to drive me home...

Judith \n\tnotices first...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tWhat was --\n\n\tThe horse staggers... Judith looks to Grace --\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\tGrace!\n\n\tThe horse tries to find tracing with his hindfeet, kicking \n\tup sprays of snow and ice shards. The horse suddenly falls on \n\tthe ice and goes down hard on its knees...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b><b>\t\tJUDITH!\n</b>\n\tThe horse stumbles to get back on its feet, slipping again. \n\tFrightened, it rears and Judith, caught off balance, is \n\tthrown, her foot catching in the stirrup...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b><b>\t\tGRAAACE!\n</b>\n\tHer horse, unable to find its balance, starts to slide backward \n\tdown the incline.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b><b>\t\tPILGRIM, COME ON! MOVE!\n</b>\n\tGrace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid \n\tbeing hit by the errant horse.\n\n\tWhat follows, we see from Grace's perspective. The details \n\tthat form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast, \n\tdisembodies, almost surreal as --\n\n\tJudith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out \n\tfrom under him, sending both horses careening down the icy \n\tslope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg \n\thelplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head \n\tbouncing on the frozen ground.\n\n\tThey slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim \n\tis the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit \n\tup in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto \n\tits feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in \n\tconfused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her \n\tleg hanging from the stirrup.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\t\t(frightened)\n\t\tJude, you okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JUDITH\n</b>\t\t\t(softly, crying)\n\t\tI'm okay... I'm okay.\n\n\tShe tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup.\n\n\tGrace sees it before she hears it. A GLINT off of steel. We \n\tthen hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the \n\tbend... The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road... \n\tThe Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes \n\taround the turn... Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get \n\tJudith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays \n\ton the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle \n\tslipping out of Grace's hand...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b><b>\t\tJUUDE!!!\n</b>\n\t... The horses turn apart. The Driver starts furiously \n\tdownshifting, trying to brake... He seems to get it under \n\tcontrol when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice. It begins \n\tto slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack-\n\tknifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith \n\tand her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith \n\tdisappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic \n\tmonster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks \n\tright into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly, \n\tPilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing \n\ther off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck.\n\n\tPilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his \n\thooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some \n\tgrotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window, \n\tshattering through the glass.\n\n\tAnd then it is still.\n\n\tThe truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse \n\tlies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood, \n\this legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He \n\tshrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free \n\this legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, \n\twounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods...\n\n\tThe Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in \n\tshock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the \n\triver and the wind in the trees.\n\n\tGrace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the \n\tbeautiful morning sky.\n\n<b>\tWE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER...\n</b>\n<b>\tINT.

LIZ HAMMOND, \n\tthe local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her \n\tjacket, quietly walking into the water.\n\n\tA Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim, \n\twhose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water.

Frightened, \n\tPilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo \n\tin his neck. He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of \n\tthe river, the hypo still in his neck. He runs for the \n\tsanctuary of the woods.\n\n<b>\tINT. TRAIN - LATE MORNING\n</b>\n\tAnnie sits on a train -- her laptop out, notes beside her, \n\ther cellular phone, ever-ready.

She looks out the \n\twindow for the first time and sees:\n\n\tA MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She \n\twatches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young \n\tchildren, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as \n\this wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm \n\taround his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the \n\tfather listens to every word.\n\n\tAnnie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the \n\tplatform, she turns back to her laptop.

Something about his movements, his \n\tposture -- a sense of weakness, of surrendering, of not having \n\tthe inclination to fight, of just accepting and smoothing \n\tover the rough sports -- strikes her hard.

With the build of a \n\tfootball player, his strength never overwhelms his boyish, \n\tgood-natured heart. Joe is eleven, wearing his cowboy hat \n\tlike a badge of honor. The three men seem as inseparable to \n\teach other, as they are to the land.

He hears Annie on the phone and \n\tlooks to the other room, the door ajar -- seeing only her \n\tlegs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. Her foot \n\ttaps impatiently.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tFirst time in Montana?\n\n\tGrace, rudely nods, still looking at the TV.\n\n\tBeat.

Annie gives Grace a final look and exits, closing the door.\n\n\tAlone, Grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her \n\tprosthetic -- putting it on feverishly. She is completely \n\tintrigued by Tom.\n\n<b>\tEXT. PETERSON'S STABLES - DAY\n</b>\n\tTom stands alone at the stable.

Okay now...\n\n\tWalking towards him, Tom raises his hand, showing Pilgrim a \n\tsign of respect, of trust... He quietly makes his way along \n\tPilgrim's side, along his flank, prompting Pilgrim to move \n\tout from the shadows, into the light. Tom moves to look at \n\thim. And Pilgrim suddenly kicks out at him. Tom, not cowed, \n\tstands his ground. He bends, looking at Pilgrim's withered \n\tlegs. He looks up at his scarred head. He looks into the \n\tpools of the horse's tortured eyes. Pilgrim stands still -- \n\tallowing Tom this brief intimacy.\n\n\tAs Grace walks towards the stable, she realizes that the door \n\tis open and Tom must be inside. She is amazed.\n\n\tAnnie, appearing behind her, is also impressed.\n\n\tTom exits the stable and sees them, as he closes the doors.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tWell...

He \n\tstops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes -- \n\tin a way that reminds us of how Tom looked at Pilgrim.\n\n\tExcept, Grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. \n\tShe turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post -- \n\tas if she doesn't care. Tom turns to Annie.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tI have to be honest. I still feel \n\t\tyou made a long trip for nothing.\n\n\tHe looks at Annie. Annie has no more words -- just an ever-\n\tpresent pleading in her face.\n\n\tTom watches as Grace makes a small, naked movement -- putting \n\ther hand on her cheek, like a hurt child.\n\n\tHe can't help but see these three being connected by one wound.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tBut before I even think about it, I \n\t\tneed to know something here and now. \n\t\tIt's a question for Grace here.\n\n\tGrace stiffens.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tWhen I work with a horse, it's no good \n\t\tjust me doing it.

But she's the one \n\t\twho's gonna be riding him, am I right? \n\t\tSo here's the deal.

And I \n\t\tdon't want to waste anybody's time -- \n\t\tmostly mine.\n\n\tGrace reacts anew to Tom's remark. She likes her mother being \n\tdis-empowered. Annie keenly understands the importance of Tom \n\tputting it this way to Grace. Grace has all eyes on her -- \n\tjust what she wants. All waiting for her response. She turns \n\taway, flicks her head and says:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWell, there's nothing else to do around \n\t\there.\n\n\tAnnie smiles in relief. But Tom isn't satisfied.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tNot good enough. I can't help you.\n\n\tHe starts walking away. Annie doesn't know what to do.

Some stray cows \n\trun out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse \n\tshepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside.\n\n\tAt the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly \n\tbefore him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom \n\twhistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup \n\ttruck is parked on the range.\n\n\tJoe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back \n\tof the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food. \n\tWhat begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then \n\thundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them.\n\n\tTom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in \n\tthe distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road \n\tto the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out \n\tof the car with Grace.

Even though there is such a distance, \n\tthere's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other.\n\n\tTom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the \n\trange -- the Twins in the back, the cattle following.

Tom, crouched by \n\tthe pond, silently concentrating on Pilgrim...\n\n\tGrace watches, off by herself... Annie stands beside Joe. She \n\tcan't help but be intrigued by the sight. She asks Joe;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tI though horses were afraid of \n\t\twater?\n\n\tJoe doesn't answer her. Grace likes that.

She hides her embarrassment by answering \n\tit, walking away. Tom gives her a look. Grace is loving this. \n\tTom turns back to Pilgrim. After a few moments --\n\n\tTom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He \n\tstarts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful, \n\tfights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out \n\tof the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he \n\tis concerned too, though he stands quietly.\n\n\tAnnie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes \n\ther call to return to the pond.\n\n\tTom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab \n\tPilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and \n\tSmokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie \n\tappears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope \n\tagain. Pilgrim rears again.

Annie, needing to know exactly what's going \n\ton, crosses down the hill to him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tSo what now? Should we leave?\n\n\tTom continues watching Pilgrim. Annie looks at him, sitting \n\tthere motionless and feels like an idiot.

Annie, awkwardly, \n\twalks back up the hill to where Grace is...\n\n\tON THE GRASSY HILLSIDE, Grace is watching the scene by herself \n\tas Joe appears, staring at her leg... It makes her uncomfortable. \n\tShe turns to him with a curt, impatient tone;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWhat?\n\n\tTheir eyes meet.

Tom is riding among them, holding a long stick \n\twith an orange flag at the end of it, waving it at the young \n\thorses, making them run away from him. The colts stay close \n\ttogether. One of the horses, PILGRIM, stays at a distance, off \n\tto himself.\n\n\tGrace watches from along the railing. She alternates her \n\tattention from the horses... to Tom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\t What we're doing here, Grace, is \n\t\t trying to get him to learn how to \n\t\t be a horse again.\n\n\tHe cracks the flag, the horses move together...\n\n<b>\t\t  \t \t  TOM\n</b>\t\tThe others already know, see. That's \n\t\thow they are in the wild -- herd \n\t\tanimals...\n\t\t\t(cracks the flag)\n\t\t...When they've got a problem, like \n\t\tthey have now with me and this flag, \n\t\tthey look to each other. But old \n\t\tPilgrim there has forgotten. I'm the \n\t\trock and they're the hard place. He \n\t\tthinks he hasn't got a friend in the \n\t\twhole wild world...\n\n\tC.U. on GRACE, who clearly feels the same way... but wants \n\tdesperately not to. She watches him ride off towards Pilgrim \n\twho has stopped like all the others at the far end of the \n\tring. He stands by himself, tossing his head, snorting, not \n\twanting to be around other horses. Tom cracks the flag, \n\tkeeping them moving. Pilgrim does his own private dance.\n\n\tTom rides by Grace and hands her the stick;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHold this for a minute...\n\n\tGrace stiffens. She doesn't want to, but she's afraid to say \n\t\"No\" to Tom. He just insists by tossing it to her...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHold onto it, go on...\n\n\tShe's forced to catch it. He turns and rides away, chasing \n\tdown Pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd. For a \n\tmoment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses. But \n\tas soon as he's clear of Tom, he separates himself and comes \n\tto stop on his own.\n\n\tTom rides back to Grace, taking back the flag.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tWe'll get there, Grace.\n\n\tAs he says this, he flashes a small, reassuring smile and a \n\tlittle wink. Grace melts just a little. As he rides away.\n\n\tAnnie appears, having come from the Creek House. She calls:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tGrace? The clinic just called... \n\t\tThey had to change your physical \n\t\ttherapy appointment. We have to \n\t\tleave now.\n\n\tGrace frowns a little -- her mother's \"perfect timing.\" Annie \n\tapproaches the arena, watching Tom riding. As he passes her;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHello, Annie...\n\n\tAnnie notices how he says her name.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tMr. Booker...\n\n\tHe flashes a smile in her direction and Annie's expression \n\tcomically matches her daughter's reaction. She quickly covers \n\tit, however. Her eyes follow him as he glides around the \n\tarena. It's like watching a great ballet -- his control of the \n\thorses, his effortlessness, his grace, his strength... She \n\tsmiles to herself in appreciation. Then catches herself:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(to Grace)\n\t\tYou got everything you need?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tIf I had everything I need, I wouldn't \n\t\tbe going to physical therapy.\n\n\tTom approaches as he overhears Grace respond;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t  (trying to cheer her)\n\t\tHoney, come on. Would you like to stay \n\t\tin town for dinner? Maybe see what \n\t\tmovie's playing tonight?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWhy? There's no food in the house?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tNo. I just thought... forget it.\n\n\tHe's getting a clearer view of their relationship.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tYou know, we're branding here \n\t\ttomorrow. If you two want to come \n\t\tby to watch or give a hand, you're \n\t\twelcome.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\tBranding?\n\t\t\t(sarcastic)\n\t\tI haven't branded in years.\n\n\tTom chuckles.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tI'll come.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tUh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... \n\t\tI think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's \n\t\tway.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tAs long as you don't get in the way of \n\t\tthe branding iron, it doesn't matter too \n\t\tmuch.\n\n\tAnnie smiles. She turns to Grace, questioningly. Grace says \n\tmatter-of-factly, to prove her point.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tI watched Margo Neuberger get a \n\t\ttattoo.\n\n\tTom squints. Annie shrugs and nods.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tOkay.\n\n\tAs Grace and Annie walk to the car, Tom says:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHey, Grace -- maybe we can get your \n\t\tmom to put me and you branding on the \n\t\tcover of her magazine. Start a whole \n\t\tnew fashion craze.\n\n\tThey continue walking as Grace smiles, enjoying being singled \n\tout for his joke. Annie responds, almost flirtatiously.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tTry not to fall off your high horse, \n\t\tMr. Booker.\n\n\tTom tips his hat and rides away... Annie smiles and nods... \n\tGrace doesn't like their sudden familiarity. Or her mother's \n\tcoy manner. As they enter the Suburban, Grace asks point blank;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tDid you call Dad today?\n\n\tAnnie is caught off guard.\n\n\tTom, riding in the arena, catches himself looking after them... \n\tthen goes riding after Pilgrim.\n\n<b>\tEXT. DOUBLE DIVIDE - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe air smells of scorched flesh. There is nothing but NOISE. \n\tCalves, separated from their mothers, \"cry.\" They are moved \n\tout through a series of connected pens into a narrow chute, \n\tand then one by one into a holding pen. They're clamped and \n\tlowered sideways onto a table and given a shot, a yellow \n\tinsect tag in one ear, branded, then sent back to their \n\tmother's. The bulls, in a pen by themselves, stand haughty, \n\tpaying no attention. Frank helps \"doctor\" the calves. Joe \n\tbrands.\n\n\tAnnie and Grace are standing by the railing, watching with a \n\tmixture of fascination and disgust.\n\n\tTom moves in the feeder pen, waist deep in calves, moving them \n\tthrough the chute. He looks to Annie.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHey, over there, you want to make \n\t\tyourself useful?\n\n\tIt isn't a question.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tHank, I got you a volunteer!\n\n\tAnnie and Grace realize they have no choice.\n\n<b>\t-- WHAT FOLLOWS IS A SEQUENCE OF SCENES SHOWING ANNIE AND \n</b><b>\tGRACE PARTICIPATING IN THE BRANDING.

Rubbing them, cleaning up \n\t\tthe stalls... You think you can \n\t\thandle that?\n\n\tGrace knows him well enough to know;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tThat's not a question, is it?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tYou're catching on.\n\n\tGrace smiles.\n\n\t-- Annie turns and, not looking where she's doing, trips over \n\ta calf, falling down. And calves, coming down the chute, \n\tstart to run towards her. Suddenly, Tom grabs her by the leg \n\tand pulls her to safety. He helps her up and dusts her off.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\t\t(not wanting to smile, \n\t\t\t but...)\n\t\tYou okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tIt is cocktail hour yet?\n\n\tTom laughs. She takes a big breath.\n\n<b>\tEXT. THE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n\tThe ranch is colored in amber light.\n\n\tNear the house, two long tables pushed together to make one \n\tlong one... A gentle breeze ruffles the tablecloth. Everyone \n\tis seated for a meal. We hear laughter and conversation... We \n\tparachute into the middle of the moments;\n\n\t-- Hank helping with his wife get to their three children to \n\tsit still for dinner...\n\n\t-- Diane organizing the women and their various plates of side \n\tdishes...\n\n\t-- The Ranch Hand piling up their plates and kidding each \n\tother...\n\n\t-- Joe is instructing Grace on the various sauces for the \n\tribs. The Twins are making fun of him behind his back.\n\n\t-- Tom and Smokey are barbecuing, the last one to sit.\n\n\t-- Frank assists his frail mother, ELLEN BOOKER, at the table, \n\tfilling her plate with all the things she can't reach for.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n\tThe faces are beautiful. Laughing. Eating. Everyone is tanned \n\tand exhausted after a long day, but filled with life and \n\teager to live it. The tables are covered with heavy food. \n\tThe communion at this table is as much a part of the ritual \n\tas the branding itself...\n\n\tAnnie and Grace look different to us. Tanned from the sun, \n\ttheir bodies sore -- they feel softened, yet more vital. As if \n\tthe artifice had been worn off... the armor of urban life. As \n\tthe table thrives with conversations, we focus on:\n\n\tAnnie and Ellen Booker. Annie looks calmer than we've seen \n\ther -- and more naturally beautiful. She is seated beside \n\tEllen Booker. We sense they have been talking for a while. \n\tAnnie is so sincerely interested in listening to her, she's \n\thardly touched her own plate...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ELLEN BOOKER\n</b>\t\t... he was a blacksmith by trade, my \n\t\tfather. My grandson Joe was named \n\t\tfor him. But he always dreamed of \n\t\thaving his own place and raising \n\t\thorses...\n\n\tWe see Tom a few places down and across from Annie and his \n\tmother -- but fully aware of their conversation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ELLEN BOOKER\n</b>\t\tHe'd heard of some land. What's \n\t\tStockett now. Rode out there. Got off \n\t\this horse and walked about as far as \n\t\the could in one way. Then he walked as \n\t\tfar as he could another way and \n\t\tanother until he got back to where he \n\t\tstarted and that's where he put his \n\t\troots down... That's where my husband \n\t\tand I ranched and raised Frank and \n\t\tTommy...\n\n\tShe motions proudly to Tom who looks up. Annie smiles to him. \n\tHe looks to her with gratitude for the respect she's showing \n\this mother.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ELLEN BOOKER\n</b>\t\tQuite a different life from what you \n\t\tknow, I expect. Which place to you \n\t\tcall home?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tWell, I was born in London, but my \n\t\tfather was an ambassador and we \n\t\tmoved constantly. I've lived in a lot \n\t\tof places but I don't really know what \n\t\tI'd call home.\n\n\tTom listens to this.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ELLEN BOOKER\n</b>\t\tAn ambassador! My! That's very \n\t\timportant.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tHe was a wonderful man.\n\n\tShe looks to Tom and he can sense a sadness around this in her \n\teyes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\t\t(to Grace)\n\t\tI sure hope you're gonna eat more \n\t\tthan that, young lady. You're a \n\t\tgrowing girl.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tI've never eaten this much in my \n\t\tlife.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tProbably never worked so hard, \n\t\tneither. Those arms of yours are \n\t\tgonna be pretty sore tomorrow. I'll \n\t\tgive you a little bit of ointment I \n\t\tmake. It's a magic recipe my Mama \n\t\tgave me.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tWe used to call Diane's mother \n\t\tMedicine Woman. None of us never went \n\t\tto the doctor when she was alive.\n\n\tAnnie and Grace listen in...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HANK\n</b>\t\tToo bad she wasn't here for old \n\t\tHenry Vanoker...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tNot much would have helped him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tI never got that whole story, what \n\t\thappened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HANK\n</b>\t\tOld Henry was changing a flat tire on \n\t\this truck over on 118 when that...\n\t\t\t(laughs)\n\t\t... two-hundred-year-old jack he has \n\t\tgives way and the side of that truck \n\t\tcome slamming down on that rock he \n\t\tcalls head...\n\n\tThere's laughter -- everyone knows Old Henry. Except:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tWhat happened?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HANK\n</b>\t\tKnocked him out for a while. He woke \n\t\tup, finished putting on the tire and \n\t\tdrove himself to the hospital.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tOld Fool... Darling, pass down those peas \n\t\tfor me, thank you.\n\n\tAnnie and Grace don't know how to respond... But everyone else \n\ttakes it their stride as they continue eating...\n\n\tGrace notices Joe is whispering something to Frank, who nods \n\this head and speaks to the table.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tHuh, Joe here has something to say.\n\n\tJoe stands, somewhat formally, with his hat on.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tI wrote this for you Grandma...\n\n\tMrs. Booker, and Diane, beam. Annie and Grace don't know what \n\tto expect. Joe stands straight as an arrow and recites a poem \n\tfrom memory...\n\n\tAt first, Annie and Grace appear to be embarrassed for the boy \n\tbut soon they can't help but be won over by his guilessness. \n\tHe finishes and everyone applauds. Hank's wife asks:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  HANK'S WIFE\n</b>\t\tThat was lovely. Who wrote that, \n\t\tJoe?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tI wrote it myself, ma'am.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tNow son, you tell 'em when it came \n\t\tfrom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tBe honest, I can't say I did it all \n\t\tmyself. My grandma helped me get the \n\t\twords right.\n\n\tOOoo's and aah's and smiles and conversations erupting over \n\teach other.\n\n\tOnly we see, Grace looking over to Joe who gives her kickass, \n\tshy grin...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\t\t(raising his beer)\n\t\tWell, I'd like to welcome Annie and \n\t\tGrace to their first branding...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tAnd next time, Miss Annie, you can run \n\t\tdown the calves...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tI'll drink to that...\n\n\tEveryone toasts and drinks. Annie and Tom exchange a look. \n\tShe smiles, but not in a alluring way -- rather, in a grateful \n\tway. Grateful for this brief moment of community and good \n\tfeeling. And somehow, Tom knows what she's feeling.\n\n\tNo one notices this silent exchange -- except for Diane, who \n\tsees everything that's going on.\n\n<b>\tINT. RANCH HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHTFALL\n</b>\n\tThe Women are bringing in dishes and plates and food from the \n\ttables through the house and into the kitchen. Annie is among \n\tthem, feeling apart of the group. She enters carrying a large \n\tbowl, that held the corn.\n\n\tDiane is replacing newly-cleaned forks and knives in her \n\tdining room drawers, above which are several FAMILY PICTURES.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\t\t(referring to clean bowl)\n\t\tWhere does this go, Diane?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tOh, you can just set up on the dining \n\t\ttable. I have to rearrange my shelves \n\t\ttomorrow.\n\n\tAnnie complies. She notices the framed pictures on the wall in \n\tthe dining room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tIs this Mr. Booker? Tom's \n\t\tgrandfather?\n\n\tDiane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tMm-mm. I never knew him. He died \n\t\tbefore Frank and I met. This here's...\n\t\t\t(another photo)\n\t\tFrank and Tom's mother and father... \n\t\tthere's little Frank and Tom...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tShe calls him Tommy...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tAlways did. I think she favored him a \n\t\tlittle. You tend to when you have more \n\t\tthan one, even though you love 'em all \n\t\tthe same.\n\n\tShe studies the old faces of Tom's Parents -- although 20th \n\tCentury people, there is still a pioneering strength in their \n\tvisage... a stoicism and power.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\t\t(putting away forks)\n\t\tHa, she loves telling this story about \n\t\thow when he was two years old, he ran off. \n\t\tThey found him in the barn, sleeping \n\t\tbetween two giant hooves of a Percheron \n\t\tstallion. She said that horse was \n\t\tprotecting him and nobody could convince \n\t\ther otherwise.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tI got a little confused though. The ranch \n\t\tEllen was talking about -- that's not this \n\t\tone?\n\n\tDiane is sorting silverware throughout the following:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  DIANE\n</b>\t\tNo. See, Frank and Tom were raised near \n\t\tthe Clark's Fork River, right between the \n\t\tPryor and Beartooth Mountains. Beautiful \n\t\tpiece of land. But they had this uncle \n\t\tNed -- useless man, never interested in \n\t\tranching. And when the grandparents died, \n\t\the left for the city and sent word \n\t\tthrough lawyers he wanted his claim to \n\t\tthe land so he could sell it. Three years \n\t\tof legation broke their father. Frank took \n\t\tit all in stride, but Tom... Tom loved that \n\t\tland. I don't think he ever got over it -- \n\t\tHis home being sold out from under him. \n\t\tSeeing his father like that. Once he and \n\t\tFrank got their folks set up in a new \n\t\tplace, Tom left... went off. We didn't see \n\t\thim for years...\n\n\tAnnie is intrigued by what she's learning about Tom. \n\tSomething outside the window catches her eyes. She watches:\n\n<b>\tPOV;\n</b><b>\t\n</b>\tTom and Frank, on either side to Ellen, are escorting her to \n\ta car that will drive her home.\n\n<b>\tEXT. RANCH HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tAnnie wanders out, passing Grace and Joe on her way out. The two \n\tare sitting in a glider. As Annie exits O.C., we hear them;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWhy do you always wear that hat?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tBecause it fits my head. You want to \n\t\ttry it on?\n\n\tGrace doesn't know if she should.\n\n\tAnnie continues towards Tom who's sitting in a rocker playing \n\twith the twins.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TWINS\n</b>\t\tShow us again!

Hold out your \n\t\tfinger.\n\n\tAnnie takes a seat nearby and watches as Tom holds out the \n\tfirst finger of his right hand. The Twins holds out his. Tom \n\tsplits his focus between Annie and the Twins as he takes a \n\tsmall piece of rope out of his back pocket. He ties the ends \n\ttogether making a loop. He puts the loop over the Twin's \n\tfinger. And holding the other end of the loop taut with his \n\tleft hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with \n\tthe middle finger of his right hand. Then he rolls his hand \n\tover so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that \n\this finger is tip to tip with the Twin's. The loop seemingly \n\tknotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be \n\tremoved if their touch is broken.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tThe loop's knotted, right.\n\t\t\t(Twins nod)\n\t\tLooks like the only way to take it \n\t\toff, is if we break our touch...\n\t\t\t(they nod)\n\t\tWatch now...\n\n\tAnnie and the Twins look down at the touching fingers as Tom \n\tgently pulls the rope away, revealing they are still knotted, \n\tand without even breaking their touch...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TWINS\n</b>\t\tAgain!

There \n\t\tare a few people back home I'd like \n\t\tto put under a red hot iron.\n\n\tTom looks at her with a sly expression, and notices she's \n\tshivering.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tYou got too much sun today... \n\t\tHere...\n\n\tHe takes his jacket and puts it around her shoulders.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tThank you.\n\n\tHe sits back down. Annie crosses her arms over her chest, \n\tlooks around, unconsciously swinging her foot. Tom watches \n\ther leg.

And \n\tthey can just see the old CREEK HOUSE hidden in the shade of \n\tsome trees along the creek...\n\n\tTom looks over at Annie, who is looking out over this \n\tbeautiful vista.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tIt's a whole other world you have \n\t\tgoing on here.

And everything \n\t\tthat seems like life or death some \n\t\tplace else -- doesn't affect any of \n\t\tthis one bit.\n\n\tTom is impressed by her feelings. He sees her saddle cinch \n\tneeds fixing and gets off his horse.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tLift your leg.\n\n\tAnnie complies once she realizes what he's doing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tHow long did you live here with your \n\t\twife?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tFive years.

But Annie understands.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tShe was the most beautiful thing I'd \n\t\tever seen.\n\n\tAnnie sees Tom as if with new eyes -- his love for this woman \n\the lost.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tWhy didn't it work out?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tShe was never really happy here.

And we after \n\t\ttried. We tried everything, but... \n\t\twasn't meant to be.\n\n\tThere is an awkward silent beat for a moment. Annie is \n\tmomentarily self-conscious. Tom helps by speaking of himself;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tI hear that! See, I knew she was never \n\t\tgoing to be a ranchest, but I wanted \n\t\tto try -- I thought maybe she'd give \n\t\tmusic lessons to the kids in town or at \n\t\tthe school, maybe even recitals. My son \n\t\twould grow up here. Maybe have one or \n\t\ttwo more. I'd teach 'em what I could. \n\t\tThey'd play with my brother's kids. All \n\t\tgrow up together. And even if they all \n\t\tdecided to go out into the world, they'd \n\t\talways know where home was -- cause we'd \n\t\tkeep it for 'em...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tThat's very important to you, isn't it? \n\t\tHome.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tYeah, I think it is.

She puts down her cane, \n\tthen puts her hand on the saddle horn. She puts her \n\tprosthetic leg into a stirrup. Frightened, she starts to \n\tshake;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tYou sure?\n\n\tAngry, determined, Grace tries to swing her leg onto the \n\thorse. She can't do it. Tears of frustration on her face.

Frightened, Joe runs to \n\ther.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  JOE\n</b>\t\tYou okay?\n\n\tShe gasps to catch her breath. He reaches to help her up. She \n\tpulls her hand away. Embarrassed, she \"runs\" off.

She stops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  ANNIE\n</b>\t\tYou look really pretty.\n\n\tGrace is a little self-conscious but grateful.

Joe is holding a \n\tsaddle and a bridle, standing in some shadows in an empty \n\tarena. Pilgrim comes running into the ring. Out of habit, he \n\tstarts circling the ring. He sees Tom holding a saddle. \n\tPilgrim walks towards him. Curious, he stops, looking at him. \n\tTom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it. Pilgrim \n\twalks towards him again. He stops, looking at Tom again. Tom \n\tjust sits there, playing with the bridle. Pilgrim walks \n\taround him. Tom doesn't show him any interest. Pilgrim comes \n\tcloser. He looks at the saddle. He runs off. He stops, \n\tlooking back. Tom just sits. Pilgrim walks back over. Tom \n\tstands and shows him the bridle. Pilgrim comes closer, \n\tsniffing it. He rubs his nose against the leather. Tom pats \n\this head. Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the \n\tbridle on him. Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem \n\tto bother him. Grace and Annie watch intently. Tom takes the \n\treins, walking Pilgrim around the ring. He walks him to the \n\tsaddle. Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof. He turns and runs \n\toff. Tom lets him go. Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows \n\tdown, looks over at Tom. Tom picks up the saddle. Pilgrim, \n\tcautiously, comes back over. Tom, with the saddle, walks away \n\tfrom him. Pilgrim, again curious, follows him. He nudges Tom. \n\tTom stops. Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the \n\tsaddle. Tom rubs his back. And gently, like laying down a \n\tsheet, puts the saddle on his back. Pilgrim shuffles slightly \n\tat the touch. Tom quickly cinches it. Taking up the reins, he \n\twalks Pilgrim around the ring again. He starts to jog. \n\tPilgrim jogs with him. And in the middle of the jog, Tom \n\tgrabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride, \n\tpulls himself back up onto his back. He lays across the \n\tsaddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight. He sits up, and \n\twithout letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with \n\this thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring.\n\n\tGrace and Annie cheer. Tom tips his hat to them...\n\n<b>\tINT. THE BARN - DAY\n</b>\n\tGrace is cleaning stalls, etc... She exits one of the stalls \n\twith a pail and stops -- looking down the barn to where she \n\tknows Pilgrim is. She places the pail down and gathers her \n\tcourage. She walks to Pilgrim's stall. She stands motionless \n\tfor some moments before she opens the doors and enters...\n\n\tPilgrim steps back a bit. He looks at her. He pins his ears \n\tback. Stomps his feet. Grace is about to turn and leave, but \n\tshe stops herself and remains still.\n\n\tSlowly, she reaches out to touch Pilgrim's head... and he \n\tlets her. We see in Grace a maturity of character, a \n\twillingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a \n\tcompassion, not only for Pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as \n\twell.\n\n<b>\tEXT.

Joe switches \n\tpartners, but Annie smiles and excuses herself -- she wants to \n\trest.\n\n\tRobert continues talking with some of the men. He puts out \n\this smoke and looks over to the dance floor. He sees Grace now \n\tdancing with Tom... His eyes search for Annie. He moves away \n\tfrom the men until he sees, from a distance;\n\n\tAnnie, sitting by herself, amidst the crowd... No one would \n\tnotice her unless they were looking for her... But Robert does \n\t-- and what he sees is Annie looking at Grace and Tom... then, \n\tonly looking at Tom... Smiling to herself gently... Watching \n\this every move.

THE RIDING ARENA - DAY\n</b>\n\tThere's a stillness. A sense of import. Annie, Robert, Frank, \n\tDiane, Joe and Smokey, are all at various spots along the fence.\n\n\tGrace stands inside the ring. Tom is standing beside Pilgrim \n\tin the middle of the ring. Pilgrim is bridled and saddled. \n\tTom adjusts he stirrup. He walks over to Grace...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tAll set?\n\n\tGrace swallows hard, nodding. She's worried...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tSure?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\t\t(softly)\n\t\tSure.\n\n\tTom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to \n\tPilgrim. The horse pricks up his ears as they approach. Tom \n\tmotions Grace to stop a short distance from Pilgrim so as not \n\tto crowd him. Tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take \n\thold of him. Holding him by the bridle, he puts his head \n\tbeside Pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing Pilgrim's \n\tneck with his other hand...\n\n\tAnnie and Robert are fascinated. Anxious.\n\n\tPilgrim never takes his eyes off Grace. Tom tries to ease him \n\tforward. Pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at \n\tGrace so you can see the white at the top of his eye. Tom \n\tturns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him. \n\tHe leads him back to Grace. Pilgrim tosses his head and \n\tstomps his feet.\n\n\tRobert grows more anxious. Annie is calmer, more focused.\n\n\tTom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy \n\tlope. Grace watches them go round the ring. She looks at her \n\tparents and tries to smile. They try as well.\n\n\tTom dismounts and leads Pilgrim back to Grace. Pilgrim balks \n\tagain, violently throwing his head, kicking... Grace's \n\tshoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, \n\tfighting not to cry...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tSmokey...\n\n\tSmokey climbs over the rail into the ring as Tom says something \n\tto him.

Tom'll get \n\t\thim, okay, you'll see...\n\n\tSmokey jogs over to the gate, climbing it, and disappearing \n\tinto the barn. Tom crosses to Grace.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tThere's still something going on \n\t\tinside of him I can't reach. So me \n\t\tand Smokey here, we're going to \n\t\ttry laying him down. Okay?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWhat does that mean?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tIt's more or less how it sounds. \n\t\tSometimes it's not pretty to watch. \n\t\tSome horses fight it real hard. \n\t\tYour fella's already shown us he \n\t\tlikes a good fight. So if you don't \n\t\twant to watch, I'll call you when it's \n\t\tdone.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tI want to watch.\n\n\tSmokey re-enters the ring, carrying some rope. He talks \n\tbriefly to Tom. Pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to \n\tthe far side of the ring. Tom, his arms spread, walks over \n\tto him, keeping him by the fence. Tom takes him by the \n\tbridle. Smokey comes beside him. Tom unhitches the bridle and \n\tin its place slips a rope halter Smokey passes to him. \n\tSmokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time. Tom \n\tfastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle \n\thorn. Tom asks Smokey.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tYou got that soft rope?\n\n\tSmokey hands it to him. Tom quietly talks to Pilgrim, runs \n\this hand down Pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof. \n\tPilgrim slightly shifts. And when he's still, Tom slips the \n\tloop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure \n\tit's snug. And taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the \n\tweight of Pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the \n\tsaddle horn. Pilgrim stands on three legs -- an explosion \n\twaiting to happen. Tom moves away from Pilgrim, taking the \n\thalter line from Smokey. Pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's \n\tcrippled. Scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg. \n\tSeeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run. Tom and \n\tSmokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force \n\thim around them in a tight circle. He goes around and around \n\tlike a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg. Tom looks over \n\tand sees Annie has left Robert outside the ring to stand by \n\tan anguished Grace -- her hands on her shoulders, gripping \n\ther. Robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tWhat is he doing this?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\tIt'll be OK, Grace.\n\n\tBut even Frank isn't so sure. Pilgrim, covered in sweat, \n\tstill circles. As he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, \n\ttrying to find peace. He runs and runs as Tom and Smokey lean \n\ton the ropes -- until he can't run any more and stops. Tom and \n\tSmokey let the lines go slack. Pilgrim, stands there, his wet \n\tsides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping \n\tsounds. Tom and Smokey speak. Smokey hands him his rope. \n\tTurning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand. He swings \n\tthe rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over Pilgrim's \n\tsaddle horn. He pulls it tight. And he takes the other end of \n\tthe rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick \n\trelease knot to the bottom rung. Coming back he takes the \n\tother two lines from Tom. Tom crosses to the rail. He starts \n\tputting pressure on the rope. Pilgrim feeing it, braces \n\thimself. The pressure tilts the saddle hold downward.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  FRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(to Grace and Annie)\n\t\tHe's trying to get him to go down \n\t\ton his knees...\n\n\tPilgrim fights. Tom pulls on the rope. Pilgrim, slowly, \n\tbegrudgingly, gives ground. Tom, brings him to his knees, \n\tbut it is short lived. Pilgrim is muscling his way back to \n\this feet. Tom pulls him down to his knees again. Pilgrim, \n\tfighting with every bit of strength, slowly gets to his feet \n\tagain. But the pressure Tom is putting on the saddle is too \n\tstrong and relentless and finally Pilgrim goes down on his \n\tknees and stays down. Yet Tom keeps the pressure on... Tom \n\tshouts to Smokey.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tDrop the lines and come help me...\n\n\tSmokey, dropping the line, runs over. They both pull on \n\tthe saddle rope.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  GRACE\n</b>\t\tThat's enough! Stop it!\n\n\tPilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth, fighting. But \n\tslowly, like a wounded bird, she starts giving in. He \n\trolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and \n\tis still. It seems like a total, humiliating surrender. \n\tGrace starts to sob, burying her face in Annie's chest. \n\tRobert feels impotent to help.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b><b>\t\tGRACE!\n</b>\n\tTom and Smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big \n\tgame hunters at the carcass of a kill.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tGRACE!

Tom speaks gently;\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tI want you to lay down with him. I \n\t\twant you to stroke him.

She takes a breath and slowly \n\tkneels in the dirt beside him, with Tom's help. She lays on \n\thim, rubbing him, his hindquarters, his legs, his side, \n\tsoftly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t  TOM\n</b>\t\tNow, listen.

Tom watches, as \n\the cautiously steps further away. Pilgrim looks up at Grace \n\tout of the dark pool of his one sad eye. They look at each \n\tother. And we understand there's a connection once more. A \n\tmoment of understanding... and forgiveness.\n\n\tGrace starts to untie his ropes. Smokey is about to stop her \n\tbut Tom shakes \"NO\"...\n\n\tPilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing \n\tlife for the first time, gets to his feet. Grace and him look \n\tto each other. And all is still.\n\n\tGrace grabs the saddle horn. Pilgrim shuffles as if he's \n\tgoing to bolt. Grace quietly reassures him... She then \n\tcarefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup. Pilgrim \n\tshifts slightly. Annie covers her mouth so as not to scream \n\tout her fear. Robert breaths heavily. They watch as Grace \n\tswings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the \n\tsaddle. Sitting on his back, Pilgrim tosses his head and \n\tlooks as he's going to run off. But Grace puts her arms \n\taround his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him.\n\n\tShe starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, \n\ttalking all the while, around the ring.\n\n\tAnnie laughs as she cries -- emotion overwhelming her. Robert \n\tfeels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion...\n\n\tThe slow ride turns into a trot... then a lope... then a \n\tcanter... round and round the ring. Frank and Diane smile. \n\tDiane looks to Tom and knows what he's feeling...\n\n\tTom watches as any father would -- his heart pounding with \n\tpride for the miracle of his child. But he doesn't let on for \n\ta second.\n\n\tGrace brings Pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the \n\theavens, victorious. Everyone cheers. Smokey helps her off \n\tthe horse. She stops to look at Tom, who busies himself with \n\tpicking up the ropes... So she re-focuses on her parents. They \n\trun to each other and embrace... First, she and Annie... then, \n\tshe and her father...\n\n\tBut, as Robert and Grace hold each other and begins to exit, \n\tAnnie manages to make eye contact with Tom... and tell him \n\twith one look, how grateful she is... and how much she loves \n\thim.

He's deeply in love \n\twith this woman and wants to keep her with him. But there is \n\ta sad resignation in his look. A confusion.\n\n\tHe rises and walks to a stream nearby. He bends down to take \n\tsome water when he hears something. He looks up and sees on \n\tthe other side:\n\n\tA WILD HORSE giving birth to a foal in the tall grass.
