LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a \n               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has \n               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using \n               an empty longneck as his launching tube.\n\n<b>                                     CHILDREN\n</b>                              (all at once)\n                         My turn!

Phil grins. \n               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting \n               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for \n               silence.\n\n<b>                                     PHIL\n</b>                         Okay, okay!

She tosses a beer and \n               Phil catches it.\n\n<b>                                     PHIL\n</b>                         ...just as soon as he completes his \n                         fuel intake.\n\n<b>               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE\n</b>\n               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin \n               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in \n               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. \n               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their \n               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out \n               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of \n               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, \n               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed \n               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads \"BON VOYAGE, \n<b>               MARS ONE!!!\"\n</b>\n<b>                                     WILLIS\n</b>                         It'll take us six months just to get \n                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, \n                         then six months back. That's two \n                         years...\n\n               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, \n               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm \n               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, \n               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, \n               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all \n               too well.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIS\n</b>                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, \n                         since this is my last night on Earth, \n                         it's gonna be a very precious memory \n                         to me. Y'know?\n\n<b>                                     PRETTY GIRL\n</b>                         Nice try, Nick.\n\n               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and \n               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his \n               beer, swigs it.\n\n               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-\n               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has \n               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI \n               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as \n               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily \n               at the chef.\n\n<b>                                     KIROV\n</b>                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't \n                         be heading back to Earth till ten \n                         days after you guys land at our base \n                         camp with Mars Two.

An entire \n               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting \n               this as he smiles at Malik.\n\n<b>                                     WOODY\n</b>                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?\n\n<b>                                     KIROV\n</b>                         Maybe you should bring a baseball \n                         bat. Yes? American baseball?

She pauses to kiss \n               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. \n               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.\n\n<b>                                     TERRI\n</b>                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls \n                         his own strikes.

Red streaks arc high overhead.\n\n               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes \n               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to \n<b>               PRETTY GIRL #2.\n</b>\n<b>                                     WILLIS\n</b>                         Deep space is so lonesome.

Finally he \n               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.\n\n               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around \n               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby \n               on a tripod. He looks lonely.\n\n               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. \n               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at \n               the sky.\n\n<b>                                     BOBBY\n</b>                         Who's gonna read to me now, at \n                         bedtime?\n\n               Luke is surprised by the question.

And what I \n                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring \n                         along my own copy?\n                              (Bobby looks at him)\n                         Then every night, wherever I am, \n                         I'll read a little bit more of it. \n                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, \n                         wherever you are, you're reading it \n                         too.

His eyes, over the thin \n               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. \n               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. \n               They both turn.\n\n               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.\n\n               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.\n\n<b>               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\n               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver \n               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes \n               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. \n               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a \n               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards \n               the party, then pauses again.\n\n               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She \n               smiles tentatively.\n\n               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has \n               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.\n\n               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet \n               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural \n               leader.\n\n               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They \n               separate, looking at each other.

The two men look at each other, the bond between them \n               so strong it needs no words.

Brushing \n               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the \n               ground, packing the sand down with his boot.

HIS POV\n</b>\n               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants \n               have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are \n               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on \n               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through \n               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever \n               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.\n\n<b>               MCCONNELL\n</b>\n               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up \n               before his wondering eyes, dripping.

The dripping \n               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he \n               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, \n               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has \n               come into play. He pauses, looking up...\n\n               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic \n               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in \n               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water \n               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with \n               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.\n\n               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged \n               figure leaps through the foliage!

A blur of flailing arms and fists, as \n               he tries to push the creature away.

His clothes are tattered, patched together. \n               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high \n               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. \n               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.\n\n<b>                                     MCCONNELL\n</b>                         Luke, it's me!

Air. \n               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed \n               another kind of test...\n\n<b>               HIGH, STRIATED WALL\n</b>\n               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled \n               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, \n               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height \n               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the \n               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach \n               ramp, is unmistakable.

She appears benign, \n               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the \n               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to \n               say \"Enter.\" All her motions are both calm and calming -- \n               precise, unhurried, gracious.\n\n<b>               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI\n</b>\n               Look at each other.

Their eyes agree: Let's go.\n\n               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the \n               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, \n               who retreats before them.

We're reminded \n               of Nick Willis just before the vortex exploded him; is the \n               same thing about to happen to McConnell?\n\n               His eyes remain tightly shut, bubbles are streaming from his \n               lips.

NIGHT\n</b>\n               As we MOVE IN CLOSER ON HIS FACE, we suddenly see, with him, \n               a SERIES of rapid-fire, almost subliminal IMAGES FROM THE \n               PAST. We recognize each one. Previously, though, we saw them \n               as still photos; now they have movement, life, and we view \n               them from new and slightly different angles. These images \n               INTERCUT with glimpses of McConnell's pale, shaking, near-\n               death face in the present...\n\n<b>               OMITTED\n</b>\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n<b>               THE YOUNG MCCONNELL\n</b>\n               Under the Christmas tree, lifts his new model rocket from \n               its box.

A man's gloved hand is \n               outstretched, reaching for her. As she grips the hand, we \n               see her triumphant expression through her faceplate. A \n               blinding flash; she's gone...\n\n<b>               MCCONNELL'S FACE - IN THE PRESENT\n</b>\n               Is shaking savagely; he is very near death.

And then, \n               fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his \n               mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe \n               it.\n\n               His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe \n               it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes, \n               the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully \n               trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his \n               eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...\n\n<b>               BRIDAL VEIL IS LIFTED\n</b>\n               And REVEALS, in CLOSEUP, the beautiful face, the shining \n               eyes of MAGGIE McCONNELL. Beatific, eternal. She gazes \n               directly INTO CAMERA, then smiles...\n\n<b>               MCCONNELL\n</b>\n               Smiles back.\n\n<b>               EXT. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. NIGHT\n</b>\n               WIDE VIEW, FROM ABOVE, as the energy vortex changes from red-\n               orange to blue-white. It ROARS with terrifying power as its \n               top starts to bend, angling like a telescope towards a \n               specific point in the stars. Then the Martian ship -- a \n               rounded darker form, little more than a blip within the vast, \n               blue-white column of energy -- shoots away from the surface, \n               leaving only a blacked crater where the Face had been.\n\n<b>               EXT.

Down below, we can see the dust storm in all its \n               vastness still boiling orange and brown across the planet's \n               surface, which it now completely covers.\n\n               As the Martian ship flashes by us, it passes another ship, \n               much smaller and slower, rising through the storm clouds on \n               a different trajectory.
