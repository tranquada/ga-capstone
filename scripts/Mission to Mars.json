LATE AFTERNOON SKY\n\n               Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of \n               sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.\n\n               SUPER TITLE: \"HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020.\"\n\n               As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         T minus ten, nine, eight, start \n                         ignition sequence, five, four, three, \n                         two, one, ignition... Liftoff!\n\n               A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint, \n               ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER, \n               excited SHOUTS.\n\n               EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a \n               gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has \n               got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using \n               an empty longneck as his launching tube.\n\n                                     CHILDREN\n                              (all at once)\n                         My turn! My turn! No, I was next! \n                         No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can \n                         I do one? I want to do one!\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Guys, guys, please! This is risky \n                         stuff here. And I'm a highly trained \n                         professional.\n\n               Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins. \n               There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting \n               poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for \n               silence.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch \n                         another booster...\n\n               Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman, \n               is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and \n               Phil catches it.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         ...just as soon as he completes his \n                         fuel intake.\n\n               ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE\n\n               Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin \n               to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in \n               the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb. \n               DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their \n               families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out \n               blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of \n               balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored, \n               from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed \n               about. A banner, strung between trees, reads \"BON VOYAGE, \n               MARS ONE!!!\"\n\n                                     WILLIS\n                         It'll take us six months just to get \n                         to Mars. Another year on the surface, \n                         then six months back. That's two \n                         years...\n\n               Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut, \n               NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm \n               around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME, \n               ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut, \n               early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all \n               too well.\n\n                                     WILLIS\n                         I guess what I'm trying to say is, \n                         since this is my last night on Earth, \n                         it's gonna be a very precious memory \n                         to me. Y'know?\n\n                                     PRETTY GIRL\n                         Nice try, Nick.\n\n               As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and \n               walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his \n               beer, swigs it.\n\n               ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-\n               pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has \n               paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI \n               KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as \n               they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily \n               at the chef.\n\n                                     KIROV\n                         Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't \n                         be heading back to Earth till ten \n                         days after you guys land at our base \n                         camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty \n                         good long rendezvous.\n\n               WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat \n               over a Hawaiian shirt and a \"KISS THE CHEF\" apron. An entire \n               pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting \n               this as he smiles at Malik.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         What are you suggesting, Sergei?\n\n                                     KIROV\n                         Maybe you should bring a baseball \n                         bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two \n                         crews could have ourselves a little \n                         Solar System Series.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Please. Half you guys are foreigners. \n                         We'd crush you.\n\n                                     KIROV\n                         No, no, we have equal crews. Three \n                         men, one woman. Same handicap.\n\n               He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Easy now, you're talking about my \n                         wife.\n                              (seeing her approach)\n                         And Terri just happens to be one \n                         helluva shortstop.\n\n               DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of \n               corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive \n               by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss \n               Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them. \n               Then she glances at Kirov, all business now.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls \n                         his own strikes. Thousand bucks make \n                         it interesting?\n\n               He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who \n               smiles, nods her cool agreement.\n\n                                     COTE\n                         Eh bien. Winner take all.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Good.\n                              (smiles sweetly at \n                              Kirov)\n                         Bring some balls.\n\n               The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as \n               Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt \n               grin.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         You wanna know the sad part? \n                         Technically I outrank her. But if we \n                         want any peace at all on Mars Two, \n                         I'm gonna be saying a lot of \"Yes, \n                         dears.\"\n\n               The others laugh.\n\n               ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run \n               by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a \n               picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers \n               of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad.\n\n                                     1ST WIFE\n                         ...just not sure how I feel about \n                         NASA allowing couples to go on this \n                         type of mission together.\n\n               One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st \n               Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter.\n\n                                     1ST WIFE\n                              (embarrassed)\n                         Nothing personal, Terri.

Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really \n               have much in common with these women -- before moving on. \n               ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight \n               tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around.\n\n                                     3RD WIFE\n                         Anybody seen Jim McConnell?\n\n                                     4TH WIFE\n                         I don't think he's coming.\n\n                                     1ST WIFE\n                         God, that poor man.

The others nod in \n               agreement, following her glance...\n\n               In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage, \n               his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs \n               which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another \n               figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.\n\n               CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early \n               30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE \n               GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the \n               restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her \n               approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her \n               with an apologetic smile.\n\n                                     DEBRA\n                         He's not coming, Luke.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Jim deserves this, too.

LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still \n               shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.\n\n               In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes \n               Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to \n               PRETTY GIRL #2.\n\n                                     WILLIS\n                         Deep space is so lonesome. So cold. \n                         But I guess I'll have my memories to \n                         keep me warm...\n\n               Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he \n               reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.\n\n               A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around \n               his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby \n               on a tripod. He looks lonely.\n\n               Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him. \n               BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at \n               the sky.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         Who's gonna read to me now, at \n                         bedtime?\n\n               Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Mommy will.\n\n                                     BOBBY\n                         I like when you do it. Now we're \n                         never gonna finish our book.\n\n               His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears. \n               Luke is moved. Another brief silence.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Well, I'll tell you what. I've been \n                         thinking about that. And what I \n                         thought was -- how 'bout if I bring \n                         along my own copy?\n                              (Bobby looks at him)\n                         Then every night, wherever I am, \n                         I'll read a little bit more of it. \n                         And I'll know that you and Mommy, \n                         wherever you are, you're reading it \n                         too. That way, it'll feel like we're \n                         still reading it together. 'Cause I \n                         don't know about you, but I'm pretty \n                         anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn \n                         got marooned on that island. What \n                         d'you say?\n\n               Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better. \n               Luke is proud of his son's courage.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Good deal. Can I have a hug?\n\n               Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke \n               fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin \n               young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence. \n               Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR. \n               They both turn.\n\n               An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.\n\n               Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness.\n\n               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON\n\n               The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver \n               climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes \n               out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon. \n               The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a \n               moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards \n               the party, then pauses again.\n\n               Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She \n               smiles tentatively.\n\n               JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has \n               dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.\n\n               Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet \n               competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural \n               leader.\n\n               Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They \n               separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining.\n\n                                     DEBRA\n                         We were afraid you wouldn't come.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         I caught a whiff of your barbecue. \n                         After that I was helpless.\n\n                                     DEBRA\n                         All the way out in Galveston?\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Something like that.\n                              (she smiles)\n                         It's his night, Deb. I didn't want \n                         to spoil it.\n\n                                     DEBRA\n                         Spoil it? He's been going crazy \n                         looking for you.\n\n               Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around \n               Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them \n               so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are \n                         gonna be mighty glad to see you.\n\n               McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and \n               together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards \n               the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we...\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)\n\n               All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two: \n               McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of \n               the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched \n               behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They \n               zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood.\n\n               EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT\n\n               The yard is nearly deserted. The \"Bon Voyage\" banner has \n               torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a \n               napkin blows across the ground.\n\n               In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the \n               waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.\n\n               CLOSER ON THIS TRIO\n\n               As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a \n               moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the \n               sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots \n               mingling with the silver ones.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                              (abruptly)\n                         I wish we were all going. Together.\n\n               The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even \n               Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Then you've got a short memory.

Just one more time.\n\n               He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once \n               his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions. \n               Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell \n               shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them, \n               walking away a few steps.\n\n               Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance.\n\n               EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n               McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette. \n               McConnell has regained his composure.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time \n                         you donated this thing to a museum?\n\n               Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily.

McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence. \n               Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious.

MARS ONE HAB. DAY\n\n               The crew of Mars One - Kirov, Willis, and Cote -- have joined \n               Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA \n               jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced \n               gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A \n               VIDEO SCREEN\n\n               We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-\n               covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge. \n               What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely \n               protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along \n               the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast \n               to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's \n               more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth, \n               multi-planed symmetry.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         What the hell is that?\n\n                                     COTE\n                         No idea, boss.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Where is it?\n\n               Cote glances at the others.

They beam like cats who ate canaries.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         ...then we've found the key to \n                         permanent human colonization.\n\n               IN THE MMCR\n\n               There's an EXCITED BUZZ among the assembled TECHNICIANS, \n               FLIGHT ENGINEERS, and SCIENTISTS.

He's now the \n               Mars One CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator), and his manner is \n               brisk, efficient, all-business. A TECHNICIAN leans in for \n               instructions.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Tell geology and hydrology we need \n                         to scramble on this. Full-court press.\n\n               The technician nods, hurries away. McConnell, sharing the \n               intense excitement of those around him, stares up at\n\n               THE SCREEN\n\n               Where Luke and his crew are still smiling, well knowing the \n               excitement their bombshell will create.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Anyway, we'are going out to take a \n                         closer look at it, try to get an \n                         idea of its composition.\n                              (checks his watch)\n                         By the time you receive this, we \n                         should be just about on-site.\n\n               EXT. MARS. THE FACE. PLAINS OF CYDONIA. DAY\n\n               The rover is a hundred meters away and moving fast TOWARDS \n               CAMERA. We BOOM DOWN to REVEAL Ares-8, still faithfully \n               holding its point, like an Irish Setter, with its video snout \n               WHIRRING OUT.\n\n               The rover drives up and slows to a stop nearby. The hatch \n               door cracks open and some dust vents out. The door opens all \n               the way and the astronauts climb out. They all look up in \n               awe.

It pierces through \n               the topmost rubble at the near end of the big mountain -- an \n               isolated, butte-like giant, stretching two miles from left \n               to right in front of them.\n\n               THE ASTRONAUTS\n\n               Walk towards the mountain.

SPACE STATION. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MMCR. DAY\n\n               MULTINATIONAL CREWMEMBERS walk by, in the artificial gravity \n               of the busy station, as RAY BECK, mid-50s, approaches from \n               the opposite direction. Beck is the tough, crewcut, PR-savvy \n               head of the NASA Mars Program (ID'd by his name tag), and \n               just now he's leading a covey of U.N. AMBASSADORS on a tour. \n               The ambassadors, of both sexes, many nations, and all races, \n               look as excited as schoolkids.\n\n                                     BECK\n                         ...and this is the Mars Mission \n                         Control Room, nicknamed \"Micker.\" I \n                         understand a comm packet is incoming \n                         from Mars One Base Camp, so you may \n                         find this interesting.\n\n               He opens the doors, ushering his flock inside.\n\n               INT.

Some of them start taking souvenir snaphots. The \n               NIGERIAN AMBASSADOR turns to Beck, whispering curiously.\n\n                                     AMBASSADOR\n                         That man over there.

They hover, then depart, \n               like so many eager bees.\n\n               BECK\n\n               Smiles indulgently at the ambassador's misunderstanding.\n\n                                     BECK\n                         No, actually, that's Jim McConnell, \n                         the CAPCOM.

Jim's been with the manned \n                         Mars program since its inception. \n                         One of our real pioneers.\n\n                                     AMBASSADOR\n                         Will he be going to Mars, too?\n\n                                     BECK\n                         Ah, no. This is as close as he gets.\n\n               ON THE SCREEN\n\n               Luke and his crew have finished eating, and are clearing \n               away their dishes and leftovers.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         ...anyway, that's about it.

End of transmission.\n\n               Luke reaches out, turns OFF the CAMERA, and the display screen \n               GOES BLACK.\n\n               Beck turns, his gaze locking with McConnell's. He's annoyed, \n               as if this violation of protocol were somehow McConnell's \n               fault. McConnell returns his stare coolly.\n\n               EXT. MARS. THE FACE.

We hear a WHOOSH, \n               a mighty rushing of wind, as\n\n               A GIGANTIC, TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER\n\n               Starts to swirl and rise, straight up from the top or the \n               mountain, at its center. As it swirls, the cylinder picks up \n               debris -- pebbles, sand -- from the sediment-encrusted surface \n               of the slopes.\n\n               THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS\n\n               Stare up at this spectacle, awed.

As it rises, it gains speed and power, narrowing \n               at its top into a conical vortex. It's sucking up so much \n               dirt, so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that the \n               accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling, translucent \n               outer \"skin\".\n\n               THE ASTRONAUTS\n\n               Exchange amazed glances.

More violent.\n\n               LUKE IS ALARMED\n\n               And the spell is broken. He keys his throat mike, his lips \n               moving, but no sound can be heard over the ROARING WIND. He \n               waves his arms, motioning for the others to back away, towards \n               the rover.

In fact \n               he's busily snapping photographs of the cylinder.

Seeking them. And \n               then, with horrifying precision, it locks in on the little \n               group of astronauts. And lunges towards them...\n\n               EXT. MARS. THE FACE.

Blood sprays into the wind, immediately \n               crystallizing, in the sub-zero atmosphere, into red pellets...\n\n               LUKE, HORRIFIED, FLINGS HIS ARM UP\n\n               As bloody hail patters against his faceplate and forearm.

NEXT MORNING\n\n               CLOSE ON A DIGITAL CLOCK\n\n               Just turning over to read \"0545.\"\n\n               TERRI\n\n               Pulls her gaze away from these numbers. Judging from her \n               redrimmed eyes, it's been a long, anxious night. Restlessly, \n               looking to distract herself, she reaches for a test tube of \n               blood, straps it into a centrifuge, sets it spinning. Nearby \n               is her electron microscope.\n\n               MCCONNELL (LOWER HAB)\n\n               Lies on his cot in his own cubicle, with the door closed. \n               The lower hab has artificial gravity (AG) and McConnell can \n               move normally. Hands behind his head, he stares at his bureau.\n\n               PHOTO OF A WOMAN\n\n               Rests there, in its leather travel frame. Beautiful, smiling, \n               dark-haired: MAGGIE MCCONNELL. Her face glows with \n               intelligence and energy.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Shifts his eyes. The clock on his bulkhead reads \"0546.\"\n\n               PHIL (LOWER HAB)\n\n               Stands in the communal bathroom, still in his pajamas, a \n               towel around his shoulders, brushing his teeth. He glances \n               at another digital clock, which reads \"0547.\" Shakes his \n               head impatiently. He looks back into the mirror, then is \n               surprised to hear MUSIC lilting incongruously over the \n               loudspeakers: Elvis Presley's \"Blue Moon.\"\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT.

He grins, charmed by the sight of\n\n               WOODY AND TERRI DANCING\n\n               Like a weightless Fred and Ginger. Woody is surprisingly \n               good at this. Enthusiastic, unselfconscious.\n\n               He sweeps Terri gallantly about the little cabin, pushing \n               off from every handy surface, even guiding her into some \n               passable twirls and dips. She laughs, shaking her head.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         What brought this on?\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Zero-G.

A \n               twinge of sadness crosses his features. But when his eyes \n               meet Phil's, he shakes off the feeling and manages a smile: \n               Aren't they something?\n\n               Over the music, they hear a CHIRP from the SHIP'S COMPUTER, \n               then an announcement.\n\n                                     COMPUTER\n                         Attention.

The \n               frame moves over the terrain in the direction of the Face, \n               first in SWIFT BLURS, then slowing. Scattered rock debris \n               come into view. The IMAGE ARRIVES where the mountain was, \n               and they see...\n\n               Debris in every direction, NEAT SPIRALS of it now, dropped \n               uncannily into place, like some massive earth sculpture.

Both in Air Force flight suits, helmets in hand. \n               Suntanned, cocky, flashing radiant smiles.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         When they met at the Air Force \n                         Academy, it was \"love at first \n                         flight.\"\n\n               GROANS and LAUGHTER from the offscreen watchers.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         After that, NASA training was tough. \n                         All Jim could think about was \n                         exploring a heavenly body. More ribald \n                         LAUGHTER, as\n\n               FOURTH PHOTO APPEARS\n\n               Maggie and Jim, tethered together, floating weightlessly in \n               space suits.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         But Maggie, as you can see, kept him \n                         on a short leash. Until...\n\n               A FIFTH PHOTO\n\n               Shows McConnell, in a dress uniform, leaning in to kiss \n               Maggie, who wears a white bridal gown.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Mission accomplished!\n\n               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, IN THE PRESENT\n\n               As he smiles at this, hearing the renewed LAUGHTER and CHEERS, \n               the AD-LIBBED DIGS from the video. He becomes aware he's not \n               alone. He looks up.\n\n               WOODY\n\n               Stands in the doorway of his cubicle. Their eyes meet. They \n               both smile, turning back to the video. Remembering.\n\n               IN THE VIDEO\n\n               Luke and Woody have stepped forward, INTO SHOT, standing at \n               the sides of the TV, where the last photo lingers. Luke waves \n               his hands, hushing everybody.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Today we celebrate a new chapter in \n                         their story.

Evidently a photo taken in the surf \n               somewhere, but here it's been crudely superimposed onto a \n               Martian landscape. Laughter greets this unlikely image.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         When you guys land, it'll prove once \n                         and for all there's no intelligent \n                         life on Mars.\n\n               More hoots of LAUGHTER, CATCALLS, but Maggie jumps in to \n               protest, as the VIDEOCAMERA SWINGS TO HER AND JIM. Terri \n               sits nearby.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         Hey, c'mon, what if I'm right?\n\n                                     ASSORTED VOICES\n                         Oh no, here we go!

Mars is a great opportunity \n                         for pure science.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         We'll do the science. And we'll do \n                         it very well. That's what we've \n                         trained for. But what if there's \n                         more...? In all our myths, in every \n                         human culture, Mars has always held \n                         a special attraction. What if that \n                         means something? Only we don't \n                         understand it yet...\n\n               The mood of the party is changing, as everyone is caught up \n               in Maggie's spell. She has a radiant simplicity. The VIDEO \n               CAMERA DRIFTS IN ON HER; we are caught up, too.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         The universe is not chaos. It's \n                         connection. Life reaches out for \n                         life...\n\n               She looks at McConnell, smiles. He takes her hand.\n\n                                     MAGGIE\n                         This is what we were born for, isn't \n                         it? To stand on a new world, and \n                         look beyond it to the next one. It's \n                         who we are.\n\n               A silence; the guests are enchanted by the purity of her \n               passion. She smiles, suddenly self-conscious. She hadn't \n               meant to get so carried away.\n\n               IN THE PRESENT - MCCONNELL\n\n               Reaches out, gently taps the keyboard, FREEZING the screen. \n               He and Woody, their eyes shining, stare at her image. A beat.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         You okay?\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Yeah. I'm good to go.\n\n               Woody glances at him. It's true. Rather than being saddened, \n               McConnell seems to have taken on new strength. A renewed \n               sense of wonder.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         After all these years... Can you \n                         believe it? Tomorrow we'll be standing \n                         on Mars.\n\n               Woody nods, smiles.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         You know what? She may have been \n                         right.\n\n               McConnell looks at him.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         If that wasn't a quake down there, \n                         then something else caused it. Or \n                         planned it... You're thinking the \n                         same thing.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         It's never been out of my mind.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Jesus. You realize what this means?\n\n               McConnell nods. Looks again at Maggie's face on the screen.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         She knew, Woody. She was the only \n                         one of us that ever thought there \n                         might be something down there.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Yeah, and we're not leaving until we \n                         find out... Deal?\n\n               McConnell nods. They clasp hands briefly. Deal. Then Woody \n               turns. Before leaving, he hesitates just a moment, turning \n               back. One last thought, and he doesn't know he's going to \n               say it until it comes out.\n\n                                     WOODY\n                         Maggie was the best of us.\n\n               McConnell looks at him, silent but grateful. Woody goes. \n               McConnell turns back, looking at her smiling face, frozen on \n               the screen.\n\n               INT. COCKPIT.

NIGHT\n\n               McConnell hovers by a bulkhead. He's anguished, haunted by \n               the image of Woody's death. We see him struggling to overcome \n               his grief and shock, trying to force himself to concentrate \n               on the critical tasks at hand. In front of him, a panel has \n               been opened; he's facing\n\n               SMALL UTILITY MONITOR\n\n               Already glowing, surrounded by coded switches, indicator \n               lights, com ports.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Stares at these, thinking hard, remembering. He's holding a \n               palm-sized computer, already wired into this panel. He begins \n               tapping the keys, but then stops himself. Reconsiders. He \n               turns, looking back at\n\n               TERRI AND PHIL\n\n               Hunched on what would be the floor if the REMO were on land. \n               They grip stowage straps to keep from drifting. Clearly this \n               tiny, rude cargo craft was never designed for manned \n               operation. It's claustrophobic, bitterly cold.\n\n               PHIL'S FACE\n\n               Is a map of torment. He is shivering, both from cold and \n               fear, barely holding himself together. He hugs his computer \n               supply case like a scared child would hug a teddy bear.\n\n               TERRI\n\n               Is worse. A thousand-yard stare.

I need to get \n                         on the data bus, put in a software \n                         patch, and try to soften this tin \n                         can's landing. I could use your help \n                         with the patch.\n\n               After a moment Phil releases his strap, pushes towards \n               McConnell. He stares numbly at the monitor for a few beats, \n               then takes the little computer from McConnell. He begins to \n               tap the keys, slowly at first, but then with more confidence.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         That's great.

Think \n                         maybe we could rig some kind of \n                         seatbelts out of those cargo straps?\n\n               Terri hesitates a moment, then looks at the strap in her \n               hand, as if she's never seen it before. Dully she reaches \n               for another one, begins looping them together.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Studies both of their faces intently. Knows that he can't \n               push them too hard, too fast. They're moving like robots, \n               but at least they're moving.\n\n               EXT. REMO. MARS ORBIT. NIGHT.

DAY\n\n               POV ANGLE - WIDE\n\n               As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the \n               distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff, \n               the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.\n\n               PANNING\n\n               We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well \n               as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse, \n               and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant \n               are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by \n               micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze. \n               And finally,\n\n               CLOSER TO CAMERA\n\n               We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole, \n               but nearly obliterated by sand.\n\n               ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL\n\n               Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the \n               edge of the camp.\n\n               They have dragged along with them from their landing site a \n               crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and \n               some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.\n\n               McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep \n               their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing \n               off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the \n               ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a \n               moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist.

After a seeming eternity, the door groans and creaks \n               open.

DAY\n\n               AN INNER AIRLOCK DOOR WHOOSHES OPEN, AND MCCONNELL ENTERS. \n               THEN STOPS, ASTONISHED. HIS POV\n\n               On a fantastic, almost jungle-like atmosphere. The plants \n               have been allowed -- encouraged? -- to grow wildly. Some are \n               even pushing against the inflated roof. Water condenses on \n               the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through \n               pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever \n               assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up \n               before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication, \n               he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.\n\n               Blinking red letters read \"25 deg. C.\" And something else -- \n               the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly \n               deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in \n               here!\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:\n\n               \"Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%.\"\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Slowly reaches up, unsealing the neck ring of his helmet. He \n               hesitates, then lifts it off. Takes a deep, quenching lungful \n               of pure air. Holds it in. Lets it slowly out. For a moment \n               he doesn't trust his own voice. Then speaks softly towards \n               his helmet.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         I'm in the greenhouse.

Through the distant, \n               translucent wall of the greenhouse, McConnell's shadowy figure \n               can be seen, moving slowly.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Jim...?\n\n               INT. GREENHOUSE. DAY\n\n               McConnell sets down his helmet, starts exploring, pushing \n               through fronds as he makes his way down an aisle. The dripping \n               foliage is so dense it almost chokes his path. Everywhere he \n               looks, he has the sense of a scrounged-together, recycled, \n               jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has \n               come into play. He pauses, looking up...\n\n               Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic \n               tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in \n               the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water \n               wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with \n               duct tape, like some giant Erector set.\n\n               As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged \n               figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with \n               a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.\n\n               McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights \n               back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as \n               he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a \n               glimpse of the almost unrecognizable\n\n               LUKE GRAHAM\n\n               Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a swaying \n               curtain of dreadlocks. His skin is creased, weathered, above \n               a scraggly beard. His clothes are tattered, patched together. \n               In one fist he grips a rock hammer, which he swings high \n               overhead, about to drive the claw through McConnell's skull. \n               McConnell grabs his arm desperately, trying to fend him off.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Luke, it's me! Jim McConnell!\n\n               We see a flash of uncertainty in Luke's eyes. Then he yanks \n               his arm free, and his hammer arcs up even higher, trembles \n               in the air.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         You're not here!\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Luke, it's Jim!\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         No, no, you're not... you can't be \n                         here.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Your wife is Debra!

McConnell \n               scrambles to his feet.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         Don't hurt him!\n\n               McConnell kneels beside Luke, signalling to Terri and Phil \n               that it's okay to let him go. They stand back, pulling off \n               their helmets. Everyone is panting, out of breath.\n\n               Luke sits up, slowly studying their features, one after \n               another, as if still not quite certain whether they might \n               vanish. His voice is hoarse, rusty from disuse.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Phil...

He \n               looks to Terri, who looks down.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Oh no.\n\n               Luke shakes his head in dismay. He seems to shrink in on \n               himself. It's all too much for him to take in. McConnell \n               kneels and puts his arm around Luke, comforting him.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               INT.

The sky beyond the Face is almost black, as the \n               storm approaches from that direction. It's marching \n               relentlessly across the planet, with flashes of lightning \n               now rippling up and down its face, and even small tornadoes \n               spinning off near its purple-black base...\n\n               INT.

They take a sort of collective breath. \n               Then they walk forward together, into the light.\n\n               INT. THE FACE. DUSK\n\n               The astronauts continue forward, each of them extending a \n               free hand.\n\n               The light is too dazzling for them to gauge distances, \n               textures, colors -- anything at all.

In a few moments, all \n               three helmets are off. They hold them, glowing softly, against \n               their chests, as they breathe deeply and gratefully. Air. \n               And then, at this very moment, as if they have just passed \n               another kind of test...\n\n               HIGH, STRIATED WALL\n\n               Appears through the glare, soaring up before their startled \n               eyes. White, metallic, composed of complexly-linked bands, \n               plates, ramps. It's part of a STRUCTURE whose overall height \n               and breadth keep us from understanding its purpose. But the \n               hatch opening slowly in its side, at the top of an approach \n               ramp, is unmistakable. Radiant white light streams out from \n               within, forming a glowing tunnel, down towards the astronauts.\n\n               THE ASTRONAUTS BLINK\n\n               Raising their gloves against the dazzling glow. At the end \n               of this tunnel of light, inside the hatch frame\n\n               A SHAPE MATERIALIZES\n\n               And slowly resolves itself into a glowing humanoid form, \n               which we somehow sense is female. She appears benign, \n               wondrous. This glowing MARTIAN -- a holograph -- regards the \n               astronauts for a few moments, then beckons to them, as if to \n               say \"Enter.\" All her motions are both calm and calming -- \n               precise, unhurried, gracious.\n\n               MCCONNELL, LUKE AND TERRI\n\n               Look at each other. They're awed into silence, and still \n               tense, but now more out of excitement and anticipation than \n               fear. Their eyes agree: Let's go.\n\n               They walk forward slowly, carrying their helmets, up the \n               ramp and into the tunnel of light, following the Martian, \n               who retreats before them. They go through the hatch and \n               disappear inside.\n\n               INT. MARTIAN STRUCTURE. DUSK\n\n               Following the Martian, they find themselves in a round, open \n               space, defined by light, with a smooth matte-metallic floor, \n               but without apparent walls.\n\n               The Martian stops, turns, facing them. The astronauts stop, \n               too, uncertain what they're meant to do. Then the Martian \n               gestures again.\n\n               A cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the \n               floor in front of the astronauts. Inside it, a swirl of eerie \n               lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies...\n\n               MCCONNELL, LUKE, AND TERRI\n\n               Set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this \n               column, forming a loose triangle.

Graphics show \n               a model of what the ship contains: the familiar double helix \n               of DNA.

The astronauts are left staring \n               at each other across the open space where the column had \n               been.\n\n               THE MARTIAN\n\n               Now comes forward with outstretched arms and completes their \n               circle, taking the fourth position. McConnell is opposite \n               her glowing form, and Terri and Luke are at either side. The \n               Martian reaches her arms out, inviting them to link hands. \n               As they do so, the Martian seems to be staring directly into \n               McConnell's eyes.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Is in wondrous awe, his whole face radiant with joy.

The first multi-celled \n                         plants and animals appeared. No one \n                         has ever understood why...\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         They seeded Earth.\n\n               We hear a BELL-LIKE TONE, a single lingering high note, and \n               simultaneously the outermost ring of the circle on the floor \n               begins to glow brightly. It is an intense chromium yellow.\n\n               THE ASTRONAUTS\n\n               Step back, startled, unlinking their hands, and look at the \n               circle of colored rings. These shade from yellow, on the \n               outer rim, to a deeper yellow, then orange, then finally \n               reds. Inside the final, deep red ring is a circle of indigo \n               blue, about a meter across. Small points of light glitter \n               here, like stars against a midnight sky.\n\n               THE MARTIAN\n\n               Steps closer to McConnell. She has picked him out in \n               particular. Now she beckons for him to move inside the circle \n               of colored rings, to stand on the indigo core.\n\n               MCCONNELL\n\n               Looks back at her, nods his understanding. For the first \n               time she seems to smile. Benevolence, reassurance. Then as \n               abruptly as she first appeared, she fades away. Vanishes.\n\n               Luke and Terri look at McConnell, confused. There is a sudden, \n               static-filled CRACKLE from their helmets, nearby on the floor.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                              (over radio)\n                         ...in, please. Can you... me?\n\n               Terri picks up her helmet, leans into its mike.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Phil, we're here! We read you.\n\n               Even through the scratchy interference, they can hear the \n               relief in Phil's voice. And then the desperation.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Thank God!

His signal is lost.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Phil? Phil...?\n\n               Suddenly the BELL-LIKE TONE REPEATS, at a lower register, \n               with a more sustained note, and simultaneously, the last of \n               the yellow circles of light begins to fade, as\n\n               THE FIRST ORANGE BAND\n\n               Begins to glow brighter. McConnell turns, looking at this \n               new color, then looks back at Luke and Terri.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         We are in a ship.

As he catches \n               it, she's already starting back out, in the direction they \n               came from, and Luke follows her. Until they both become aware \n               that McConnell isn't with them. They turn back. He's still \n               rooted to the spot, his gaze locked on the indigo core of \n               the colored rings.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Jim...\n\n               McConnell doesn't turn.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Jim, we gotta go.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         I'm not coming with you.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                              (stunned)\n                         What?\n\n               Coming back, she sees how calm he is. How certain.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         What are you talking about? We've \n                         got to get home.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         That's where I'm going. Don't you \n                         see? That's what all this is for.\n                              (McConnell gestures \n                              at the ship around \n                              them)\n                         You were right Terri. This is an \n                         invitation. To follow them. To follow \n                         them home.\n\n               He looks into their faces. Terri is trying to grasp this \n               idea, still incredulous. Luke has the beginning of a half \n               smile.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         I have to go. This is the mission \n                         now. To find out who we are. Isn't \n                         that why we came here? Like Maggie \n                         said, \"To stand on a new world and \n                         look beyond it to the next one.\"\n\n               Luke nods at the memory of Maggie's words. Terri remembers \n               too. McConnell's passionate conviction is affecting them \n               both.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         You know, when you think about it -- \n                         I wasn't even supposed to be here -- \n                         all the accidents, everything that \n                         got us to this point, it's just... \n                         it's just... I just know it's right.\n\n               Terri looks at Luke. Luke is smiling. He understands.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         I'm okay.

But in this moment is a \n               lifetime of camaraderie, an eternity of farewell.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Thanks for saving my life.\n\n                                     MCCONNELL\n                         My pleasure.\n\n               Luke nods, deeply moved. He turns away, picking up his helmet, \n               as Terri comes closer, looking at McConnell, a long unspoken \n               beat. Her eyes are glistening.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         I wish Woody were here to see this. \n                         He would've wanted to go too, Jim.\n\n               Terri smiles.

She hands it to McConnell, and his fist closes \n               around it.\n\n                                     TERRI\n                         Take care, Jim.\n\n               McConnell smiles.

As we watch, more fiery streaks \n               begin to emerge from the sides of the Face, from the chin, \n               cheeks and temples. These all rush upwards, like lava flowing \n               uphill, gathering in intensity as they leap free of the Face \n               itself and spiral into the atmosphere.

Look at that.\n\n               Through their cockpit window, they watch the Martian ship \n               hurtle by them at a hundred times their speed.\n\n                                     PHIL\n                         Is that him?\n\n               Luke nods. Their eyes are glistening. Luke's voice is a \n               whisper, both of prayer and farewell.\n\n                                     LUKE\n                         Godspeed Jim McConnell.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               OMITTED\n\n               Sequence omitted from original script.\n\n               EXT. SPACE\n\n               Looking through the cockpit window we see the Martian ship \n               receding into the infinite distance of space -- a long blue-\n               white scratch that in moments begins to fade. Finally it is \n               a tiny point of light, taking its place amongst the limitless \n               expanse of the star-filled heavens.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMission to Mars\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Lowell Cannon\u00a0\u00a0Jim Thomas\u00a0\u00a0John Thomas\u00a0\u00a0Graham Yost\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:31:29.605771"}
