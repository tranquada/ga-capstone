I'd like to think I have built\n           the club into a family and there must\n           be sadness when anybody leaves a\n           family.

Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.\n     Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his\n     coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His\n     assassins. His \"Goodfellas\".

Goal Leeds. REVIE and\n     his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.\n\n     TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out\n     encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the\n     game restarts..\n\n                          TAYLOR (cont'd)\n             C'mon, keep your shape!

Celebrating.\n\n     The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,\n     \"Beeeeeep\", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in\n     disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.\n\n     The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.\n\n     CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking\n     PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the\n     manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds\n     already on their next game...\n\n     CLOUGH stares as they go..\n\n                                                                          16aA\n\n\n25   INT.

Another\n     player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..\n\n     \"CRUNCH\", a bone-shaking tackle from \"BITES YER LEGS\".\n\n                          CLOUGH (cont'd)\n             Oh, Jeeeeeesussss!!!\n\n     CLOUGH is flattened.
