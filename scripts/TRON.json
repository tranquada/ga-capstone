In the\n         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer\n         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually\n         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice\n         speaking.\n\n<b>                               VOICE\n</b>                    As astonishing advances in computer\n                    science are made, artificial intelligence\n                    programs are being designed to assist\n                    us in every area of life...\n\n         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,\n         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and\n         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by\n         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.\n\n<b>                               VOICE (CONT.)\n</b>                    In a world-wide network of electronics,\n                    they travel through miles of circuitry\n                    at the speed of light. We created them to\n                    calculate and research, to help us design\n                    and heal and think. With all that they can\n                    do, are they only electrical impulses...\n                    or are they a new form of life?\n\n         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face\n         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the\n         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves\n         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.\n         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place\n         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,\n         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of\n         the screen in huge letters.\n\n<b>                                    T R O N ! !\n</b>\n         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has\n         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as\n         if it had an inner core of electricity.\n\n         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the\n         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the\n         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.\n\n\n         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the\n         electronic information in our computers, television sets and\n         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,\n         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first\n         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through\n         the window of television screens.\n\n\n<b>                                                   CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2\n</b>\n         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a\n         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER\n         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely\n         encasing them.\n\n\n<b>                                                   CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3\n</b>\n\n         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser\n         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the\n         other.\n\n\n<b>                                                   CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4\n</b>\n\n         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,\n         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.\n\n\n<b>    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5\n</b>\n\n         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,\n         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR\n         electronic beeping and popping.\n\n\n<b>    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6\n</b>\n\n         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like\n         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to\n         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound\n         like a crack of lightning.\n\n\n<b>    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7\n</b>\n\n         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of\n         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D\n         maze.\n\n\n<b>    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9\n</b>\n\n<b>    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10\n</b>\n         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing\n         glowing disks at one another like frisbees.

A version of\n         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space\n         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy\n         at each other.\n\n<b>    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14\n</b>\n\n         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head\n         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue.

The \"firing\" end of the giant\n         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical\n         plat-form -- empty.\n\n\n<b>                               LORA\n</b>                    Let me make sure we're running\n\n\n         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby.

For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly\n         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then\n         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,\n         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second\n         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a\n         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,\n         five feet from its original position.

We get the\n         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,\n         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,\n         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared\n         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,\n         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and\n         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below\n         and beyond.\n\n\n         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for\n         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.\n\n\n<b> 334-349 OMIT                                                         334-349\n</b>\n<b>    350  THE CENTRAL CHAMBER                                          350\n</b>\n\n         of the I/0 Tower.

A square, secondary altar\n         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.\n\n\n         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing\n         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded\n         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower\n         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but\n         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,\n         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped\n         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,\n         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed\n         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is\n         only blackness beyond.\n\n\n<b>    351  DUMONT'S FACE                                                351\n</b>\n         asleep.\n\n<b>    352  REVERSE ANGLE                                                352\n</b>\n\n         Tron and Yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide\n         room, their footsteps ECHOING.\n\n<b> 353-374 OMIT                                                         353-374\n</b>\n<b>    375  CENTRAL CHAMBER - TRON, YORI, DUMONT                         375\n</b>\n         Tron and Yori stop at the foot of Dumont's altar.\n\n\n<b>                               YORI\n</b>                             (quietly)\n                    Dumont... ?\n\n\n         The priest's eyes flicker open.
