Ma Bell or AT&T.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          The Great American Insurance\n          Company. I'm part of the big,\n          evil, corporate establishment that,\n          let me guess, you think is the\n          cause of every evil thing in the\n          world from Vietnam to diaper rash.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          You left out bad breath.\n          Falling for it, Harvey covers his mouth. Scott laughs. They\n          both smile, realizing they share a wry sense of humor.\n          A TRAIN IS COMING, Harvey has to work fast.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          So... You're not going to let me\n          celebrate my birthday all by myself\n          are you?\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          (gently teasing)\n          Listen, Harvey, you're kind of cute\n          for a suit...

HARVEY'S NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          Harvey feeds Scott spoonfuls of CREAM PIE from a TRAY FULL of\n          FOOD that rests on the bed between them. Ice cream, cookies,\n          milk, berries... It's over the top and adorable.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Where are you from?\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Well, this isn't Jackson, but you\n          still can't respond to every\n          strange man you meet on a subway\n          platform. It's too dangerous.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Now you tell me.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          There's nothing tougher than a New\n          York City cop. They're arrogant,\n          and they're everywhere. I'll show\n          you the cruising spots, if you\n          want, if you promise you'll be\n          careful... little Scottie-san.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Are you on uppers or what?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          No. This is just... plain old me.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          You're afraid of the cops?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'm just discreet. I know a lot of\n          people here. If they found out, I\n          could lose my job.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          (meaning a closet case)\n          Oh. You're one of \"those.\"\n          (examines Harvey's eyes)\n          I think you need a change of\n          scenery.

I won't make\n          it to fifty.\n          Scott distracts him, playful, like a newlywed at a wedding,\n          he rubs a slice of pie in Harvey's face.\n          Harvey reacts. Wipes the pie from his eye, and tackles his\n          young, frisky new lover. They kiss. The mess getting\n          everywhere. Harvey brushes it out of Scott's hair.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          (an idea, half-jokingly,\n\n          HALF-SERIOUSLY)\n          Why don't we run away together?\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Where to?\n\n          16 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT\n\n          RETURN TO: Harvey speaks to the tape recorder. (Throughout\n          the film, these scenes should feel intimate, as if Harvey is\n          telling us things no one else knows.)\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          In those days, San Francisco was\n          the place where everyone wanted to\n          go...

Crime-filled. Drug-filled. The\n          new place for us refugees was this\n          run down Irish Catholic\n          neighborhood in Eureka Valley. Six\n          blocks square... The Castro.\n\n          17 EXT.

Harvey snaps PHOTOS of his\n          face, an expression of distrust.\n          Harvey SNAPS a SIGN in the liquor shop window that reads:\n\n          \"EUREKA VALLEY MERCHANTS SOCIETY.\"\n          Harvey's CAMERA focuses on TWO CUTE, YOUNG, HIPPIE BOYS\n          WALKING PAST, one puts his arm over the other. To Harvey's\n          eyes it's a very new site. It's overt. Thrilling.\n          Harvey snaps a photo of an empty storefront with a FOR RENT\n          SIGN hanging out front.\n\n          19 INT.

He begins SNAPPING PHOTOS of him.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          I suppose I can wait tables.\n\n          HARVEY\n          No way. I want you right here with\n          me...

Not\n          too much work... A little one, just\n          like Morris and Minnie Milk of\n          Woodmere, New York...\n\n          20 EXT. CASTRO STREET CAMERA SHOP - DAY (1973)\n\n          Harvey's empty store front has been converted to a CAMERA\n          STORE (with a few, not very impressive, products).\n          Harvey is out on the sidewalk directing Scott who is inside\n          the store's large window hanging a sign: \"CASTRO CAMERA.\"\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Just a little to the left...\n          The old liquor store owner from earlier, MCCONNELLY, crosses\n          the street to watch.

McConnelly shakes, but is wary.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          I want to join the, um... What is\n          it? The Eureka Valley Merchant's\n          Association.

I'm no interloper.\n          A Jew perhaps, but I hope you'll\n          forgive that.\n          McConnelly looks from Harvey to Scott in the window.\n\n          MCCONNELLY\n          I don't think your application will\n          be approved, Mr. Milk. This is a\n          family neighborhood. Your kind are\n          far more welcome on Haight street.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (trying to keep it friendly)\n          What \"kind\" do you mean, sir?\n\n          MCCONNELLY\n          (not playing along)\n          The Merchant's Association will\n          have the police pull your license\n          if you open your doors.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Based on what law?\n\n          MCCONNELLY\n          There's man's law and there's God's\n          law in this neighborhood and in this\n          City. The San Francisco Police\n          force is happy to enforce either.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (to McConnelly as he walks away)\n          Thanks for the warm welcome to the\n          neighborhood!\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          We pay taxes you know!\n          Harvey grabs Scott's hand... keeps him from heating up, from\n          pouncing.

Revitalize it...\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Can I come in now?\n\n          HARVEY MILK (O.S.)\n          One more minute!\n          (back to his new scheme)\n          I'll go to the neighborhood banks.\n          They must have some gay customers.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Harvey. What's with all this\n          political activist crap? I thought\n          you were a goddamn Republican.\n          Harvey walks into the small dining room holding two plates of\n          food. He sets them out on a small dining room table, still\n          rambling on to Scott in the bedroom.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'm a businessman, Scott. I think\n          businesses ought to treat their\n          customers right. Even their gay\n          customers. For God's sake, this is\n          San Francisco!\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Harvey. It's just like every other\n          city in this country. People hate\n          us. Big surprise.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          We should have at least one block\n          in one city right? Start there and\n          take over the neighborhood.\n          (a smile)\n          Okay, you can come in now!\n          Scott heads toward the kitchen. The table is LAID OUT with a\n          home-cooked meal, CANDLES and a huge bouquet of FLOWERS.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Wow. This is--\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          11.\n          Harvey SMASHES A CREAM PIE into Scott's face. Payback.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Happy birthday!\n          Scott chases Harvey around the apartment, trying to smear\n          some of the CREAM PIE onto him.\n\n          22 EXT. THE CASTRO - DAY\n\n          The street is shut down for the first ever Castro Street\n          Fair. The crowd is mostly gay, the majority congregate\n          outside Toad Hall bar.\n          ANGLE ON: SOME OF THE OLD-SCHOOL, IRISH LOCALS milling about,\n          eyeing the scene skeptically.\n          Harvey MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD with Scott, shaking hands.\n\n          MAN ON THE STREET\n          Thanks for the party, Mr. Milk!\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Thanks for joining the Castro\n          Village Association!\n          Harvey arrives at A LONG LINE OF GAY MEN winding out of the\n          Irish liquor store (from earlier). He squeezes past them,\n          into the store, leaving Scott outside.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          Excuse me gentleman... ladies.\n          (finding the shop owner)\n          Hello! Mr. McConnelly!\n          McConnelly, at the register, is overwhelmed with all the new\n          business.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          I just wanted to stop in and see\n          how business was doing.\n\n          MCCONNELLY\n          Fine.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          So you don't mind all these\n          homosexuals in here, do you?\n          McConnelly grins, uncomfortable. The line of gay men is\n          curious about the hubbub. Point made, Harvey does a 180.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          12.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          No. No. Just a joke. Mr. McConnelly\n          here loves our kind. Spend away!\n          (to McConnelly)\n          Tell your wife Hello for me.\n          Harvey spots Scott in the crowd and PULLS HIM TOWARD HIM,\n          KISSING HIM ON THE MOUTH. It's quite the show. They step\n          back out onto the street where an Irish band is now playing.\n          Gay men watch. Some clap. Harvey grabs Scott and spins him\n          through a sharp waltz. OFF the pair at home in their new\n          neighborhood.\n\n          23 INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT\n\n\n           HARVEY MILK\n          And people started hanging around\n          our store. Not customers.\n          Activists, kids, folks who needed a\n          home away from home...\n\n          26 EXT. CASTRO CAMERA - INTERCUT\n\n          A NEW sign goes in the window: \"We are VERY open.\"\n\n          27 INT. CASTRO CAMERA SHOP - DAY\n\n          A FEW YOUNG MEN are hanging out in the shop, the beginnings\n          of Harvey's entourage. Harvey moves among them, sharing a\n          clipped Sunday cartoon, lecturing them on politics or the\n          arts, and checking out the cute ones.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)\n          There was Danny Niccoletta, a cute\n          art student who I'd picked up at\n          Toad Hall. Turns out he was also\n          good at running the Camera Shop...\n          something Scott and I found we had\n          surprising little interest in...\n          ON DANNY NICCOLETTA, young, waif-like, somewhat helpless.\n\n          DANNY NICCOLETTA\n          Opera is passe, Harvey. It's about\n          street theater, now.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          What you're not getting is the\n          spectacle of it, the bigger than\n          life emotions...\n          Danny jumps up and IMITATES the LARGER THAN LIFE GESTURES of\n          an opera diva, making Harvey laugh.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          13.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          Jim Rivaldo. A great mind. A great\n          wit. A Harvard graduate, which\n          nobody cared about, in those days,\n          in the Castro... including himself.\n          JIM RIVALDO flops down into the vintage dental chair that\n          sits in front of Harvey's desk. He seems to be looking for\n          something to occupy his keen mind. A sharply dressed young\n          man, 20s, DICK PABICH, walks up to peek over his shoulder.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          And somewhere along the line Jim\n          picked up a protege, a cute\n          political kid from Wisconsin... Dick\n          Pabich... And of course there was\n          Dennis Peron, who ran a very popular\n          business with the new kids...\n          DENNIS PERON hands Scott a FREE JOINT.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n          And on occasion we actually had a\n          real customer. But only occasionally.\n          ACROSS THE ROOM, Scott is waiting on a CUSTOMER, he's out of\n          place: straight, gruff, a union man, ALLAN BAIRD, 40s.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Harvey... This guy wants to talk to\n          you.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (approaches Allan)\n          Welcome. What can we do for you?\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          Hi, I'm Allan Baird. Teamsters\n          representative, and Director of the\n          Coors beer boycott in California.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Everyone, this is Allan Baird. He's\n          a very big deal, so behave\n          yourselves.\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          I was told you were like the Mayor\n          of the Castro, said you organized\n          the CVA, you might know some people\n          in the bars.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          14.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I do have friends in awfully low\n          places, but just so you know, it's\n          not official yet.\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          What's that?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          The Mayor part. I've considered\n          gathering an army of queers to\n          march up to City Hall and secede,\n          but so far the young gays seem more\n          interested in jeeps and jeans. But\n          if I could be of any use, I'm all\n          ears!\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          We can't get Coors to go union.\n          These guys are like me, they can't\n          be out of work too long.\n          Harvey pulls Allan aside, away from the audience, easing his\n          nerves. It's Harvey at his best.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'm just curious. Are we your first\n          stop or your last?\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          (clearly his last)\n          It's been a tough one, Mr. Milk.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Well, you seem to have noticed that\n          my kind of people drink a lot of\n          beer. If we're going to fast for\n          your sake, I think we should get to\n          deliver some of it when you win\n          this fight, don't you?\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n\n          (INCREDULOUS)\n          Is that what you really want?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          And allies. I'll have Coors out of\n          every bar in the Castro by the end\n          of the week. Deal?\n\n          ALLAN BAIRD\n          (nods, sincere)\n          Thank you Mr. Milk.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          15.\n          JUMP TO: Allan is on his way out. Harvey walks back behind\n          the counter to Scott.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          No more Coors beer. It's gotta come\n          out of every bar. Gay and straight.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          What's he giving you?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Nothing for me. That's a convert.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          A convert to what?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          The cause.\n\n          27A INT. VARIOUS SAN FRANCISCO BARS - PHOTO MONTAGE\n\n          A STILL PHOTO MONTAGE: Jim, Dick, Scott and Danny get bar\n          owners throughout San Francisco to unscrew their Coors taps,\n          throw out their Coors stock, put on \"Boycott Coors\" buttons\n          and tape up \"Dump Coors\" posters.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)\n          I got \"my people\" to get Coors out\n          of all the Gay Bars. 30 million\n          bottles worth in San Francisco\n          alone. Coors beer immediately fell\n          from number 1. They caved. One week\n          later, union man Allan Baird hired\n          the first ever openly gay union\n          boys to drive Teamsters trucks...\n          We weren't just a group of pansies\n          anymore. We had a neighborhood. We\n          had the unions. And for the first\n          time, we had a little bit of power.\n\n          27B INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT\n\n\n           HARVEY MILK\n          Maybe that was the day someone\n          first called me the \"Mayor\" of\n          Castro Street.\n          (a knowing grin)\n          Or perhaps I invented it myself.\n\n          28 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - ANOTHER NIGHT\n\n          Harvey, Jim & Dick, Scott, Danny and Dennis debate the merits\n          of working within \"the system\" versus dropping out. Everyone\n          is talking over each other...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          16.\n          A YOUNG GAY MAN runs into the store.\n\n          YOUNG GAY MAN\n          The fucking cops, man, they're up on\n          Castro Street! Toad Hall.\n          Harvey and the guys race out of the store.\n\n          29 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY\n\n          Harvey, Scott, Jim, Dick, Dennis run up the street toward one\n          of the Castro GAY BARS where POLICE ARE GETTING OUT OF SQUAD\n          CARS AND APPROACHING CUSTOMERS crowding around the entrance.\n\n          COP\n          Clear the sidewalk!\n          Some of the GAY MEN move out of the COPS' way but some of\n          them don't move FAST ENOUGH. The COPS start BEATING them.\n          Harvey, Scott and the OTHERS try to break into the crowd, to\n          get closer to the fight. To pull the cops off their friends.\n          Danny HANGS BACK, snapping PHOTOS of the event.\n          Scott SHOVES his way past the cops. A COP BRINGS HIS NIGHT\n          STICK down hard on SCOTT'S HEAD.\n\n          30 INT. HARVEY'S AND SCOTT'S BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT\n\n          Scott sits on the toilet. Harvey rinses blood from a white\n          washcloth and goes back to cleaning Scott's HEAD WOUND.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          ...if we had someone in the\n          government who saw things the way\n          we see them, the way the black\n          community has black leaders who\n          look out for their interests--\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          You're gonna run for Supervisor, is\n          that the idea?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n\n          (HALF-JOKING)\n          I could go right for mayor, but I\n          think I should work my way up to\n          it... You'll be my campaign\n          manager.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          17.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n\n          (SARCASTIC)\n          Because I have so much experience\n          in politics.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Politics is theater. It doesn't\n          matter if you win. You make a\n          statement. You say, \"I'm here, pay\n          attention to me.\"\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Harvey, you do that every time you\n          cross the street.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Coors looks like it might cave. The\n          union boys will owe me. Imagine if\n          we get their vote... It'll be fun!\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Fun?\n          Harvey starts kissing him all over.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          We'll make it a spectacle.\n\n          31 EXT. CASTRO STREET - DAY\n\n          Harvey walks down to Market St. with a box. He waves, shakes,\n          flirts with everyone. His warmest hello is from a gruff UNION\n          MAN. Behind Harvey, Scott pushes a loaded shopping cart.\n          Harvey sets his box down right beside a SFPD OFFICER. It\n          reads, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoap Box.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harvey steps onto it. A crowd forms.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          A week ago, Police officers came\n          into our area with covered up\n          badges and sent fourteen of our\n          people to the hospitals, and to\n          jail. The charges, \"Blocking a\n          Sidewalk.\"\n          Like a round girl at a boxing match, Scott parades around a\n          blown up PHOTO from his shopping cart: TWO SF COPS DRAGGING\n\n          GAY MEN INTO A PADDY WAGON.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          --Let us have our tax money go for\n          our protection and not our\n          persecution.

Harvey does a\n          well timed take. A few hoots from the eclectic crowd.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          My fellow degenerates, I would like\n          to announce my candidacy for San\n          Francisco City Supervisor!\n          Scott unfurls three hand made \"MILK FOR CITY SUPERVISOR\"\n          banners that lap over the sides of the shopping cart.\n\n          32 EXT.

Legalize pot, vote Milk.\n          Harvey is distracted. A young, long haired CLEVE JONES\n          passes. At 18, he looks 15. Harvey tries for his attention:\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          Hey, I like the way your pants\n          fit... Where are you from, kid?\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n\n          (LAUGHS)\n          Sorry old man, not interested.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Where's home?\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          Phoenix.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'm Harvey Milk.

Scott gives a laugh, but he looks\n          like he's about to lose it.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          If we lose this one, it'll be just\n          me and you again. I promise.\n          Scott nods. That's exactly what he needed to hear.\n\n          52 EXT.

A MAN jumps out of the car, and\n          the driver speeds around the block. Harvey turns a corner.\n          The man follows. Harvey picks up his pace. He searches his\n          pockets for a whistle, a weapon, and beelines it to his shop,\n          his nerves are failing him.\n          He gets to the doorway of his camera store, and runs face\n          first into: CLEVE JONES. He's not the feisty young kid he met\n          on the street earlier.

Harvey\n          continues marching.\n\n          61 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n          Harvey arrives, the crowd still hot. Cops beat their\n          nightsticks against their shields. Some jab protesters,\n          trying to incite a fight. Anger burns.\n          Harvey climbs the steps, his stage.

Rick looks uncomfortable around all these women.\n\n          ANNE KRONENBERG\n          I'm sorry. Are we distracting you,\n          Mr. Stokes? I'd hate to screw you\n          up on your big night.\n          Dick runs up looking for more fliers.

Anne walks\n          the long line, handing out new signs to arriving volunteers.\n          Harvey is handing out FLYERS. He is exhausted, his throat is\n          RAW. The campaign is nearly over.\n          A WEIRD MOMENT: A BOY walks up to Harvey and hands him a\n          flier. ALL SOUND GOES DEAD ON THE SOUNDTRACK as HARVEY'S EYES\n          lock into the BOY'S EYES.\n          Harvey reads the FLIER: \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnite and Fight for Dan White.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n          Harvey looks back to pat the BOY'S head, but he's gone. He\n          looks to the sidewalk for the kid... a parent... nothing...\n\n          71 INT. CASTRO CAMERA - NIGHT\n\n          Harvey is still looking at the flier. Anne is leaving with a\n          stack of SF Chronicles. Cleve comes in, pulls one off her\n          stack, and looks for \"the article.\"\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          They've accused me of many things,\n          but never as blatant a lie as this.\n\n          ANNE KRONENBERG\n          First ever newspaper endorsement.\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          (reading the article)\n          They endorsed you for being a good\n          businessman?

Harvey sits alone\n          watching the bargoers return home through his front window. A\n          bitter-sweetness lingers. A couple waves, one shouts out:\n\n          GAY MAN\n          Gonna win this time, Milk?\n          They walk on, not waiting for an answer.\n          Then, a drunk, cute, Latino, JACK LIRA, 25, stops. He stares\n          in at the political ads in the window. Harvey watches him\n          sway drunk out of his mind, waiting for him to fall. The two\n          make eye contact. Harvey smiles. Jack tries to. Harvey picks\n          up a folding chair and walks it out to him.\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          (re: poster in the window)\n          You're more handsome in the\n          posters.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Thank you.

Do you think I'm\n          more like a Palomino or a Stallion?\n          Jack smiles, out of his mind. Then he sits/falls down into\n          the chair, and slides off. Harvey stands above the passed out\n          young man. A newcomer. A wounded bird. Perfect.\n\n          72 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\n\n          Completely nude, Jack plays a tantalizing game of seduction,\n          allowing Harvey to hold him, then wriggling away... Dancing\n          against Harvey then BITING his shoulder... LYING on the bed,\n          then ROLLING away when Harvey tries to hold him...\n          No TALK. No POLITICS. Just SEX.

He's been up\n          all night.\n\n          DAN WHITE (ON TV)\n          I've assured Harvey here that my\n          brochure's comments about \"social\n          deviants\" referred more to junkies\n          than to his people. See, I'm about\n          to have my first child. I have to\n          make sure this city remains a\n          decent place to raise him.\n\n          80 INT.

CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n\n          Harvey walks in. Michael and Jim are in a strategy session.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          The first order of business that\n          will come out of this office is a\n          city wide Gay Rights Ordinance.\n          Just like the one Anita shot down\n          in Dade County. What do you think,\n          Lotus Blossom?\n\n          MICHAEL WONG\n          I think it's good. Not great.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Then make it brilliant. I want\n          Anita's attention here. In San\n          Francisco. I want her to bring her\n          fight to US... This Bill needs a\n          unanimous vote. We need headlines.\n\n          JIM RIVALDO\n          Dan White won't vote for this.\n          Harvey puts his fingers to his lips and points down the hall,\n          indicating Dan is down there. Harvey whispers:\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Dan's fine. He's just uneducated.\n          We can teach him.\n          Dan pops his head into Harvey's office.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Harvey, committee meets at 9:30.\n          Oh, hi Michael, Jim.\n          (to Harvey)\n          Hey, did you get the invitation to\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          52.\n\n          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)\n          my son's christening?

THE CASTRO - TWILIGHT\n\n          The neighborhood is booming. Storefronts and sidewalks\n          filled. This is not the rundown Castro that Harvey moved\n          into 3 years ago.\n          Harvey heads home, greeted by his PROUD CONSTITUENTS.\n          He stops at the CAMERA SHOP when he notices a BROKEN WINDOW\n          near the side entrance to his apartment.\n\n          85 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - TWILIGHT\n\n          Harvey RUSHES UP THE STAIRS into his apartment and finds:\n          JACK LIRA - Lighting a candle on the table which has been set\n          for a lovely, romantic dinner.\n\n          HARVEY\n          Jack?\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          Welcome home, Harvey! I hope you're\n          hungry.

So I came in\n          this way. Your friends aren't very\n          nice to me.\n\n          HARVEY\n          (avoiding the fight)\n          I have a Town Hall meeting tonight,\n          Jack.\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          You work too hard.

I have an\n          invitation to a party tomorrow.\n          Lots of rich people, politicians.\n          We could get all dressed up...\n          Jack turns up the music, takes Harvey's hands and guides him\n          through a simple dance.\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          So I could be the first lady?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Uh-huh.\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          I watched TV here today. All day. I\n          saw All My Children. They killed\n          Margo. I knew it was going to\n          happen. They try and trick you but\n          it never works.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (enjoying this)\n          You always see it coming?\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          What? Killing the blonde? Every\n          time. I'm good with that.\n          (gets slow, sensual)\n          I think now the old lady is going\n          to have an affair. Then she'll get\n          killed or married. Always one or\n          the other. Dead or married.\n          Jack starts dancing with Harvey again. It's sweet, intimate.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          54.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          If I make you a key, you won't\n          break my windows again, right?\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          That's right.\n          The dance lesson is a lovely distraction. Harvey won't be\n          going back to work tonight.\n\n          86 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY\n\n          Harvey watches water pour over an INFANT BOY. He tries hard\n          to feel comfortable, but he's the only Jew, and likely the\n          only gay man at Dan's child's baptism.\n          Dan looks to Harvey, the proud father. Harvey waves.\n\n          87 INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER\n\n          Harvey and Dan have pulled themselves away.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'm proposing a citywide ordinance.\n          It ensures that a person who\n          already has a job can't be fired\n          for their orientation.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          I'm not sure my constituents would\n          favor that.\n          Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Is anyone else here from the Board?\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          You're the only one who showed up I\n          think.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Were you christened here?\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Yes. Right here. Same Parish. My\n          grandma immigrated here when this\n          was an Irish Catholic city. The\n          City of St. Francis... A lot's\n          changed here since then.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          You're more like one of us now...\n          an outsider.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          55.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          You're not like most homosexuals,\n          are you, Harvey?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Do you know a lot of \"homosexuals?\"\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          (smiles, then)\n          Say, where do you stand on the\n          Psychiatric Center the City's been\n          pushing into my district?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Well, I'd have to study it...\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Getting it out of my district was a\n          key piece of my platform. It only\n          attracts arsonist, rapists, all\n          that, you know.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Sure, sure. A campaign promise.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          A big one.\n\n          (QUIET)\n          What do you say we watch out for each\n          other's interests? I'd like that.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'd like that, too, Dan.\n          Mary Ann White approaches with their child. It's awkward, as\n          if she's walked in on something intimate.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          I'm sorry. Slipped into some shop\n          talk.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          The Gay Rights Ordinance.

She\n          cracks a polite smile. They're from very different worlds.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          56.\n\n          88 INT.

But\n          Anita Bryant and her right wing\n          Christian fundamentalists were\n          creating and exploiting and fanning\n          a backlash. Now she had referenda\n          to repeal all of these gay rights\n          ordinances. While we were preparing\n          for the battle against Briggs and\n          Prop Six, Anita Bryant was taking\n          her show on the road... sweeping\n          the country.

He's enrolling\n          in classes on Monday.\n          Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey's jacket.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          I remember when your birthdays were\n          a bit less... lavish. More\n          intimate.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Who invited you? Anne?\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          My boyfriend got an invitation. I\n          was his \"plus one.\"\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Congratulations. It was a tough\n          ticket to get.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Congratulations to you. Looks like\n          you're part of the Machine now.\n          (Harvey looks away, toward Jack)\n          You can do better.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          When I come home to Jack, I don't\n          have to talk politics or talk\n          intelligently. Or even talk.\n\n          (SELF-DEPRECATING)\n          And where's an old man like me\n          going to get such a good looking\n          young man, right?\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          You're not so old. You look\n          handsome... Happy 48th. Looks like\n          you're gonna make it to fifty after-\n          all, Mr. Milk.\n          Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS.\n\n          109 INT. A SAN FRANCISCO HALL - LATER THAT NIGHT\n\n          Harvey, still wearing cream pie remnants on his jacket, waits\n          for Jack to come out of the rest room. Harvey's one of the\n          last guests to leave. WAITERS are clearing tables.\n\n          HARVEY'S POV DOWN A DIMLY LIT CORRIDOR: A MALE FIGURE\n          APPROACHES, footsteps ECHOING on the marble floor.

He approaches Harvey\n          with a bottle of Chivas.\n          Dan is SUPER-FRIENDLY, as if nothing unpleasant has ever\n          happened between them.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Sorry I missed the party, Harv...\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          No problem, Dan. Good to see you.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Dog poop?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Yeah.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          It's good! It's a good one.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Thanks. But it's a real problem.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Oh, yeah. I mean, God knows how many\n          problems it causes. All kinds of\n          diseases, birth defects probably, I\n          mean, stuff you can't even...\n          (drifting off, drunkenly)\n          Hey, I got you a little something.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          You didn't have to--\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          (at the same time)\n          You didn't have to--\n\n          (LAUGHING)\n          Why do people always say that?\n          \"You didn't have to?\" I mean, of\n          course, right? But, that's what\n          they always say. They always say\n          things like that...\n          Dan's attempts to be witty and erudite (like Harvey) only\n          leave him confused and tongue tied.\n          Harvey HAS NO IDEA why Dan is here.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Are you okay, Dan?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          77.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          Oh, what? Yeah, sure. Harvey, I\n          just... I just want to say...\n          Happy Birthday.\n          Dan PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND HARVEY for a sort-of macho but\n          really weird birthday hug. Harvey stiffens, it's such a\n          peculiar moment. Dan steps back, looks him over.\n\n          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)\n          I've really learned a lot from\n          watching you, Harvey.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I doubt that.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          No, I have. You gotta get out\n          there. Get noticed. That's how it\n          works. But, you have an issue.\n          That's your advantage.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          It's more than an issue, Dan.\n          (a beat, one last try to\n          get through to him)\n          Dan. I've had four relationships in\n          my life. Three of those four tried\n          to kill themselves. I know it was\n          my fault they did it. I told them\n          to stay quiet. To hide. Most of my\n          life I've been closeted. That's\n          what living this life is like for\n          most of us. The way things are...\n          This isn't just about our jobs, or\n          any issue, it's our lives we're\n          fighting for.\n          Jack emerges from the bathroom, barely together and leans on\n          Harvey. Dan steps back from Harvey and Jack, his moment\n          alone stolen away.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          I've learned a lot from you,\n          Harvey. I'm going to get my picture\n          in the papers, too. You'll see.\n          I've got my own issue. That's\n          right. Dan White's Got An Issue!\n\n          110 EXT.

We wouldn't allow\n          it for any other parade in San\n          Francisco, and it should not be\n          allowed for the gay parade.\n\n          112 EXT.

I want to recruit\n          you for the fight to preserve your\n          democracy. Brothers and sisters, you\n          must come out. Come out to your\n          parents. I know that it is hard and\n          will hurt them but think about how\n          they will hurt you in the voting\n          booth! Come out to your friends, if\n          they indeed are your friends. Come\n          out to your neighbors, to your\n          fellow workers. Once and for all,\n          break down the myths, destroy the\n          lies and distortions. For your sake.\n          For their sake. For the sake of the\n          youngsters who are becoming scared\n          by the votes from Dade to Eugene. On\n          the Statue of Liberty it says \"Give\n          me your tired, your poor, your\n          huddled masses yearning to be free.\"\n          In the Declaration of Independence\n          it is written \"All men are created\n          equal and are endowed with certain\n          inalienable rights.\" For Mr. Briggs\n          and Mrs. Bryant and all the bigots\n          out there, no matter how hard you\n          try, you cannot erase those words\n          from the Declaration of\n          Independence. No matter how hard you\n          try, you cannot chip those words\n          from off the base of the Statue of\n          Liberty. That is what America is.\n          Love it or leave it.\n          Wild applause. He scans the crowd as he steps off stage. A\n          bit surprised to still be alive. Cleve grabs him.\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          The Mayor says Briggs is on his way\n          here. He could intercept him for\n          us. We could get him face to face.\n          He couldn't ignore us anymore.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Get the press.\n\n          113 INT. LIMOUSINE / 5 BLOCKS FROM THE FREEDOM DAY PARADE - SAME\n\n          John Briggs rides in a limo watching the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreaks\" outside. As\n          he nears the Parade Stages his POLICE ESCORTS take an\n          unplanned turn.

WAREHOUSE ON THE PIER - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          The limo pulls in. Briggs cautiously steps out. Greeting him\n          are Moscone, the POLICE CHIEF, 25 SFPD officers, a gaggle of\n          press, and Harvey Milk.\n          It's a showdown... HIGH NOON.\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          I have a right to be here, Mr. Mayor.\n\n          MAYOR MOSCONE\n          I'm afraid it's not in the interest\n          of your safety, or my public's\n          safety to let you into that parade\n          grounds.\n          Finally face to face, Harvey extends his hand. Its a show for\n          the FLASHING CAMERAS. Briggs is clearly uncomfortable.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Hi, I'm Harvey Milk. It's quite an\n          honor to meet you, Mr. Briggs.\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          I'm aware. Sad you're too afraid to\n          fight this out in public, Mr. Milk.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          No sir. I would love to have a\n          public debate. I'm very interested\n          in the details of your argument.\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          You know the details. As do the\n          people. Look at the votes across this\n          nation. The \"public\" is with me.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Yes sir, today they are. But with my\n          City's Mayor and the San Francisco\n          press as my witnesses, I'm\n          challenging you to a public debate.\n          John nods, stiff. He can no longer avoid Harvey Milk. He gets\n          back in his limo.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          81.\n\n          INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115\n\n          Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward. We\n          hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Senator, as a Christian it's\n          interesting that you don't seem to\n          understand what Christ was about.\n          He was about accepting people and\n          giving love, not carrying a Bible\n          in one hand and hatred in the\n          other...\n          (cheers from the audience)\n          ...Now all the gay myths have been\n          shattered, all the fears, all the--\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          Not in my mind they haven't--\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          That's it. In your mind they\n          haven't, and I'm wondering why--\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          Mr. Milk, we don't allow people who\n          believe in practicing bestiality to\n          teach our children, and the reason\n          we don't is because it is illegal.\n          But it's not illegal to be a\n          homosexual in California.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          And your law goes even further. Any\n          school employee who even supports a\n          gay person will be fired--\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          True. But, gay people don't have\n          children of their own. If they\n          don't recruit our children, they'd\n          all die away. That's why they want\n          to be teachers, to encourage our\n          children to join them.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (ON TV)\n          How do you teach homosexuality?\n          Like French? I was born of\n          heterosexual parents, I was taught\n          by heterosexual teachers in a\n          fiercely heterosexual society. So\n          then why am I homosexual? And no\n          offense meant, but if it were true\n          that children mimicked their\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          82.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (ON TV) (CONT'D)\n          teachers, you'd sure have a helluva\n          lot more nuns running around.\n          The audience eats it up.

We didn't think\n          there was any chance we could beat\n          it. What we hoped to do was to\n          organize to the point that when we\n          did lose, there would be a\n          revolt... That all hell would break\n          lose.\n\n          117 INT.

It misses, CRASHING\n          THROUGH THE WINDOW onto the street below.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          84.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I'll get a broom.\n          Harvey goes. Jack collapses into a chair.\n\n          119 INT. AUDITORIUM IN ORANGE COUNTY - NIGHT\n\n          TV CAMERAS ROLL. They've gotten their ORANGE COUNTY DEBATE!\n          BRIGGS'S SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State\n          Senator. Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience.\n          Harvey lifts a Briggs flier.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          If in your statements here you say\n          that child molestation is not an\n          issue, why do you put out literature\n          that hammers it home, why do you play\n          on that myth and fear?\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          Same thing with VD Harvey, we put\n          out publications about VD so you\n          can avoid it.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (with a grin)\n          But you've even admitted that\n          there's more molestation in the\n          heterosexual group! So why not get\n          rid of the heterosexual teachers?\n          Boos from the conservative audience.\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          We are not talking about homos...\n          child molestation, the fact is, at\n          least 95 percent of the people are\n          heterosexual. If we took\n          heterosexuals out AND homosexuals\n          out, you know what--\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS (CONT'D) HARVEY MILK\n          --we'd have no teachers We'd have no teachers--\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          --No child molestation... So you're\n          saying the percentage of population\n          is equal to the percentage of child\n          molestation?\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          (getting more lost)\n          No, no, I'm not saying that at all--\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          85.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          That's what you just said.\n\n          JOHN BRIGGS\n          No. I'm saying that we cannot\n          prevent child molestation so let's\n          cut our odds down and take out the\n          homosexual group and keep in the\n          heterosexual group--\n          Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument. Briggs\n          looks down to his notes, lost. Harvey takes the opportunity\n          to rip into the State Senator:\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (directly to Briggs)\n          --Sir, in your own drive for\n          personal power, how many careers\n          are you willing to see destroyed?\n          How many lives will you destroy in\n          your lust for power, and when will\n          you stop?\n          The crowd boos, rails. This isn't San Francisco, it's Orange\n          County. In the audience, Dick Pabich sweats, taken aback by\n          the level of hatred. Harvey tries to maintain his composure.\n\n          120 EXT. CASTRO STREET - NIGHT\n\n          Harvey heads home from work. He starts into his store.\n          He sees JACK LIRA'S SHADOW through the curtains upstairs, and\n          turns instead to the cafe next door.\n\n          121 INT. CASTRO CAFE - NIGHT\n\n          Harvey sits down at the bar. The WAITER pours a coffee for\n          him. Harvey looks up to the TV.\n          HARVEY'S POV: DAN WHITE ON TV talking to a news reporter. It\n          feels as if Dan is talking directly to Harvey.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          All I'm really saying is, if we\n          don't protect ourselves with this\n          kind of legislation, a transvestite\n          can show up at a public school with\n          all the qualifications for teaching\n          and they can't refuse to hire him.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          86.\n\n          122 INT. CITY HALL / HARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n          Harvey rushes from a packed session in the Supervisors'\n          Chambers to his office. Anne is behind him. He picks up the\n          phone. It seems urgent.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Hey Jack, what's wrong?\n\n          123 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT\n\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          Nothing. I just want to know when\n          you'll be home.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          You just had them pull me out of my\n          big vote on the dog shit ordinance.\n          Did you do this on purpose, Jack?\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          It's poop, Harvey. Aren't I more\n          important than poop?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Yes, but... I don't know when I'll\n          be home. Maybe 6. 6:15.\n\n          JACK LIRA\n          Fine. 6:15.\n          Harvey hangs up. His patience is slipping. He looks up in\n          time to see Dan heading down the hall with his briefcase.\n\n          124 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS HALLWAY - DAY\n\n          Harvey catches up to Dan who is on his way out.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Dan? How's the baby?\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          You didn't bring up Supervisor pay\n          raises. In fact, I heard you plan\n          to publicly oppose them.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I heard you planned to vote against\n          them too, Dan. Were you trying to\n          set me up?\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          (parrotting Harvey\n\n          EARLIER)\n\n          (MORE)\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          87.\n\n          DAN WHITE (CONT'D)\n          It's not a good time for me to\n          bring it up. Politically.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Dan, there's a vote to approve the\n          police desegregation settlement,\n          give me that and I'll consider\n          backing pay raises.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          (suddenly very dark)\n          I don't trade votes... unlike you,\n          the way I was raised, we believe in\n          right and wrong. Moral and immoral.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Black skin and White in your police\n          department?\n          (Dan steams)\n          Dan, even Ronald Reagan's come out\n          against Proposition Six. You're\n          looking more and more out of touch.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          If I come out against Prop Six,\n          it's only for the invasion of\n          State's rights issue.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (smiles, trying to lighten)\n          And the potential witch hunts\n          against you \"straight people,\"\n          right?\n          Dan tries hard to come up with a cogent response. He can't.\n          His behavior is alarming. He sets down his briefcase.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          You underestimate me, Milk. You're\n          very, very wrong about me.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I don't know what you mean.\n          A moment. Dan is on the verge of tears, hot angry tears.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          What is it, Dan? You can tell me.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          You don't... You can't humiliate\n          me. And you will not demean me.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          88.\n          Anne appears down the hall. Dan has more on his mind, but the\n          moment has passed. He picks up his briefcase and walks out of\n          the building. Off Harvey, concerned.\n\n          125 EXT. CITY HALL - LATER\n\n          Harvey walks home. A PASSERBY shouts:\n\n          PASSERBY\n          You're the asshole that just passed\n          that dog shit thing aren't you? What\n          the hell do you have against dogs?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (with his trademark charm)\n          Sir, blind people can't see \"shit.\"\n          What the heck do you have against\n          blind people?\n          The young folks surrounding the PASSERBY laugh and hoot at\n          Harvey's joke. Even the harassing PASSERBY can't help but\n          crack a grin. Harvey beams.\n\n          126 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER\n\n          Opening the door, Harvey finds a trail of voter registration\n          cards, anti-Briggs literature, and Coors beer cans. Pushing\n          through his fear, he carefully follows the cans and flyers up\n          the stairs and through his apartment.\n          Odd notes are taped to the walls. They all lead to a black\n          velvet curtain with a note attached: \"YOU'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE\n\n          CIRCUS, HARVEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY LAST ACT?\"\n          Harvey pulls back the curtain to find Jack's body, cold and\n          discolored, hanging from a beam by a noose.\n          HARVEY CAN'T MOVE. He is mesmerized... horrified.\n          He grabs a knife and frantically tries cutting Jack down. He\n          cuts through the rope and FALLS TO THE FLOOR with the HEAVY\n\n          BODY.\n\n          127 INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - LATER\n\n          Scott arrives. Sitting very still, Harvey is being consoled\n          by Cleve and Anne. Tears in his eyes, Harvey won't look up.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          Harvey. Look at me. Look at me. You\n          did everything you could.\n\n          HARVEY\n          No, I didn't. Not everything...\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          89.\n\n          SCOTT SMITH\n          What else could you have done?\n\n          HARVEY\n          I could have come home at six\n          o'clock, not six-fifteen.\n          Scott puts his arm around Harvey. Harvey buries his head.\n          Anne helps Cleve take down Jack's many hidden notes. Cleve\n          quietly reads a prominently placed one:\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          \"Beware. The ides. Of November.\"\n\n          127A INT. FLASH FORWARD - HARVEY'S KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT\n\n          Into the recorder as if re-living the event over again...\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Jack was gone. I didn't have time\n          to mourn... There was no choice but\n          to keep on... to keep fighting.\n\n          128 INT. BARNUM AND BAILEY CIRCUS / MAKE UP ROOM / S.F. - DAY\n\n          Harvey sits in a make-up chair. A MAKE-UP artist is painting\n          him up to look like a clown. Several other CITY OFFICIALS are\n          in chairs beyond him. Harvey turns to the make-up artist.\n          With sincere enthusiasm:\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Thank you for this great honor. But\n          do you think once the magazine is\n          done snapping pictures, maybe I\n          could keep the suit for a while?\n\n          129 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY\n\n          Still made up from head to toe as a clown, Harvey walks the\n          streets of San Francisco. He waves, smiles, poses for photos\n          with tourists. It's a rare moment of grace. He jumps on a\n          trolley headed toward Castro. He instantly captures the\n          imagination of a small GIRL wearing a knit hat.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (re: their hats)\n          Would you like to trade with me?\n\n          GIRL\n          No. What the heck are you?\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Oh, me? I'm an elected official. I\n          run this city.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          90.\n          He makes a show of it. She smiles. He hands her the flower\n          he's been holding onto all afternoon.\n\n          130 INT. \"NO ON SIX\" CENTER / MARKET STREET - NIGHT\n\n          THIS IS THE MOMENT. Harvey watches aides on the phones comb\n          districts for voting results. Jim fills up a map on the wall.\n\n          DICK PABICH\n          San Bernadino is coming in. Not\n          good.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Of course not. How not good?\n\n          MICHAEL WONG\n          60% for Briggs. Same in Fresno.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Dear God, little Lotus Blossom.\n          Harvey is stunned. Other districts follow with similar\n          results. They go up in red on the map.\n\n          JIM RIVALDO\n          Imperial is 69% \"for\" so far.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Put it up on the board.\n          Harvey tries to stomach this major defeat, loss after loss.\n          He starts reflexively tying his tie in a knot. Cleve comes up\n          to Harvey, concerned.\n\n          HARVEY MILK (CONT'D)\n          The whole world is watching this.\n          This is San Francisco we're about\n          to lose. Are you ready?\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          I can have 15,000 people in an\n          hour. But there's gonna be riots if\n          this thing passes.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (darkens, pointed)\n          There goddamn better be.\n\n          CLEVE JONES\n          (stops, a beat, then:)\n          What are you telling me?\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          91.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I can't say it because I'm a public\n          official, but for God's sake, if\n          this thing passes, fight back.\n          Cleve is stunned, holding the weight of Harvey's words.\n          Harvey's focus is interrupted when Anne brings him the phone.\n\n          ANNE KRONENBERG\n          Don Amador down in LA.\n\n          HARVEY\n          (reluctantly answers)\n          Kind of a bad time, Don.\n\n          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)\n          No sir, this is Paul. Don just gave\n          me the phone.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Paul who?\n\n          YOUNG TEEN (V.O.)\n          You talked to me on the phone a\n          year or so ago. I'm from\n          Minnesota... I'm in a wheelchair.\n          REVEAL: The boy in his wheelchair on the other end.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          (a beat to take it in, then:)\n          I thought you were a goner, Paul.\n\n          YOUNG TEEN\n          I'm sorry. I should have called.\n          When I read in the paper that you\n          won the Supervisor seat, I got a\n          friend to put me on a bus to LA.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Who did you know in Los Angeles?\n\n          YOUNG TEEN\n          Nobody. That's the uh... I just\n          didn't want to die anymore, sir.\n          (Harvey's at a loss for words)\n          I met your friend Don down here. I\n          turned 18. I voted today against\n          Prop Six... Thank you, Mr. Milk.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          No. You did this all by yourself.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          92.\n\n          YOUNG TEEN\n          I don't think I'd be alive right now\n          without you, sir. You were right\n          about LA. It's like gay Disney\n          World.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Then you have to see San Francisco!\n\n          YOUNG TEEN\n          Okay. I will. Don wanted me to\n          um... congratulate you on what he\n          says looks like a big win for us\n          tonight. Congratulations Mr. Milk.\n          Harvey turns back to the map. Jim Rivaldo is now coloring in\n          LA county with green. On the other end of the phone, Harvey's\n          friend in LA, Don Amador, is back on the line.\n\n          DON AMADOR (V.O.)\n          It looks like we've taken LA\n          County, Harvey. By 65%. It's huge.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          I gotta go, Don. Thank you.\n          (frantic, to the room)\n          LA by 65% put it up! Put it up!\n          The tone in the room is changing. Jim storms up.\n\n          JIM RIVALDO\n          The polls were off. Briggs is going\n          down by more than 2 to 1. The only\n          district where it's leading in San\n          Francisco is Dan White's.\n          Harvey takes a moment to absorb the map. Anne, Dick & Jim,\n          all the volunteers. What this apparent win means to him, to\n          his people. To Cleve:\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Well crap Cleve, now what are we\n          going to do tonight?!\n          (re: a giant, jock strap\n          wearing, Lady Liberty)\n          Cover up Lady Liberty. The cameras\n          will be coming our way.\n\n          131 INT. \"NO ON SIX\" CENTER / MARKET STREET - LATER\n\n          TV cameras roll. Lady liberty is covered with a \"No on Six\"\n          poster. A brass band marches dramatically into the hall.\n          Balloons fall. Harvey MOUNTS the stage to INCREDIBLE CHEERS.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          93.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          To the gay community all over this\n          state... my message to you is... so\n          far a lot of people joined us and\n          rejected Proposition Six, and now we\n          owe them something...

There are nods, hellos if not outright deference from\n          most passersby. His newfound political muscle is evident.\n          He comes face to face with Dan White.\n\n          HARVEY MILK\n          Morning, Dan.\n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          \n\n          95.\n\n          DAN WHITE\n          I just resigned.
