He lets it ring and\n          ring. Finally, a voice picks up on the other line.\n\n<b>          SCOTT SMITH\n</b>          Hello?\n          REVEAL: Scott, half asleep.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Sorry to wake you up.\n\n<b>          SCOTT SMITH\n</b>          What's wrong?\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          I went to the opera tonight.

The crowd\n          went wild. It was like I was young\n          again, seeing my first live opera...\n\n<b>          SCOTT SMITH\n</b>          If you go to the opera again, you\n          should call me.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Really?\n          Scott gets out of bed, considers his words.

I'd go with you.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          I'd like that.\n          Harvey is quiet, a rare moment of reflection. An unexpected\n          tear rolls down his cheek.\n\n<b>          SCOTT SMITH\n</b>          Harvey?\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Look out the window, the sun's\n          coming up.\n\n<b>          SCOTT SMITH\n</b>          It's late.

DAN WHITE'S HOME / LIVING ROOM - MORNING\n</b>\n          The sun rising in his own living room, Dan White has been up\n          all night, too. The coffee table is covered with coke cans\n          and junk food wrappers.\n\n<b>          145 INT. CITY HALL - DAY\n</b>\n          Waiting for a MAN inside to turn away, Dan sneaks in through\n          a side window at City Hall. The man calls after him:\n\n<b>          MAN\n</b>          Hey, wait a minute, Mr.--\n\n<b>          DAN WHITE\n</b>          My aide was supposed to come down\n          here and let me in the side door,\n          but she never showed up.\n\n<b>          MAN\n</b>          And you are?\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          100.\n</b>\n<b>          DAN WHITE\n</b>          I'm Dan White.

CITY HALL / METAL DETECTORS - SAME\n</b>\n          Harvey walks through City Hall's METAL DETECTORS. He picks up\n          his keys from the dish and heads up the grand staircase. Like\n          ships in the night, Harvey just misses Dan exiting the\n          elevator. Dan heads into Mayor Moscone's office.\n\n<b>          147 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' CHAMBERS - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n          With Dianne, Harvey is thrilled, rubbing it in.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Who's it gonna be? Is he replacing\n          Dan with that God Damned liberal\n          lefty Don Horanzy? That'll really\n          shake up the Board, huh?\n\n<b>          DIANNE FEINSTEIN\n</b>          All I know is that we're getting a\n          new Supervisor today. If Dan shows\n          up, just avoid him. We don't need\n          a scene today, right Harvey?\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          (grins ear to ear)\n          Heaven forbid, Dianne.\n\n<b>          148 INT.

CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME\n</b>\n          Moscone leads Dan White to the bar beside his office. Dan is\n          enraged. Moscone lights a cigarette.\n\n<b>          DAN WHITE\n</b>          You can't take this away from me!\n          Moscone has his back turned, pouring them cocktails.\n\n<b>          MAYOR MOSCONE\n</b>          The issue is what's fair, for the\n          people of your district.

CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S WAITING ROOM - SAME\n</b>\n          Moscone's Secretary, and a WAITING MAN note the THREE DULL\n          THUDS, not so different than a backfire. The secretary looks\n          out the window, concerned. The waiting man checks his watch.\n\n<b>          151 INT. CITY HALL / MAYOR MOSCONE'S OFFICE - SAME\n</b>\n          Still gripped in his hand, Moscone's cigarette burns a hole\n          in his tie.\n\n<b>          152 INT. CITY HALL / SUPERVISORS' OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER\n</b>\n          Dan walks past Dick Pabich, past Dianne's office. Harvey's\n          voice can be heard down the hall. He sounds up-beat,\n\n<b>          OPTIMISTIC:\n</b>\n<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.)\n</b>          This time next year we're marching\n          on Washington D.C.

I'm going to\n          deposit this. I'll be back in 20\n          minutes.\n          Dan arrives at Harvey's office door. Harvey is with a FRIEND,\n          preparing to leave, surprised to see Dan in his doorway.\n\n<b>          DAN WHITE\n</b>          Say, Harve, can I see you for a\n          minute?\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Sure.\n          Dan walks Harvey down the hall to his old office.\n\n<b>          153 INT. CITY HALL / DAN WHITE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n          Harvey walks in first. Dan stays between Harvey and the door.\n          Dan closes it. Harvey smiles, sensing something is off.\n          Dan draws his revolver. Harvey raises his hand. Dan Fires.\n          The bullet rips through Harvey's hand and down his arm.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK\n</b>          Oh no... N--\n          Dan Fires again, silencing Harvey's cry for help.\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          102.\n</b>          Harvey turns away. Another bullet rips into his chest, and he\n          falls to his knees, now facing the window. He staggers toward\n          it. The moment is extended as we see Harvey's POV of the\n          Opera House outside the window, and the Castro beyond it.\n          HOLD ON HARVEY, gazing out at his beloved city.\n          Dan puts his revolver to the back of Harvey's head. HE FIRES.\n          And just like that, Harvey falls.\n\n<b>          HARVEY MILK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n</b>          Last week I got a phone call--\n\n<b>          156 INT.
