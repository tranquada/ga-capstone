Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted\n          container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his\n          saddles bags --\n          -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy\n          iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia.\n          Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away --\n          -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He\n          jams the front brake on at the last possible moment --\n           The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three-\n          sixty up into the car --\n\n<b>          INSIDE THE CAR\n</b>          -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS\n          his exhilaration.

Breaking into TONS OF PLUNGING DEBRIS\n          that CRASH SPECTACULARLY onto the highway far below.\n\n<b>          ON GHOST BLAZE AND RAIN,\n</b>           clutching precariously to a muddy hillside. Ghost Blaze\n          looks up, SEES --\n\n<b>          DAWN APPROACHING,\n</b>           first light bleeding in over the distant mountains.\n\n<b>          EXT. HIGHWAY - MISSION RUINS - JUST BEFORE DAWN\n</b>\n           Ghost Blaze strides over the smoking ruins. Finds what he\n          was looking for --\n\n<b>          CARRIGAN,\n</b>          back to human, hopelessly trapped deep in the wreckage. He's\n          barely alive, just a face in the rubble. Carrigan blinks.\n\n<b>                         CARRIGAN\n</b>          (a ragged whisper)\n          who -- the fuck -- are you, anyway?\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          114.\n</b>\n<b>                         CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>                         GHOST BLAZE\n</b>          Vengeance.\n          And Ghost Blaze raises his hand, HELLFIRE trickling down the\n          length of his arm, swirling around his hand like a building\n          static charge even as --\n\n<b>                         CARRIGAN\n</b>          (terrified, yet defiant)\n          Do it, fucker -- dQ it.\n\n<b>                         RAIN\n</b>          appears on a ridge just before them, eyes locking onto him.\n          It's now or never.\n          Ghost Blaze hesitates, hesitates -- then abruptly reins the\n          flame back in. Metabolizes the fury. Pushes it down deep\n          through sheer, agony-inducing willpower. Ghost Blaze\n          SCREAMS, struggles --\n          -- and forces the Demon away,\n          Now he's just Blaze, weak with exertion, but triumphant for\n          the first time in years. He turns away and we --\n\n<b>                         CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>          EXT_ MISSION GROUNDS - DAWN\n</b>           -- Blaze and Rain walking, working their way across the\n           scorched grounds. Rain kicks at a carbonized jaw-beast\n          skull. It rolls, SMASHES against a tree, crumbles to dust.\n           Blaze looks up just then, HEARS the sound of ---\n\n<b>                         STARKE'S CADILLAC\n</b>           It slows to a stop at the end of the drive, ENGINE RUMBLING.\n           Dusty and bug-begrimed from its cross-country journey.\n           Blaze braces himself. A silent inhalation of breath. Rain\n          stares, paralyzed by fear --\n          The driver's door opens. A hulking silhouette steps out.\n          The Beast, backlit by the fiery dawn which is just breaking\n          over the horizon. Sunlight FLARES outward, briefly blinding\n          us. And when it subsides --\n\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          is standing there. Human. Windblown. He raises a hand,\n          shielding his gaze from the light. Steps cowards them --\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          115.\n</b>\n<b>                         CONTINUED:\n</b>          Blaze moves in front of Rain, blocking Starke's path.\n          They stand there in silence. And Starke smiles, eyes alight\n          with mischief.\n\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          Looks like we've come to the end of the\n          road, haven't we?\n\n<b>                         BLAZE\n</b>          Guess so.\n          After a long beat:\n\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          Give me the girl and I'll lift the curse.\n          Blaze looks down at Rain. This was all he ever wanted. The\n          only thing that has kept him going all these years. He\n          reaches into his jacket, retrieving a crumpled pack of\n          cigarettes. Plucks one out --\n\n<b>                         BLAZE\n</b>          She's all yours, Starke --\n          -- and lights it without a match, somehow conjuring the flame\n          from within himself. He takes a long drag. In the pits of\n          his eyes, something glows there -- a kind of lambent\n          darkness.\n\n<b>                         BLAZE (CONT'D)\n</b>          -- but you'll have to go through me if\n          you want her.\n          Starke stares into Blaze's eyes. Doesn't like what he SEES.\n\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          Don't be a fool, Blaze. I'm offering you\n          your life back.\n\n<b>                         BLAZE\n</b>          That's not a life. And least now one I'm\n          interested in living.\n\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          You think you can control it. You can't.\n\n<b>                         BLAZE\n</b>          Guess I'm willing to take my chances.\n          Starke nods, accepting defeat. For now. He looks down at\n          Rain, a bitter smile creeping across his face --\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          116.\n</b>\n<b>                         CONTINUED: (2)\n</b>\n<b>                         STARKE\n</b>          You have your mother's eyes.\n          -- and walks away.\n          Blaze and Rain watch him retreat. Presently, a coyote slips\n          from shadows, joining him on the road. It--lopes along beside\n          him. We watch them disappear over a rise. Then they're\n          gone.\n          Beat. Rain studies Blaze, reaches for his hand.\n\n<b>                         RAIN\n</b>          He'll be back.\n\n<b>                         BLAZE\n</b>          Yeah.\n\n<b>          BACK AMONGST THE SMOKING RUINS\n</b>          We pass broken concrete, smouldering timber, a rock snake\n          constricting a mouse, an industry of beetles dissecting a\n          bird's carcass. Finally, we come to a small, deep cavity --\n          and there, tucked away in the darkness, we find --\n\n<b>          WOMAN (V.0.)\n</b>          And that's how it ended. With another\n          beginning. A kind of balance struck\n          between the flame and the fury.\n\n<b>                         BLAZE'S COIN\n</b>          balanced perfectly on it's edge. How it fell like that, at\n          the heart of the wreckage, is a mystery that will probably\n          never be solved.\n\n<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>          INT.

The nurse tacks the card to a wall filled with\n          many -- dozens and dozens of postcards charting Blaze's\n          journey back and forth across the country.\n          And we realize now, that Roxanne is the woman who has been\n          narrating our tale.\n\n<b>                         (CONTINUED)\n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>                         \n</b>\n<b>          117.\n</b>\n<b>                         CONTINUED:\n</b>\n<b>          ROXANNE (V.O.)\n</b>          And me?

There\n          are sharks. And there are doves. And\n          nighttime holds far darker terrors than\n          death. But I am never afraid because I\n          know that he is out there, somewhere.\n          And that someday, somehow --\n          Blaze ignites, SCREAMS, hurls back his head --\n\n<b>          ROXANNE (V.O.)
