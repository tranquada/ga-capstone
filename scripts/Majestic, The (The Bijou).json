The Carthay Circle.  The\nParamount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing\nwas a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The\nushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded\njackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and\nfresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>THE PILE OF POSTCARDS\n</b>\na wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top\nof the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of\nlights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt.

PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer,\nuntil we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and\nbehind it until we're looking down at...\n\n<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT\n</b>\n<b>SUPER TITLE: 1951\n</b>\nA gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy\nmidsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING\nHORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened\noutlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home\nconstruction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being\nbuilt in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,\na swath of garishly bright concrete called\n\n<b>HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.\n</b>\n<b>                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n</b>          Of course, it's not like the\n          postcards say it is.  This is what\n          it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and\n          this is my town.\n\nStill in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the\nintersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the\nboulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and\nFrank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian\nTheater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across\nHighland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the\nstreet to\n\n<b>GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.\n</b>\n<b>                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n</b>          Born and raised here, thank you\n          very much.  Sometimes, it seems\n          like everyone here is from\n          somewhere else.  But everyone loves\n          the movies, so Hollywood is\n          everyone's town, and they come here\n          by the busload.  To them, Grauman's\n          Chinese Theater is just about the\n          most exciting place on the planet. \n          To me, it's the theater that's\n          playing \"The African Queen.\"\n\nAnd like the man said, the film on the marquee is \"THE\nAFRICAN QUEEN.\"  Still the same shot, buses disgorge\nTOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The\nMEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull\ntheir blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with\nmovie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. \nWe MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay\nbehind them as they work their way through the crowd, on\ntheir way to\n\n<b>THE THEATER ENTRANCE,\n</b>\nwhere an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their\ntickets.\n\n<b>                    DOORMAN\n</b>          Newsreel's just starting, folks.\n\n<b>                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n</b>          That's me and my girlfriend.  Her\n          name is Sandra Sinclair, and this\n          is her town, too -- she's from\n          Cleveland.  She came out here to be\n          an actress, and that's just what\n          she's doing.  The first picture I\n          ever wrote, a little potboiler\n          called \"Sand Pirates of the\n          Sahara.\"  Okay, it ain't \"Citizen\n          Kane,\" but you gotta start\n          somewhere.\n\n<b>MOVING INTO THE LOBBY\n</b>\nan explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. \nEverywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting\nand golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the\nsame shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the\nauditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect\nUSHERS and we move into\n\n<b>THE DARKENED THEATER.\n</b>\nAs the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the\nsoundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the\nunmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the\nsame shot -- we see the screen...\n\n<b>A NEWSREEL.\n</b>\nAs the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL\n<b>ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:\n</b>\n<b>                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n</b>          Bringing the news of the world to\n          you!\n\nOver a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee\nHearing Room, a title blares \"HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!\"\n\n<b>                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n</b>          Four years ago, in one of\n          filmland's darkest hours, ten men,\n          the so-called \"Hollywood Ten,\" were\n          called to testify before the House\n          Committee of Un-American\n          Activities, investigating the\n          proliferation of the dreaded Red\n          Menace in Hollywood.\n\nWe see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal\nbattles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. \nJOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.\n\n<b>                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n</b>          Refusing to answer the lawmaker's\n          questions, cowering behind the\n          Fifth Amendment's protection\n          against self-incrimination, the ten\n          motion picture writers dared\n          Congress to come after them.  Well,\n          come after them they did!  And\n          after years of court wrangling,\n          it's now time to pay the piper!\n\nOver shots of several of the \"Hollywood Ten\" being led to\njail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.\n\n<b>                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n</b>          And so, it's off to jail, the\n          charge: Contempt of Congress!

It's as though the architect took random parts of a\nChinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall\nand a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good\nshake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly\nbuilt the result.\n\nAs a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was\n\"The Bijou,\" you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message\n\n<b>                        \" HE B J U\"\n</b>\nwas trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.\n\nAnd now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the \" HE B\nJ U\" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind\nthe building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN\nROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a\ntrainquake.  The \"J\" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening\nto dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.\n\n<b>LUKE\n</b>\nstares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has\nsunk to somewhere below his knees.\n\nThe Bijou.\n\nHarry jumps out of the car excitedly.\n\n<b>                    HARRY\n</b>          Thanks for the lift, Cecil.\n\n<b>                    ELDRIDGE\n</b>          Don't mention it.

BIJOU LOBBY - DAY\n</b>\nThe interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by\nthe exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in\nshards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross\nbetween a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with\ngenerous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable\ncombination of questionable taste and neglect.\n\nAbove the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --\nprobably the only truly beautiful item in the whole\ntheater --\n\n<b>A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.\n</b>\nEven under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut\ncrystal seem to pick up every available point of light and\nscatter it in a hundred directions.\n\n<b>TILT DOWN TO REVEAL\n</b>\nLuke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf\nsomewhere between surprise and disgust.\n\n<b>                    HARRY\n</b>          We've been closed for a while.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>              (smiling wanly)\n          Ah.\n\nLuke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one\nopen.\n\n<b>INT.

He picks a seat on\nthe aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he\ndoes, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another\nseat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and\nbackstage.

Some\n          of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,\n          Sacramento, San Francisco.

It's a\nNorman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue\nolive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one\narm around Harry and the other around his mother.\n\n(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even\nin a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)\n\n<b>                    HARRY\n</b>          The day you shipped out.

He's CARL LEFFERT,\n30s.\n\n<b>                    CARL\n</b>              (eagerly)\n          Hey, Luke, remember the time you\n          and me, we was playing with\n          firecrackers and the one you was\n          lighting blew up too soon and\n          singed all the hair offa my head?\n\nA few people shake their heads, smile and laugh.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>          Uh, no.

But they grew\n          back.\n\nLuke leans toward Harry, who never looks up from his chicken.\n\n<b>                    HARRY\n</b>          Carl.  Friend of yours from high\n          school.

Hey, Luke, you\n          remember my brother Bob?  You two\n          joined up the same day.\n\nLuke smiles and nods at the young man sitting next to Carl.\n\n<b>BOB LEFFERT\n</b>\nis a good-looking fellow, a few years older than Carl.  His\nface is pale and downcast, and he wears a cap pulled down on\nhis forehead.  He looks up at Luke with hollow eyes.  Brings\nhis right hand up, pushes the brim of his cap up.  Except\nthere's no hand there -- it's a hook.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>              (quietly)\n          Hey, Bob.  Good to meet you.\n\nBob doesn't react.  He glances away, and for a moment, his\neyes meet Mabel's.  She smiles warmly.  He turns away.\n\nErnie Cole pipes up.\n\n<b>                    ERNIE\n</b>          Luke, I know there's a question\n          that's on everybody's mind.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>          What's that?\n\n<b>                    ERNIE\n</b>          Well, now that you're back, what're\n          your plans?\n\nAll eyes on Luke.  He freezes, having just taken a forkful of\nfood in his mouth.  Harry jumps in.\n\n<b>                    HARRY\n</b>          Gonna re-open the Bijou, that's\n          what.\n\nA MURMUR goes through the crowd.

He's a tall, dark-haired, gangly, bespectacled\nkid, no more than 19 or 20.  Painfully shy, he clutches a\nclarinet case to his chest.  He timidly smiles and waves at\nLuke, who smiles and nods back.\n\n<b>                    SPENCER\n</b>          Hey, Luke.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>          Hi, Spencer.\n\n<b>                    ERNIE\n</b>          Spence, that band of yours -- you\n          think they're ready to play?\n              (to Luke)\n          Spencer and his pals went ahead and\n          got together a good ol' big band.\n\n<b>                    SPENCER\n</b>          We've been practicing... uh, sure,\n          I guess.\n\n<b>                    ERNIE\n</b>          Well, how about tomorrow night,\n          eight p.m., in city hall square? \n          What I'm proposin' is a \"Welcome\n          Home Luke\" celebration.\n\nVociferous general AGREEMENT from the crowd -- which is\nquickly quieted by a MURMUR, which starts at the front door. \nThe crowd parts and grow silent, revealing a woman standing\nin the doorway.\n\n<b>ADELE\n</b>\nShe locks eyes with Luke.  Her hand goes to her mouth and her\neyes well up.  Slowly, she moves around the counter, the\ncrowd moving aside for her.\n\nShe stands in front of Luke, who has stood up to meet her. \nHer eyes moist, she looks up at him.\n\n<b>                    ADELE\n</b>          Do you... remember me?\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>          I've seen you before.

You wanted nothing more\n          than to be able to play like him. \n          You tried hard, but it wasn't long\n          before it was clear that Benny\n          Goodman would never be looking over\n          his shoulder.

Adele rests her\nhead on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed.  Luke strokes her\nhair and sways her gently to the music.\n\nLuke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.\n\n<b>LUKE'S POV\n</b>\nBob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band.

BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n</b>\nLuke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees\n\n<b>CAT\n</b>\nMEOWING at him from the sidewalk.  He holds the door open,\nand Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the\nauditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS\nsomething, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. \nThe melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.\n\nLuke turns toward the music, which is coming from the\nauditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in\nvolume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively\npushes one open.\n\n<b>INT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n</b>\nLuke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,\nreflected light of\n\n<b>THE SCREEN.\n</b>\nThe movie is \"The Big Parade.\"  The old, decomposing nitrate\nprint is badly scratched and stained.  A young, beautiful\nRenee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John\nGilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.\n\nLuke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of\nbewilderment -- and awe.\n\n<b>ANGLE - THE PIANO\n</b>\nThe rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-\nof-tune.  But it really doesn't matter.\n\n<b>CLOSER\n</b>\nMrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes\nher eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered\nscreen, except to close them when she is overcome with\nemotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat.\n\n<b>HER HANDS\n</b>\nfairly dance upon the keys.  Stiff and wrinkled as they are,\nthey manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity\nthat the old piano can muster.\n\nLuke is moved by what he's witnessing.  This is the magic...\n\n<b>WIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION\n</b>\nTo the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old\nTim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene\nunfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and\nnose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice\n\n<b>LUKE\n</b>\nwho looks up towards the projection booth.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>A BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,\n</b>\nfilling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of\nlight radiating from the projector.\n\nPUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the\nbooth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out\nthe figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the\nprojector.\n\nWE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's\nface fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are\nwide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's\nunfolding on the screen for the very first time.\n\nThe warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,\nsignaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the\nwindow.\n\n<b>INT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n</b>\nNever taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the\nfilm comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the\nprojector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs\napart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the\nmovie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.\n\nHarry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades\nthem up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back\npocket and blows his nose loudly.\n\nHe crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up\nreel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he\nsenses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to\nsee\n\n<b>LUKE,\n</b>\nstanding there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say\nsomething -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels\nvery out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's\ninterrupted a very private ritual.\n\nHarry senses this.

Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He\nraises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who\nscream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.\n\n<b>INT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY\n</b>\nOld Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the\naisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten\ncarpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.\n\nThe men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just\nas they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to\nHarry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later,\nsomeone else grabs Old Tim's end.\n\n<b>BOB LEFFERT\n</b>\nhas a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his\nhook.

Then,\nas Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and\nMrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall\npaint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work\npainting.\n\n<b>EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY\n</b>\nLuke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool\nbox nearby.  He's just straightened out the \"J\" and he steps\nback... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first\ntime in a long time, the sign actually reads, \"THE BIJOU.\"\n\nBut not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts\nshaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke\nlunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. \nOnce again, the sign reads, \" HE B J U.\"  Luke winces.\n\n<b>EXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY\n</b>\nErnie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a\nsmall group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it\ntakes shape in a prominent place in the square...\n\n<b>INT.

Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge,\nstanding below, applaud enthusiastically.\n\n<b>INT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY\n</b>\nAs work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just\nfinished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover\nand trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits,\ncloses her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude\nNo. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a\nbit out of tune, it's still beautiful.\n\nAs she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before\nlong, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. \nTransported.\n\nAfter a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. \nSurprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.\n\n<b>                    LUKE\n</b>          That was beautiful.\n\n<b>                    MRS.

You used to call it\n          \"heaven music.\"  \"Teach me some\n          heaven music,\" you used to say.\n\nShe sits at the piano.\n\n<b>                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n</b>          Sit.

As she begins to\nplay a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.\n\n<b>                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n</b>          That's good... that's good...\n\nBut it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just\nplunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures\nhe's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's\ntransformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie\nwoogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.\n\n<b>                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n</b>          Really, Luke!  That's no way to\n          treat Mr. Chopin!\n\nShe stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning\nmadly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs\nover and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top\nhalf to Luke's bass line.\n\n<b>OLD TIM\n</b>\nis tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says:\n\n<b>                    OLD TIM\n</b>          I taught him that.\n\nOff Adele cracking up.\n\n<b>THE MONTAGE CONTINUES...\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY\n</b>\nLuke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his\nwatch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train\ngoes by.  This time, however, only the \"J\" tips over at a\njaunty angle.  Luke smiles.\n\n<b>INT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY\n</b>\nLuke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter,\ndevouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed\npotatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically\nwhite from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are\nstained with paint specks.\n\nAt the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably\nwith Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to\nrefill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back\nto the newspaper he's reading.\n\n<b>INSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN\n</b>\nProminent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a\npoliceman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying\nheadline:\n\n<b>               BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S\n</b><b>               JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH\n</b>                Hollywood Writer Feared Dead\n                 Were Red Agents Involved?\n\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

He throws the\nswitch...\n\n... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel\nthe rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle\nand shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele,\nHarry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted,\nLuke takes a formal bow.

He finishes his remarks,\nthen picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost\nlives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head.\n\n<b>ON THE CROWD\n</b>\nOne-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly\nheld aloft by their loved ones.\n\nLuke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out\nat the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. \nLuke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...\n\n<b>LUKE'S POV\n</b>\nIt's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in\nhis dress greens.  He brings his hook-hand up and salutes\nsmartly.

I'm real\n          proud of you.\n              (to the driver)\n          Okay, let's go.\n              (to Pete)\n          Get some rest, kid!\n\nAs the limo pulls away, we\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY\n</b>\nThe door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen\nPete, carrying his suitcases and hat.  He sets them down and\ngoes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from\nthe studio have been gathering dust these last three months.\n\n<b>                    SUPER\n</b>              (handing him a key)\n          Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr.\n          Kubelsky, he's got you paid up\n          through this month.  You got one\n          swell friend there.\n\nThe Super moves to the door and turns back.\n\n<b>                    SUPER\n</b>          Good to have you back, Pete.\n\nHe exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out\nthe tin-toy fire truck.  Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back\nin the box and replies too late:\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>          Thanks...\n\nHe sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat.  As he\ndoes, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat\npocket and falls open to the floor.\n\nPete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the\ninscription inside the front cover catches his eye:\n\n<b>                         TO DELLY,\n</b><b>               THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS.\n</b><b>                         LOVE, LUKE\n</b>\nPete closes the book.  He thinks for a moment, then glances\nover at the phone.  He picks it up and dials \"0.\"\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>          Western Union, please.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY\n</b>\nOur view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up\nthe spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara.  Looking\ninto one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring\nout at the passing scenery.\n\n<b>                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n</b>          Dear Adele, on my way back to\n          Lawson STOP.  That is, if they'll\n          have me STOP.  Train arrives four\n          p.m. STOP.  Hope you can be there\n          STOP.  Pete.\n\n<b>                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON\n</b>\nThe train is just pulling in to Lawson.  As it SHUDDERS to a\nhalt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete\nsteps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open...\n\n<b>HIS POV\n</b>\nThe ENTIRE TOWN has turned out.  They're all there, smiling\nbroadly.  A large, hand-lettered banner reads:\n\n<b>                     WELCOME HOME PETE!\n</b><b>                   LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON\n</b>\nA CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence.  Pete\ndescends from the train and moves into the throng.  The first\ntwo people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. \nbob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling\nas they shake hands vigorously.\n\n<b>                    BOB\n</b>          Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it\n          weren't for you, I wouldn't have\n          had the nerve to ask this fine\n          woman to marry me.\n\nMabel's mouth drops open.\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>          Bob, congratulations!  When'd you\n          ask her?\n\n<b>                    MABEL\n</b>          Holy moley!  Just now!\n              (to Bob)\n          Yes, Bob!  Yes!\n\nAs Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into\nthe crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back.\n\n<b>ADELE\n</b>\nis at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. \nShe rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss.  Another CHEER\ngoes up.\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>          I see you got the telegram.\n\n<b>                    ADELE\n</b>          Pete, I'm so sorry about what they\n          did to you.  I didn't think you'd\n          come back, I thought you'd want to\n          write again...\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>          Dell, I can't write unless I'm\n          happy, and I can't be happy unless\n          I'm here -- and with you.\n              (grabs her shoulders)\n          This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. \n          And I love you!\n\n<b>                    ADELE\n</b>              (tears in her eyes)\n          And (hic!) I love you, Pete!\n\nThey kiss again.  Pete pulls away and looks at his watch.\n\n<b>                    PETE\n</b>              (smiling)\n          C'mon, Dell, we gotta go.  Showtime\n          in fifteen minutes.\n\nThe train whistle BLOWS as it slowly pulls out of the\nstation.\n\n<b>                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n</b>          \"Happily ever after\" is a relative\n          term, folks.  My world is much\n          smaller now, and my dreams are very\n          different than they were.  But I\n          have something now that I never had\n          before: I have the magic.  And\n          it's for sale at the Bijou, every\n          day of the year.  All you need is\n          the price of a ticket.\n\nWe BOOM UP to see Pete and Adele moving into and being\nenveloped by the crowd.\n\nSpencer Wyatt's band is assembled in front of the depot\noffice, and they kick into some up-tempo boogie-woogie as we\nmove up and away -- still in the same shot -- moving over the\ntown, settling down again to grab a shot of the Bijou's\nmarquee.  The neon chaser lights POP ON, illuminating the\nsign, which reads:\n\n<b>                          THE END\n</b>\nThen, the letters on the marquee START SHAKING.  We BOOM UP\nTO THE TOP OF THE THEATER, and the \"BIJOU\" sign...\n\n... as the train RUMBLES BY behind the theater...\n\n... and the \"J\" teeters loose and swings by a thread...\n\n... and we IRIS DOWN ON IT AND...\n\n<b>                                            CUT TO BLACK.\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Majestic, The (The Bijou)</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Slone\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Slone\">Michael Slone</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Majestic, The (The Bijou) Script.html#comments\" title=\"Majestic, The (The Bijou) comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:10:51.166070"}
