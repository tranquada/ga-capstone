HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT\n\nSUPER TITLE: 1951\n\nA gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy\nmidsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING\nHORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened\noutlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home\nconstruction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being\nbuilt in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,\na swath of garishly bright concrete called\n\nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          Of course, it's not like the\n          postcards say it is.  This is what\n          it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and\n          this is my town.\n\nStill in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the\nintersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the\nboulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and\nFrank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian\nTheater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across\nHighland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the\nstreet to\n\nGRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          Born and raised here, thank you\n          very much.  Sometimes, it seems\n          like everyone here is from\n          somewhere else.  But everyone loves\n          the movies, so Hollywood is\n          everyone's town, and they come here\n          by the busload.  To them, Grauman's\n          Chinese Theater is just about the\n          most exciting place on the planet. \n          To me, it's the theater that's\n          playing \"The African Queen.\"\n\nAnd like the man said, the film on the marquee is \"THE\nAFRICAN QUEEN.\"  Still the same shot, buses disgorge\nTOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The\nMEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull\ntheir blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with\nmovie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. \nWe MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay\nbehind them as they work their way through the crowd, on\ntheir way to\n\nTHE THEATER ENTRANCE,\n\nwhere an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their\ntickets.\n\n                    DOORMAN\n          Newsreel's just starting, folks.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          That's me and my girlfriend.  Her\n          name is Sandra Sinclair, and this\n          is her town, too -- she's from\n          Cleveland.  She came out here to be\n          an actress, and that's just what\n          she's doing.  The first picture I\n          ever wrote, a little potboiler\n          called \"Sand Pirates of the\n          Sahara.\"  Okay, it ain't \"Citizen\n          Kane,\" but you gotta start\n          somewhere.\n\nMOVING INTO THE LOBBY\n\nan explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. \nEverywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting\nand golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the\nsame shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the\nauditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect\nUSHERS and we move into\n\nTHE DARKENED THEATER.\n\nAs the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the\nsoundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the\nunmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the\nsame shot -- we see the screen...\n\nA NEWSREEL.\n\nAs the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL\nANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:\n\n                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n          Bringing the news of the world to\n          you!\n\nOver a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee\nHearing Room, a title blares \"HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!\"\n\n                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n          Four years ago, in one of\n          filmland's darkest hours, ten men,\n          the so-called \"Hollywood Ten,\" were\n          called to testify before the House\n          Committee of Un-American\n          Activities, investigating the\n          proliferation of the dreaded Red\n          Menace in Hollywood.\n\nWe see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal\nbattles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. \nJOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE.\n\n                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n          Refusing to answer the lawmaker's\n          questions, cowering behind the\n          Fifth Amendment's protection\n          against self-incrimination, the ten\n          motion picture writers dared\n          Congress to come after them.  Well,\n          come after them they did!  And\n          after years of court wrangling,\n          it's now time to pay the piper!\n\nOver shots of several of the \"Hollywood Ten\" being led to\njail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues.\n\n                    NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER\n          And so, it's off to jail, the\n          charge: Contempt of Congress!

A new round of\n          investigations begins this fall,\n          the mandate: Get the reds out of\n          Hollywood!\n\nIn the audience, one man YELLS \"Lock up the commie\nbastards!,\" and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the\nnewsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we\nWHEEL AROUND AND...\n\nENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR.\n\nPete's a handsome fellow in his 30s, and Sandra's a starlet\npretty girl in her mid-20s.  As she rummages in her purse,\nPete watches the newsreel.\n\n                    SANDRA\n          Pete, there's time before the\n          picture starts, you want to get\n          some popcorn?\n\n                    PETE\n          You bet, honey.\n\nPete kisses Sandra on the cheek, then stands and sprints up\nthe aisle to the concession stand, a big unworried grin on\nhis face.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          We were young, we were in love, and\n          we were working in pictures. \n          Life... was good.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.

He looks at the cover of the first one:\n\n                \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\"\n                     By Peter Appleton\n                A United Pictures Production\n                     February 19, 1951\n\nPete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the\nsecond one:\n\n                      \"ASHES TO ASHES\"\n                     By Peter Appleton\n\nHe jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box,\nwhich contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold\npillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy\nfire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns\nit around in his hands.\n\n                    PETE\n              (musing)\n          Huh.  Red...\n\nFootsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door.\n\n                    SANDRA (O.S.)\n          Pete?  Pete...?\n\nSandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis\nXIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and\nembraces him.\n\n                    SANDRA\n          Oh, Pete...\n\nThey kiss.  The Guard watches their every move.\n\n                    SANDRA\n          What happened?\n\n                    PETE\n          What exactly did you hear?\n\n                    SANDRA\n          That you got let go.\n\n                    PETE\n          I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie\n          Ruskin directing the picture you're\n          in?\n\n                    SANDRA\n          He was, but he got sick.  We got a\n          new director today.  Why?\n\n                    PETE\n          Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's\n          catching.\n\n                    SANDRA\n          You mean, he was... let go, too?\n\n                    PETE\n              (sotto, an appeal)\n          They're saying I'm a communist,\n          Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. \n          I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna\n          win, but I'll need your help.\n\nDuring this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling\naway from Pete.\n\n                    PETE\n          A lot of good people are being\n          accused of things they didn't do. \n          Hell, even if I was a communist,\n          this is America, goddammit, a\n          person should be able to be\n          whatever they want to be!  Right?\n\nSandra glances at the Guard, who is watching everything.\n\n                    SANDRA\n              (nervously)\n          Of course, but I... I don't know\n          how I... how much help I can be to\n          you.  This is the sort of thing...\n          someone saying you're a\n          communist... it can ruin your\n          career.\n\nPete sees where this is going.  She's edging toward the door.\n\n                    PETE\n          Will you help me, Sandy?\n\n                    SANDRA\n          I'll have to think about this.  I\n          have to get back... I should go...\n\nAnd she's out the door and gone in the blink of an eye.  Pete\nlooks at the Guard.\n\n                    PETE\n          So nice to be a pariah.\n\nThe Guard turns away.  Pete moves back toward the boxes. \nRummaging again, he comes up with a bottle of Jack Daniels\nwith barely one swig left.  He regards the bottle for a\nmoment, looks to see if the Guard is watching (he isn't),\npops the cork, puts it to his lips and drains it.  He looks\nat it thoughtfully as we\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nA HALF-FULL BOTTLE OF JACK DANIELS setting down on a bartop.\n\nWIDER\n\nINT.  THE FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe bottle is in front of Pete, who sits at the bar, quietly\ngetting stewed.  The Frolic Room is a classic Hollywood dive,\ndimly lit and full of character and characters.  It's a quiet\nnight and getting quieter, as several PATRONS are just\nleaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, JERRY, early 40s. \nJerry turns to Pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of\nthe bar.  Pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. \nGood boy, he got most of it in the glass.\n\n                    JERRY\n          Pete.  You think maybe you've had\n          enough?\n\n                    PETE\n          Bought the bottle, didn't I?\n              (raises the shot)\n          To the United States of America. \n          Long my she wave.\n\nHe knocks it back and Jerry pours him another.\n\n                    PETE\n              (trying to light a smoke)\n          Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.\n\n                    JERRY\n          What.\n\n                    PETE\n          You tight with J.

Edgar Hoover walked in\n          here wearing a dress, I wouldn't\n          know him.\n\n                    PETE\n          Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.\n\n                    JERRY\n              (glancing around)\n          You should watch what you say.  You\n          don't know who's listening.\n\n                    PETE\n          You know I'm not a communist, don't\n          you, Jer?\n\n                    JERRY\n          Sure, I suppose.  That why you're\n          on a bender?\n\n                    PETE\n          This is not a bender yet.  This is\n          the start of a bender.  But I can\n          see how you were confused, they\n          look a lot alike.\n\nPete drains his shotglass, puts it back on the bar.  He\nwatches Jerry, who is not about to refill it.  Pete reaches\nfor the bottle, but Jerry is faster.  \n\n                    JERRY\n          Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll\n          call that girlfriend of yours,\n          what's her name...

C'mon,\n          let's call her.\n\nPeter stands, stubs out his smoke, drops a few crumpled bills\non the bar and grabs his hat.\n\n                    PETE\n          Nope.  Can't.  We're through.\n\n                    JERRY\n          Then I'll call you a cab.\n\n                    PETE\n          I'll save you the trouble.\n              (beat)\n          I'm a cab.  There.  Did it myself.\n\nPete's preoccupied with putting on his hat and getting his\ncar keys out of his coat pocket, a daunting task in his\ncondition.\n\n                    PETE\n          'Sides, car's right outside.

FROLIC ROOM - NIGHT\n\nPete takes a few steps, stumbles, stops, takes a deep breath,\nthen totters briskly towards his car.  He hauls the door open\nand sits inside heavily.\n\nINT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\nSitting slumped against the steering wheel, Pete looks as\nthough he could fall asleep right there, which would probably\nbe a good idea.\n\n                    PETE\n              (mumbling)\n          Drive.  Drive.  Bad idea.  Too\n          drunk to drive.\n\nHe looks at his watch.\n\n                    PETE\n          One-thirty.  Huh!  Early.  Can't go\n          home yet.\n\nHe turns the key and hits the starter.  The engine hums to\nlife.  Pete sits up, opens his eyes wide, shakes off the haze\nand puts the car in gear.\n\nThe Plymouth lurches forward a few yards, screeches to a halt\nand stalls.\n\n                    PETE\n          Oops.\n\nHe re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and\ndown the deserted boulevard.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT\n\nThe full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at\nthe edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris\nwheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark\nand eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep\nin the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his\nface, snoring.\n\nThe waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake.\n\n                    PETE\n          Huh?  Whatsa...\n\nInstantly, he grabs his head.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          I had no idea how I got to Santa\n          Monica, but it certainly was a good\n          idea.  I don't think I could've\n          faced the headache I had alone in\n          my apartment.  At least I had the\n          ocean air.\n\nPete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out\nhis cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at\nhis watch.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          Three forty-five.  I had only been\n          there for a couple of hours at\n          most.  Truth be told, I was still\n          fairly drunk.\n\nHe starts the car and heads for the highway.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          I'd head north until the sun came\n          up or I ran out of gas, whichever\n          came first.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT\n\nPete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.  Waves crash\nto the shore below the roadway.\n\nINT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT\n\nPete is finally relaxed.  He takes off his hat and jams it\ndown in the back seat.  He takes a deep breath -- with the\nwind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at\npeace.  He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the\nfuel gauge.\n\nINSERT - FUEL GAUGE\n\nPinning on \"empty.\"\n\n                    PETE\n          Shit.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          Guess which came first.\n\nHe scans the road ahead -- nothing.  Glances to his right.\n\nPETE'S POV\n\nThe lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance.\n\nPete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that\nwill take him toward the lights.  He passes a hand-painted\nsign that gives him hope: \"GAS - 1 MI.\"\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nEXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT\n\nPete's car rolls up and stops.  There's a light on the sign\nand another in the station's window, but the place is\ndeserted.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          I should've known better than to\n          think that a service station in the\n          sticks would be open at this hour,\n          but it wasn't like I had a lot of\n          choices.\n\nPete looks ahead toward the town.  Its few lights twinkle in\nthe distance.\n\n                    PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)\n          What the hell.  At least there'd be\n          a diner opening in a couple of\n          hours.  I'd get some pie and\n          coffee, and then I could worry\n          about the gas.\n\nPete pulls out onto the road.\n\nEXT.  ROAD - NIGHT\n\nPete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted\nroadside sign which reads:\n\n                           SLOW!\n         NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL\n                        USE CAUTION!\n\nINT./ EXT.

BRIDGE - NIGHT\n\n... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and\ninto the rapidly-moving water below!\n\nEXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT\n\nThe water is flowing very quickly, and the current is\nintense.  Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat\n(thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the\nwindshield.\n\nBut... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.  Nearly\nout of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and\nheads for the surface.\n\nEXT.  THE WASH - NIGHT\n\nPete breaks the surface and gasps for air.  His fight isn't\nover yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. \nHe swims with all his might toward the far bank.\n\nEXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT\n\nDrained, Pete pulls himself out of the water and staggers to\nhis feet.\n\n                    PETE\n              (gasping)\n          Oh my god!  I don't believe... oh\n          my god...\n\nHe stumbles along backwards a couple of steps... and his heel\nhits a rock...\n\nPete falls backward -- and his head strikes a glancing blow\non another rock.  He rolls down the bank, unconscious, and\nlands face down in the mud.\n\n                                            CUT TO BLACK.\n\nIN BLACK, we slowly become aware of a panting, breathing\nsound -- the sound of a dog...\n\nFADE IN:\n\nON A DOG'S FACE\n\nA yellow labrador, full frame.

FAR BANK OF THE WASH - DAWN\n\nPete is still laying face down on the bank, being fervently\nlicked in the face by the dog.\n\nON THE OLD MAN\n\nA no-nonsense sort in his late-60s, he wears overalls and an\nold railroad cap.  He comes down to Pete, and using his\nwalking stick, pokes him in the side.\n\n                    OLD MAN\n          Mister, who are ya?  my dog likes\n          you, but that don't mean much, she\n          likes skunks, too.

Lawson is a bit run\ndown, creeping inexorably toward decrepit.  Despite that,\nthere's a timeless quality to the small buildings, a familiar\nAll-American feel.\n\nSeveral of the PEOPLE walking along the street take notice of\nPete and nod to Stanton, who nods back.\n\n                    PETE\n          They all know you?\n\n                    STANTON\n          'Course they all know me.

It's as though the architect took random parts of a\nChinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall\nand a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good\nshake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly\nbuilt the result.\n\nAs a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was\n\"The Bijou,\" you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message\n\n                        \" HE B J U\"\n\nwas trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet.\n\nAnd now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the \" HE B\nJ U\" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind\nthe building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN\nROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a\ntrainquake.  The \"J\" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening\nto dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers.\n\nLUKE\n\nstares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has\nsunk to somewhere below his knees.\n\nThe Bijou.\n\nHarry jumps out of the car excitedly.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Thanks for the lift, Cecil.\n\n                    ELDRIDGE\n          Don't mention it.

Harry grabs\nhis arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Wait'll you see the inside!\n\n                    LUKE\n              (deadpan)\n          Can't wait.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY\n\nThe interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by\nthe exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in\nshards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross\nbetween a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with\ngenerous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable\ncombination of questionable taste and neglect.\n\nAbove the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --\nprobably the only truly beautiful item in the whole\ntheater --\n\nA DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.\n\nEven under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut\ncrystal seem to pick up every available point of light and\nscatter it in a hundred directions.\n\nTILT DOWN TO REVEAL\n\nLuke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf\nsomewhere between surprise and disgust.\n\n                    HARRY\n          We've been closed for a while.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (smiling wanly)\n          Ah.\n\nLuke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one\nopen.\n\nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\nThe ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem\nto be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional\nrow seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved\nitself up against the row behind or in front.\n\nTHE SCREEN\n\nis really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin,\nframed by ragged red velveteen drapery.\n\nIn the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old\nupright piano.\n\nLuke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on\nthe aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he\ndoes, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another\nseat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and\nbackstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (turning to Harry)\n          Exactly how long has the Bijou been\n          closed?\n\n                    HARRY\n          Hmmmm... after you left, it was\n          difficult, and then Lily -- that's\n          your mother -- she took ill and\n          died... we haven't shown a picture\n          since forty-eight.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Why?\n\n                    HARRY\n              (deep breath)\n          Well, after the war, with so many\n          of the town's boys killed, people\n          around here didn't much feel like\n          going to the movies, I guess.  Some\n          of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles,\n          Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't\n          much to keep 'em here, I expect. \n          And now with this \"television\"\n          thing -- people just aren't going\n          out as much as they used to.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Didn't you have any help?\n\n                    HARRY\n          Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but\n          they really couldn't help much. \n          Broke their hearts when we closed\n          up.  Broke mine, too.\n              (brightening)\n          But now that you're back, well,\n          things will be different around\n          here, that's for sure.\n              (rises, grabs Luke's arm)\n          C'mon, I'll show you where we live.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY\n\nThe small apartment above the projection booth is quite a\ncontrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and\nfairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains,\nallowing the sun to flood the room.\n\nA beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are\n\nSEVERAL FRAMED PHOTOS.\n\nOne of the photos is of the real, much-younger Luke.  It's a\nNorman Rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army-issue\nolive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder.  He has one\narm around Harry and the other around his mother.\n\n(And by the way, Pete's resemblance to the real Luke -- even\nin a nearly 10 year old photo -- is pretty damn startling...)\n\n                    HARRY\n          The day you shipped out.  That was\n          a proud day for your mother and me. \n          Last time you saw her.  Last time I\n          saw you.\n\nHe smiles.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Till today.\n\nLuke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine\nlooking woman.  It's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from\nthe 30's.\n\n                    HARRY\n          That's Lily.

She\n          certainly made this place a home.\n\nHe takes the picture from Luke, kisses it, and gently\nreplaces it on the table.  Luke goes over to the sofa and\nsits.\n\n                    HARRY\n              (brightly)\n          Can I get you anything?  I can put\n          some coffee on or some...\n\nHarry looks at Luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep\non the sofa.\n\nHe goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts\nthem onto the sofa.  Removes his shoes, sets them on the\nfloor.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nA BLANKET\n\nbeing drawn up Luke's chest.\n\nHARRY\n\nstands, looks down warmly at his son.  Then, suddenly, he's\nseized by a thought.  He turns and crosses to the window.\n\nCLOSE - THE WINDOW\n\nThere's a small picture frame in the window.  Harry reaches\ndown, gingerly picks it up and turns it around.\n\nON THE FRAME\n\nIt's a single, faded gold star.  One war casualty.\n\nHarry clutches it to his chest, looks over at the sleeping\nLuke and smiles.\n\n                    HARRY\n              (softly)\n          When I woke up this morning, my son\n          was dead.

In the distance, a train sounds its HORN.\n\nLuke rolls over on his back, still asleep, snoring lightly. \nSlowly, he starts to wake up, eyes still closed.\n\nSomething's strange, though.  He frowns.  The train is\nGETTING CLOSER.  Luke's eyes POP OPEN.\n\nLUKE'S POV\n\nAs the train RUMBLES BY, shaking everything in the room, Luke\nlooks up to see three ancient cherubs staring down at him. \nHarry, an elderly WOMAN, and an elderly BLACK MAN.\n\n                    HARRY\n              (smiling)\n          'Morning, Son.\n\n                    ELDERLY WOMAN\n              (smiling)\n          Good morning, Luke.\n\n                    ELDERLY BLACK MAN\n              (no expression)\n          'Mornin'.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Sleep well?\n\nLuke is speechless.

He rubs the side of his head that is still bandaged. \nThe elderly woman nudges Harry gently.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Oh, I'm sorry, they know you, but\n          you don't... you need to be re-\n          introduced.  Luke, this is Mrs.\n          Irene Terwilliger.\n\nLuke stands and shakes MRS. TERWILLIGER'S hand.  She's tiny,\nseventy if she's a day.

His clothes are a tad shabby, but\nwell maintained, though they hang loosely on his gangly\nframe.  He wears an old blue knit cap, which he quickly\nremoves as he shakes Luke's hand.

CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT\n\n                    ADELE (O.S.)\n          When we were kids, my Dad was\n          mayor, and you and me and a bunch\n          of others used to come down here\n          all the time.\n\nON ADELE AND LUKE\n\nlooking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage\nroom, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the\nwindow.

It ought to be where\n          people can see it.\n\n                    ADELE\n          After they commissioned it, no one\n          could ever agree on where to put\n          it.  The Methodists wanted it in\n          front of the Methodist Church, the\n          Presbyterians wanted it in front of\n          the Presbyterian Church, the city\n          council wanted it in the lobby of\n          City Hall.  Everyone finally got\n          tired of the fighting.  So they\n          stuck it down here.\n\nHe looks at her for a long moment.  There's an electricity\nbetween them, and they both feel it.\n\n                    LUKE\n          So, you're really gonna be a\n          lawyer?\n\n                    ADELE\n              (suddenly defensive)\n          And why not?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Whoa.\n\n                    ADELE\n              (smiling)\n          Sorry.  You don't know how many\n          times I've heard that.  \"A lady\n          lawyer?  Are you crazy?\"  Like a\n          woman couldn't be as good a lawyer\n          as a man.

I\n          think you were gonna run the Bijou. \n          You were brought up there, and you\n          loved it so much.  And I think you\n          knew how much the town needed a\n          place like that.\n\nHe turns away, rubs his head.\n\n                    LUKE\n          I just wish I could remember some\n          of this.\n\nHe turns back to her.\n\n                    LUKE\n          You don't have a boyfriend or\n          anyone... you know... like that?\n\n                    ADELE\n          Actually, I was married.  For four\n          years.  But... well, we didn't fit\n          together.

How come Harry didn't mention\n          that?\n\nThe cat moves to the auditorium door, pausing to look back at\nLuke.  Curiosity piqued, Luke follows the cat.\n\nINT.  BIJOU BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT\n\nIn the dim light, we SEE an old mop and pail, some dirty film\ncans, and a large beat-up cardboard standee of \"The Tramp\"\nwith the legend, \"Chaplin Short To-Day.\"\n\nThe cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door\nat the end of a hallway.  Luke, following the cat, comes\naround the same corner and looks at\n\nTHE DOOR.\n\nSlightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as\nthe sound of Old Tim softly humming \"It's a Long Way to\nTipperary.\"\n\nLuke moves to the door and knocks.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. \n          It's Luke.

The reception is staying perfect. \nCaesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business,\nand Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles\nhis urge, and heads for his chair.

You were two\n          left feet on the dance floor.  Like\n          pulling teeth to get you to do a\n          little box step.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Guess I must've learned.\n\nLuke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on\nher face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone\nenthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing\nslightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he\nmotions for the crowd's attention.\n\n                    SPENCER\n              (nervously)\n          Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell\n          we never played in front of people\n          before?\n\nThe crowd yells \"No!,\" \"You guys sound great!,\" etc.\n\n                    SPENCER\n          Well, this is our first time, and\n          it's really all because of Luke.  I\n          mean, it's because of Luke coming\n          back that we're here tonight -- but\n          I'm talking about this.\n\nHe holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees\nLuke.\n\n                    SPENCER\n              (to Luke)\n          When you didn't come back, I\n          learned how to play this so I could\n          remember you.  And now that you're\n          back, well, I'll never forget you.\n              (to the crowd)\n          Luke gave me this clarinet, but he\n          gave this night to all of us.\n\nThe crowd APPLAUDS warmly.\n\n                    SPENCER\n          Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole!\n\nThe crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.  He\nturns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Pretty proud of your boy, Avery?\n\nAvery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six\ntimes to register his reaction.\n\nON THE KICK DRUM -- \"WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF.\"\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Looks like you might have to find\n          someone else to mix paint at the\n          store, 'cause I think Spencer's got\n          a big career ahead of him.\n\nAPPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as\nhe starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          You know folks, here in Lawson, we\n          gave a lot for our country.  A lot. \n          And we never complained and we\n          never faltered.  And we never\n          forgot.\n\nErnie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his\nthroat and continues.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          We never forgot.  And so when one\n          of our own came back to us, I gotta\n          tell you folks, it was like a\n          miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking\n          down the street, it was... well, it\n          was kinda like seein' one of my\n          boys alive again.  I think I speak\n          for everyone here when I say that\n          not a day goes by when we don't\n          keep our boys' memories alive.  But\n          Luke, having you back among us...\n          well, it helps us keep their\n          spirits alive, too.  God bless you,\n          son.\n\nThe crowd APPLAUDS.  Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. \nErnie wipes his eyes and changes the subject.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          All right, enough a'that.  This is\n          a celebration, so let's have us a\n          good time -- but not too good a\n          time, 'cause I see just about every\n          member of the city council here\n          tonight, and we have an eight a.m. \n          council meeting tomorrow morning,\n          and I expect y'all to be there! \n          All right, take it away, Spencer!\n\nAnd Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE SAME - LATER\n\nLuke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger,\nstanding at the periphery.  Old Tim stands a few feet back.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Why don't you two get out there and\n          dance?\n\n                    HARRY\n          Oh, no, I...\n\nMrs. Terwilliger blushes.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          I haven't danced with another man\n          since Mr. Terwilliger passed.\n\n                    LUKE\n          When was that?\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          Nineteen-oh-nine.\n\nHarry touches Luke's arm.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids\n          have a lovely time.\n\nGoodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.  Alex McKenna\ncomes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder.\n\n                    ALEX\n          Delly, can I have a dance?\n\n                    ADELE\n          Sure.\n\nAlex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a\nlittle \"help me!\" look.  Luke smiles back and watches the\ndancing crowd.  After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow\ntie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his\nhand.\n\n                    FITTS\n          Luke, you probably don't remember\n          me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer\n          here in town.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (shakes his hand)\n          Good to meet you.  Again.\n\n                    FITTS\n          Like Ernie said, we're all glad to\n          have you back.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Thanks.\n\n                    FITTS\n          And I hear you and Harry are\n          planning on re-opening the Bijou.\n\n                    LUKE\n          We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot\n          of work.\n\n                    FITTS\n          I can only imagine.  You know, I\n          spoke with your Dad last year about\n          maybe taking the Bijou off his\n          hands.  I don't think he gave it\n          very much thought.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, he loves the place.  It's his\n          home.\n\n                    FITTS\n          Luke, I'm hopping you can help him\n          see the reality of the situation. \n          I'll come to the point.  I want to\n          buy the property, and I'm prepared\n          to offer six-thousand dollars for\n          it.  And that's just for the\n          property, mind you.  If you want,\n          I'll leave it to you and your\n          father to dismantle and liquidate\n          the building for whatever salvage\n          value it has, and you keep those\n          proceeds.  I just want the land.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (taken aback)\n          That's... well, that's very\n          generous, but if you've already got\n          a store...?\n\n                    FITTS\n          The days of the storefront grocery\n          are numbered.  I plan on putting up\n          a free-standing supermarket.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (it's an alien word)\n          A super market.  Huh.\n\n                    FITTS\n          You think it over.  No reason to\n          risk financial ruin for the sake of\n          a crumbling old building.\n\nFitts takes Luke's hand and shakes it.\n\n                    FITTS\n          Good to have you back, Luke.\n\nAs Luke watches Fitts walk off, we\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nTHE SAME - LATER\n\nON SPENCER\n\n                    SPENCER\n          Last dance, folks!\n\nThe crowd MOANS slightly, and Spencer kicks the band into\n\"Moonlight Serenade,\" slow and easy.\n\nON ADELE AND LUKE\n\nAs they hold each other close and dance.  Adele rests her\nhead on Luke's shoulder, her eyes closed.  Luke strokes her\nhair and sways her gently to the music.\n\nLuke looks toward the edge of the dance floor.\n\nLUKE'S POV\n\nBob Leffert is standing there, staring at the band.  Mabel\ncomes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder.  She's\nasking him if he would like to dance.  Bob looks down at the\nground, self-consciously shoves his hook-hand in his pocket\nand moves away, leaving Mabel standing there.\n\nAs Luke watches and the MUSIC CONTINUES OVER, WE\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nMONTAGE:\n\nLuke and Adele dancing...\n\n... walking slowly arm-in-arm down Adele's street, up her\nwalk to her door...\n\n... kissing passionately on her doorstep...\n\n... Adele going inside and Luke walking away, each unable to\ntake their eyes off the other...\n\n... Luke walking the quiet streets of Lawson, smiling\nbeatifically...\n\n                                        MATCH DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  THE BIJOU - NIGHT\n\nLuke turns the corner and heads for the theater door.  He\npulls out his keys and enters.\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nLuke's about to close the door, when he looks down and sees\n\nCAT\n\nMEOWING at him from the sidewalk.  He holds the door open,\nand Cat shoots into the lobby, disappearing into the\nauditorium.  Luke closes the door... and stops.  He HEARS\nsomething, and so do we.  Soft and faraway, it's a PIANO. \nThe melody is soft, lilting -- almost a lullaby.\n\nLuke turns toward the music, which is coming from the\nauditorium.  The piano continues, building slightly in\nvolume.  He moves to the auditorium doors and tentatively\npushes one open.\n\nINT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nLuke enters, his face bathed in the soft, flickering,\nreflected light of\n\nTHE SCREEN.\n\nThe movie is \"The Big Parade.\"  The old, decomposing nitrate\nprint is badly scratched and stained.  A young, beautiful\nRenee Adoree is bidding a tearful farewell to her lover, John\nGilbert, as he marches off to fight the Great War.\n\nLuke stares at the screen.  The look on his face is one of\nbewilderment -- and awe.\n\nANGLE - THE PIANO\n\nThe rickety old upright is tinny-sounding and slightly out-\nof-tune.  But it really doesn't matter.\n\nCLOSER\n\nMrs. Terwilliger is playing passionately.  She never takes\nher eyes -- which are full of tears -- off the tattered\nscreen, except to close them when she is overcome with\nemotion.  Even so, she never misses a beat.\n\nHER HANDS\n\nfairly dance upon the keys.  Stiff and wrinkled as they are,\nthey manage to elicit every possible fragment of sensitivity\nthat the old piano can muster.\n\nLuke is moved by what he's witnessing.  This is the magic...\n\nWIDER ANGLE - THE CENTER SECTION\n\nTo the right of Luke, sitting in the center of a row, is Old\nTim.  Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene\nunfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and\nnose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice\n\nLUKE\n\nwho looks up towards the projection booth.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nA BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT,\n\nfilling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of\nlight radiating from the projector.\n\nPUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the\nbooth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out\nthe figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the\nprojector.\n\nWE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's\nface fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are\nwide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's\nunfolding on the screen for the very first time.\n\nThe warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES,\nsignaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the\nwindow.\n\nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nNever taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the\nfilm comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the\nprojector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs\napart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the\nmovie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have.\n\nHarry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades\nthem up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back\npocket and blows his nose loudly.\n\nHe crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up\nreel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he\nsenses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to\nsee\n\nLUKE,\n\nstanding there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say\nsomething -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels\nvery out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's\ninterrupted a very private ritual.\n\nHarry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film\ntightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles\nwarmly.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Beautiful, wasn't it?\n\n                    LUKE\n              (softly)\n          Yes.\n\n                    HARRY\n          Well, son, I wish I could've shown\n          you more, but this is all that's\n          left.  Just this one reel that\n          never got sent back from a picture\n          we showed here a long time ago. \n          Nineteen twenty-five, to be\n          exact...\n\n                    LUKE\n          Dad, I...\n\n                    HARRY\n              (a tiny laugh)\n          Ha!\n\n                    LUKE\n          ... what?\n\n                    HARRY\n          You know, since you've been back,\n          that's the first time you've called\n          me \"Dad.\"\n\nFather and son look at each other for a long moment --\nsearching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half-\nsmile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the\nrewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end\nof the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn\nthe crank, rewinding the film.\n\nHe stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not\nthere.\n\nANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR\n\nLuke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the\nprojection booth.\n\nONE LUKE\n\nAs he closes his eyes...\n\n                                           FADE TO BLACK.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nON HARRY\n\nIn bed, sound asleep, snoring.  A HAND reaches into frame and\nshakes him awake.\n\n                    LUKE'S VOICE\n          Harry.  Dad, wake up.  Wake up.\n\nHarry opens his eyes and looks up.\n\nINT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n                    HARRY\n              (bleary)\n          Luke... what time is it?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Six-thirty.\n              (smiles)\n          I thought we'd get an early start.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nINT.  CITY COUNCIL MEETING ROOM - DAY\n\nA meeting of the Lawson City Council is in session, Mayor\nCole presiding.  Of the dozen council MEMBERS, we also\nrecognize Avery Wyatt and Roscoe Fitts.  VERA DWIGHT, the\ncouncil secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading\nthe minutes of the last meeting.\n\n                    VERA\n          Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and\n          Red Curtis seconded, that the\n          council form a committee to\n          investigate the adoption of a new\n          property taxation structure. \n          Motion carried, nine to two, one\n          abstention.\n\nAs Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry,\nOld Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on\nthe unoccupied benches.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Thanks, Vera.\n\nErnie notices Luke and the trio.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Well, the chair notes the presence\n          this morning of Luke and Harry\n          Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou\n          staff.  Frankly, the chair notes\n          the presence of just about anyone\n          who ever finds their way into one\n          of these meetings.  G'moring,\n          folks.\n\n                    LUKE & THE TRIO\n          Good morning.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          I'm just guessing, but I bet it's\n          not a sudden interest in Lawson\n          politics that brings you all here.\n\nLuke stands.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Well, no...\n              (clears his throat)\n          I wanted to thank you all for\n          giving me such a nice welcome, and\n          making me feel at home.  But I...\n          we're... actually here on business\n          of a sort...\n\nDALEY THORNHILL, 30s, the council parliamentarian, pipes up. \nHe's waving a copy of \"Roberts Rules of Order.\"\n\n                    DALEY\n          Point of order, Mr. Mayor, this\n          comes under the heading \"New\n          Business,\" and this is not the\n          time...\n\n                    ERNIE\n          I think we can make an exception\n          here, Daley.\n\n                    DALEY\n          It'll need to be moved and\n          seconded.\n\nErnie rolls his eyes, then quickly and mechanically, without\ninflection:\n\n                    ERNIE\n          All right, motion to hear the\n          speaker out of order.\n\n                    WYATT\n          Seconded.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Motion on the floor, discussion\n          open, discussion closed, all those\n          in favor signify by saying \"aye.\"\n\n                    ALL\n          Aye.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Opposed?

Ernie turns to Luke and smiles.\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Go ahead, son.\n\n                    LUKE\n          Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short\n          and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot\n          of repairs, and the truth of the\n          matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad\n          and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old\n          Tim, we can't possible afford them\n          all.  So, I'd like to ask your help\n          to... well, to scrounge around a\n          bit, and see if you have anything\n          that might help us out.\n\n                    WYATT\n          What kinds of things are you\n          talking about?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light\n          bulbs, yardage, and if you can't\n          come up with any of that, we can\n          use some old-fashioned elbow\n          grease.\n\nFitts leans forward.\n\n                    FITTS\n          So... you do intend to fix the\n          place up after all?\n\n                    LUKE\n          Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I\n          think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit\n          more than it needs a super market. \n          And I think Lawson deserves the\n          Bijou.  There's not a lot that can\n          be done to help us get past the\n          pain we've all felt...\n\nHe looks at Harry and smiles.\n\n                    LUKE\n          ... but I think a good dose of\n          magic is as good a place as any to\n          start.\n\nThe council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then:\n\n                    WYATT\n              (eagerly)\n          Motion to encourage the citizenry\n          of Lawson to help out the Bijou in\n          any way they can...\n\n                    DALEY\n              (a subtle reminder)\n          ... short of the allocation of city\n          funds...\n\n                    WYATT\n              (agreeing)\n          ... short of allocation of city\n          funds.\n\n                    DALEY\n              (enthusiastically)\n          Seconded!\n\n                    ERNIE\n              (brightly)\n          Motion on the floor, discussion\n          open, discussion closed, all those\n          in favor signify by saying \"aye.\"\n\n                    ALL\n          AYE!\n\n                    ERNIE\n          Hearing no opposition, the motion\n          is carried!

CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - DAY\n\nAs the entire city council and the Bijou trio looks on, Luke\nmoves to the memorial and pulls down the huge piece of muslin\ncovering it.  Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in\nhis arms.\n\nErnie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument.\n\nErnie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the\nbase of the monument.\n\n                    ERNIE\n              (slowly)\n          You know, this really ought to be\n          out where people can see it.\n\nLuke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to\nHarry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the\nmuslin taut between his outstretched arms...\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\nMONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER...\n\nANGLE - THE SCREEN\n\nHarry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old\nscreen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke\nand Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS,\nwatching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe.\n\nHarry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen\ndrops down on Luke's head.  Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He\nraises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who\nscream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh.\n\nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\nOld Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the\naisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten\ncarpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris.\n\nThe men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just\nas they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to\nHarry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later,\nsomeone else grabs Old Tim's end.\n\nBOB LEFFERT\n\nhas a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his\nhook.  He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow.\n\nLuke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY\n\nHarry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery\nWyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies\nand scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.  Then,\nas Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and\nMrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall\npaint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work\npainting.\n\nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY\n\nLuke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool\nbox nearby.  He's just straightened out the \"J\" and he steps\nback... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first\ntime in a long time, the sign actually reads, \"THE BIJOU.\"\n\nBut not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts\nshaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke\nlunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. \nOnce again, the sign reads, \" HE B J U.\"  Luke winces.\n\nEXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY\n\nErnie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a\nsmall group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it\ntakes shape in a prominent place in the square...\n\nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY\n\nHarry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to\na corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila --\nnew screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge,\nstanding below, applaud enthusiastically.\n\nINT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY\n\nAs work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just\nfinished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover\nand trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits,\ncloses her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude\nNo. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a\nbit out of tune, it's still beautiful.\n\nAs she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before\nlong, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. \nTransported.\n\nAfter a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. \nSurprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows.\n\n                    LUKE\n          That was beautiful.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          I taught you that.\n\n                    LUKE\n          I can play the piano?\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n              (all fluttery)\n          Oh dear, yes.  You were an\n          excellent student, before all that\n          clarinet nonsense.  You loved\n          Chopin.  You used to call it\n          \"heaven music.\"  \"Teach me some\n          heaven music,\" you used to say.\n\nShe sits at the piano.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          Sit.  Play with me.\n\n                    LUKE\n          No, I...\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          Some of it might come back to you.\n\nReluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to\nplay a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          That's good... that's good...\n\nBut it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just\nplunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures\nhe's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's\ntransformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie\nwoogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          Really, Luke!  That's no way to\n          treat Mr. Chopin!\n\nShe stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning\nmadly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs\nover and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top\nhalf to Luke's bass line.\n\nOLD TIM\n\nis tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says:\n\n                    OLD TIM\n          I taught him that.\n\nOff Adele cracking up.\n\nTHE MONTAGE CONTINUES...\n\nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY\n\nLuke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his\nwatch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train\ngoes by.  This time, however, only the \"J\" tips over at a\njaunty angle.  Luke smiles.\n\nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY\n\nLuke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter,\ndevouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed\npotatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically\nwhite from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are\nstained with paint specks.\n\nAt the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably\nwith Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to\nrefill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back\nto the newspaper he's reading.\n\nINSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN\n\nProminent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a\npoliceman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying\nheadline:\n\n               BOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S\n               JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH\n                Hollywood Writer Feared Dead\n                 Were Red Agents Involved?\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT\n\nLuke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below\non the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a\nswitch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the\nswitch...\n\n... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel\nthe rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle\nand shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele,\nHarry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted,\nLuke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY\n\nON THE MEMORIAL\n\nComplete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the\nsquare.\n\nWIDER\n\nIt's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. \nMayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks,\nthen picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost\nlives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head.\n\nON THE CROWD\n\nOne-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly\nheld aloft by their loved ones.\n\nLuke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out\nat the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. \nLuke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform...\n\nLUKE'S POV\n\nIt's Bob Leffert, standing with Mabel, looking very sharp in\nhis dress greens.  He brings his hook-hand up and salutes\nsmartly.  Mabel takes his good hand, squeezes it as she\nblinks back tears.\n\nLuke smiles at this scene as Harry wipes his eyes and puts\nhis arm around Luke's shoulder, pulls him close and kisses\nhim on the forehead.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE SAME - LATER\n\nThe Lawson High School Marching Band is set up on the steps\nof City Hall, playing the \"Star Spangled Banner.\"  They are\nbeing conducted by their director, MR. PHILLIPS.  Luke and\nHarry, hands over their hearts, watch and sing along.  Then,\nLuke takes a closer look at the DRUM MAJOR...\n\nON THE DRUM MAJOR,\n\na tall young man wearing an ornate brocaded red and white\nuniform with \"LHS\" emblazoned across the chest.\n\nON LUKE\n\nHe has an idea.  The anthem ends, and Luke excuses himself\nand moves forward, buttonholing Mr. Phillips as he comes down\nthe steps...\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  BIJOU - DAY\n\nLuke and Adele are on ladders, hanging letters on the\nmarquee, which reads:\n\n                 GRAND RE-OPENING TONIGHT!\n                         GENE KELLY\n                    AN AMERICAN IN PARIS\n\nHarry comes outside and gets their attention.  Grandly, he\ngestures toward the door, and out strides\n\nOLD TIM,\n\nwearing his new uniform -- it's the Lawson High School drum\nmajor's uniform, modified here and there.  \"B-I-J-O-U\" is\nproudly emblazoned across his chest in gold brocaded letters.\n\nLuke and Adele applaud.  Old Time looks up at them -- AND\nSMILES!\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nOld Tim stands at attention, clutching the front door handle. \nMrs. Terwilliger, wearing a new dress, her hair newly and\nperfectly coiffed, stands at the ready at her candy counter,\nready to sell tickets and refreshments.\n\nHarry and Luke nervously pace the lobby.  Luke checks his\nwatch.  It's time.  He shakes Harry's hand, and nods to Old\nTim, who swings the door open...\n\nON THE DOOR\n\nImmediately, PATRONS come flooding into the theater.  Luke\nexchanges surprised glances with Harry -- then walks outside.\n\nOUTSIDE THE THEATER\n\nLuke comes out and looks down the block.\n\nHIS POV\n\nThe line of PATRONS stretches two deep down the block and\naround the corner.\n\nLuke smiles.  Success.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- \"FRED ASTAIRE - ROYAL WEDDING\"\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY\n\nLuke's selling tickets from behind the candy counter while\nMrs. Terwilliger sells refreshments to a line of CUSTOMERS. \nLuke sells a ticket to a WOMAN, who moves away, revealing\n\nBOB LEFFERT AND MABEL.\n\nLuke smiles at Bob, who smiles back, his eyes now fairly\ndancing with life.  He plunks down his admission, and Luke\nhands him two tickets, which he takes with his hook-hand. \nMabel smiles at Luke, takes Bob's good hand, and they move\naway, revealing A FARMER AND HIS WIFE, 50s.\n\nThe Farmer steps up and holds out a plucked chicken by its\nneck.\n\nLuke, surprised, jumps back -- then smiles, pulls off two\ntickets, and exchanges them for the chicken.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- \"THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL\"\n\nINT.  BEHIND THE SCREEN - NIGHT\n\nThe only light back here is the light of the movie, spilling\nthrough the screen.  Luke is straightening up the backstage\nstorage area, when Adele taps him on the shoulder.  He turns,\nand she throws her arms around his neck and kisses him.  She\nhands him a paper to read.\n\nON THE PAPER\n\nLuke angles it so he can read it by the light of the screen. \nIt says:\n\n              California State Bar Association\n                    ADELE LOUISE LARDNER\n            has PASSED the State Bar examination.\n\nLuke, thrilled, grabs Adele and picks her up, twirling her\naround with joy.  He sets her down and kisses her\npassionately.\n\n                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n\nTHE BIJOU'S MARQUEE -- \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\"\n\nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nHarry is frantically threading the changeover projector.  The\nbell on the running projector DINGS! once, signalling that\nthe reel is coming to an end.  Harry looks out the window at\nthe screen, then back to the task at hand.\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nLuke comes out of the office carrying a folded movie poster. \nWith a satisfied smile, he walks through the lobby, admiring\nhow handsome the old place looks.  Old Tim, snappily attired\nin his uniform, is sweeping a tiny pile of debris into a\ndustpan.  Mrs. Terwilliger is straightening up the candy\ncounter.  All is well.\n\nLuke goes to the lobby's poster case.  He opens it, and\nunfolds a brand-new one-sheet poster for \"SAND PIRATES\" --\nthe same design as the one-sheet we saw in Pete's apartment. \nMethodically, he thumbtacks the poster up and closes the\ncase.\n\nAs Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the\ntheater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays\nopen for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch\na bit of the picture.\n\nINT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\nON THE SCREEN - \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\"\n\nThe second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's\nprogrammer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon\nhangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. \nGREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is\nengaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain.\n\nPete takes a seat on the aisle near the door.\n\n                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)\n          You don't think you can win this,\n          do you?\n\nKhalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (ala \"Khalid\")\n          \"Ha!  I'd say I was winning!\"\n\n                    KHALID (ONSCREEN)\n          Ha!  I'd say I was winning!\n\nLuke's look is \"How did I know he was gonna say that?\"\n\nOnscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory.\n\n                    LUKE\n          \"Gregory!  Look out!\"\n\n                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)\n          Gregory!  Look out!\n\nPete did it again.\n\nOnscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly\ndispatches Khalid.  He stands over the body, catches his\nbreath and says:\n\n                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)\n          It's all right, Rebecca.\n\n                    WOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN)\n          Is he dead?\n\n                    GREGORY (ONSCREEN)\n          Yes, Rebecca.  He's dead.\n\nREBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and\ntakes our attention because she's being played by Sandra\nSinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend...\n\nON LUKE\n\nHis mouth is gaping open.  He stares at the screen.\n\n                    LUKE\n              (a whisper)\n          Sandra...?\n\nLuke stands.  Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the\nlobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his\npopcorn and the door closes.\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nLuke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.  Old Tim and\nMrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior.\n\n                    MRS. TERWILLIGER\n          Luke?  Dear, are you all right?\n\nWithout answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case.\n\nON THE POSTER - \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\"\n\nForget the cheesy B-movie artwork.  As Luke looks at the\nposter, it's clear that he's remembering something.  He looks\nat the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits\nblock at the bottom of the poster.  His eyes lock upon\n\n                 WRITTEN BY PETER APPLETON\n\n                    LUKE\n          My god... my god... no...\n\nSuddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing\ndown on him...\n\n... because he remembers...\n\nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT\n\nThe warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's\ncarbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying.\n\n                    HARRY\n              (pleading)\n          Oh, baby, make your daddy happy...\n\nHarry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous\nreel is about to end.  Given no other choice, he finally\ngives the changeover projector a good swift kick.\n\nIt hums to life.  A perfect changeover.  Harry pets the\nprojector.\n\n                    HARRY\n          You're a good girl.  No matter what\n          I say.\n\nAs he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left\narm.  Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a\nchair, and sits heavily.\n\nHe tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a\nhacking, choking COUGH.  He tries to stand, but drops to his\nknees, clutching his left arm harder than before.\n\n                    HARRY\n              (in pain)\n          Oh, Jesus...\n\nHarry falls to the floor, and as he does\n\nTHE FILM\n\nbreaks in the projector gate... flap!  flap!  flap!...\n\nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT\n\nLuke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought. \nOffscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in\nreaction to the broken film.\n\nMrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't\ncome out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and\nspins him around...\n\n                    OLD TIM\n          Mr. Luke!\n\nLuke stares wide-eyed at the old man.\n\n                    MRS.

He gets out, and an big old German\nShepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed.\n\nRory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the\nlock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank\nand sniffing the air expectantly.\n\n                    RORY\n          Whatsit, girl?\n\nHe stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.

Suddenly, a large black car punches out\nof the fog bank and tears down the road.  It's followed by\nanother, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and\ntrucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town.\n\nRory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly\npast the station.\n\n                    RORY\n          Shhhhh.

He speaks slowly -- he's\nmaking this up and thinking it out as he goes.\n\n                    PETE\n          Mr. Chairman... there's... another\n          Amendment... that I'd like to\n          invoke at this time, but it's not\n          the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if\n          you're familiar with it.\n\n                    DOYLE\n          Mr. Appleton, you will...\n\nHe opens the book and reads, tentatively at first.\n\n                    PETE\n          \"Congress shall make no law\n          respecting an establishment of\n          religion, or prohibiting the free\n          exercise thereof; or abridging the\n          freedom of speech, or of the press;\n          or the right of the people\n          peaceably to assemble, and to\n          petition the Government for a\n          redress of grievances.\"\n\nPause.  Silence in the room.\n\nADELE\n\nShe's smiling at the TV.  Her eyes are filled with tears.\n\nPETE\n\nHe looks up at Chairman Doyle.  Now fully confident.\n\n                    PETE\n          That's the First Amendment, Mr.\n          Chairman.  It's the backbone of\n          this nation.  It's everything that\n          gives us the potential to be right\n          and good and just -- if only we'd\n          live up to that potential.  It's\n          what gives me the right to sit in\n          this chair and say my piece before\n          this committee without fear.  It's\n          the most important part of the\n          contract that every citizen has\n          with this country.  And even though\n          this contract...\n              (he holds up the book)\n          ... the Constitution and the Bill\n          of Rights -- even though they're\n          just pieces of paper with\n          signatures on them -- they're the\n          only contracts we have that are\n          most definitely not subject to\n          renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr.\n          Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde,\n          not by any member of this committee\n          -- or anyone else -- ever.\n\nPin-drop silence in the room.  Pete scans the faces of the\npanel.  All betray anger.\n\nON LEO\n\nHe can't help but smile and nod appreciatively.\n\n                    PETE\n          And when you get right down to it,\n          that's really all I have to say to\n          this committee.  Good morning.\n\nAnd with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared\nstatement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and\nwalks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and\nFLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel\ninsistently.\n\n                    DOYLE\n          The witness will resume his seat! \n          Did you hear me?!
