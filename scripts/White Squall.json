LATE MODEL CAR - SAME\n</b>\nCHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind\nthe wheel.  He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street\nthat leads to the wharf.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          I never got close to him, nobody\n          did.  But by the time we made Tampa,\n          I was sure I knew who he was, that I\n          understood what he saw, what\n          nourished his soul and tested his\n          faith...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  WHARF - DAY\n</b>\nChuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, the\nechoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping.\nThe small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their\nmoorings.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          He had taken us to worship, where,\n          what was for him, the holiest of\n          holies.  And, for us too by the\n          end...\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER\n</b>\nChuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of\npeople.  They surround a small building, a neighborhood\nclinic.  A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates\nthe structure.\n\n<b>         IN MEMORY OF NATALIE \"ALICE\" SHELDRAKE M.D.,\n</b><b>          CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE\n</b><b>             BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961\n</b>\nNext to the stone a funeral urn.

The afternoon wind is coming up with the\ntide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting,\ndrawn, lost.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          Though he had moved on with his\n          life, now even for the years, to\n          hear him eulogized by strangers,\n          seemed strange.  He had been a\n          hewner of stones, a pilot by the\n          silent stars.  Like me, alone among\n          many.  But most of all for us, the\n          crew of the brigantine Albatross, he\n          was always and would forever be...\n          our Skipper.\n\nA SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  A\nbeautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips\ninto port.  A picture out of another time, another place.\nIt takes him away...\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.

A single ladder runs up\nto the top.\n\n<b>AT THE TOP\n</b>\nJust above the tree tops, the view is spectacular.  CHUCK\nGIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady.  Chuck's gaze is drawn\nupward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds.  Chuck's\nolder brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself\nto the top.\n\n<b>                         WILL\n</b>          You gonna jump?

Will considers him, troubled.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          I'm just not like you.  Ya know?\n          I'm never going to go to Yale.

The sky\nrumbles.  Distant thunder.\n\n<b>                         WILL\n</b>          We better go.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  GIEG HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\nMaple street, USA, tree lined and quaint.  The Gieg home\nis a modest two story house with a covered porch.  The\nfamily station wagon is poised for departure.  CHARLES,\n45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother,\n40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house.  Chuck and Will\nappear from the woods.\n\n<b>                         CHARLES\n</b>                  (ticked)\n          You plan on making this plane or\n          not?\n\n<b>                         WILL\n</b>          Don't take any wooden nickels\n          Kemosabe.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          I won't.\n\nWill shoves out a hand at Chuck.\n\n<b>                         WILL\n</b>          And lighten up will ya.\n\nChuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side.\nCharles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big\nfavor.\n\n\n<b>INT.

Okay?\n\nCharles regards him oddly.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  AIRPORT GATE - DAY\n</b>\nThe National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything\nChuck has ever seen.  Passengers begin boarding.

They shake.  Then Chuck hurries\naway into the crowd.  Charles and Middy watch until he is\nout of sight.\n\n\n<b>INT.  PLANE - DAY\n</b>\nChuck settles into his seat next to the window.  He\nwatches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the\n<b>707.\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  AIRPORT CUSTOMS - BERMUDA - DAY\n</b>\nAnother world.  Chuck stands in line at the customs booth.\nHe cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and\ncoral reefs beyond the runway.\n\nThree other boys are ahead of him in line.  The CUSTOMS\nAGENTS go through every piece of luggage.  TOD JOHNSTONE,\n16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of\nthe agents about his spear gun.\n\nRICK MARCH, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his\nhead, smiling.  He spots Chuck, moves through the line and\nshoves out a hand.\n\n<b>                         RICK\n</b>          Albatross?\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Yeah.\n\n<b>                         RICK\n</b>          Rick March.

Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on\nthe back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking\ngiant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's\nEnglish professor.\n\nPuffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at\nTod and the others.

MAIN CABIN - DAY\n</b>\nChuck makes his way down the companionway into the main\ncabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking.\n\nThe sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of\nbunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the\nroom is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat\nand study.\n\n<b>                         RICK\n</b>          Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg.\n\nAmong the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub\nwith soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and\nrodent-like.\n\nRobin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10\nphoto of a young man in a football uniform.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          I'm Robin.\n\nChuck regards the photo.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>                  (flat)\n          That's my brother.  He's dead.\n\nApprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk.\nRobin tacks up the picture above his bunk.  Terry unpacks\nin front of one of the lower berths.\n\nA loud \"THUD!\" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies\nat the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing\nfigure climbs into the cabin.\n\nThis is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.\nHis hair is slicked back \"Dean\" style and wears a full\nday's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the\nothers, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path.\nHe stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)\nand drops his bag.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          I'll take this one.\n\n<b>                         TERRY\n</b>          You probably didn't notice, but this\n          bunk has been taken.\n\nJohn just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things\nonto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it\ninto the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches,\nintimidated.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          Anybody gotta problem with that?\n\n<b>                         RICK\n</b>                  (beat)\n          Absolutely not.\n\nJohn climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.  Bill\nenters, followed by several adults.\n\nDR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is\nship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.  Lawford appears with\nGEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Alright, listen up.

A sound stops the laughter.  Almost on cue, the\nsound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above\nthem.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking\nthe light.  Ominous.  They all notice and look up.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>                  (mysterious)\n          You'll meet him.  Soon enough.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE\n</b>\nDawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.  The\nonly sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber.\nSuddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD (O.S.)\n</b>          Arise, Arise, Arise...\n\nChuck wakes, disoriented.  Terry bolts upright and hits\nhis head on the low ceiling.  Ouch.\n\nTod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.  Lawford's voice\nechoes through the ship.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD (O.S.)\n</b>          Exultation is the going/ Of an\n          inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/\n          Past the headlands/ Into deep\n          Eternity/ Bred as we, among the\n          mountains/ Can the sailor\n          understand/ the divine intoxication/\n          of the first league out from land?\n                  (pause)\n          But I suppose we'll answer that\n          question soon enough gentlemen.\n          Soon enough.\n\n<b>                         TERRY\n</b>          What question?\n\nChuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swings\nhis feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.\nJohn rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>                  (foggy)\n          What the hell is going on?\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Maybe it's an air raid.\n\nIn crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps\nthrough the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistle\nand blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab their\nears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his head\nagain.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Roll out sailors!  All hands on\n          deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty\n          seconds.\n\nHe blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even John\nto his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Bill\nlooks up and casually notices him.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          You gotta problem Goodall?\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          You blow that thing again I'll shove\n          it so far up your ass, you're gonna\n          need dental floss to get it out.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Just get on deck.\n\nBill turns and disappears topside.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Single file.\n\nThe crew lines up.

Go,\n          Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,\n          stay you pay!!\n\nRick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by\nTod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit the\nwater.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John stands\ndefiantly with his arms folded.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Now what's the problem, Goodall?\n          Everybody swims.\n\nThe crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in the\nopen galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon is\nintoxicating.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          I don't.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          You will if you wanna eat.  Right\n          George?\n\nGeorge nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew stand\nshivering, waiting on John.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>                  (to Bill)\n          You gonna swim for your breakfast?\n\nBill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts,\nswings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard\narm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet\nbelow.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away.\n\nLawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          \"Down, down beneath the deep, That\n          oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a\n          sound and peaceful sleep, With the\n          salt waves dashing over him.\" --\n          Lord Byron gentlemen.\n\nWith that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge\nKERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself\nup and gets in John's face.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in\n          twice.  So I guess I'll be eating\n          your breakfast too.\n\nJohn considers him, then strips off his shirt.  But\ninstead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into\nthe ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.\n\nHe manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of\nratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard\narm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest and\neverybody knows it.\n\n<b>                         MIKE\n</b>          I got five bucks says he doesn't.\n\n<b>                         CHRIS\n</b>          I got five that says he doesn't\n          live.\n\n<b>                         TOD\n</b>          I'll take a dollar of that.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          This is crazy!\n\nRobin refuses to watch.  The others share a look.\n\nJohn makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the\nend of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but with\nno way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyone\ngasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive.\nFalling, falling, falling...\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Jesus.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          I can't watch this.\n\nJohn hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to the\nside waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, he\nbreaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow,\nto claim victory.\n\nSuddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared\nsilently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing\ndown at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to\nsee him.\n\nRICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept,\ncasually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and\nglides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed\nfrom the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command\nlike a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be\nreckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of\nsomeone larger than life.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Skipper on deck!\n\nThe crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazes\nright through them.\n\nHe looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits until\nthe silence is filled with everyone's attention.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          You know what's out there?  Wind and\n          wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools\n          that'll hold a sailing ship for\n          weeks and then spit her out into the\n          eye of the kind of hurricane.  A\n          blow that could knock the bridge off\n          a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and\n          sandbars that'll tear the belly from\n          her and enough fog and night to hide\n          it all.\n\nHe spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throw\nglances to the horizon.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          So look out there... and explain to\n          me why any man in possession of any\n          sense at all, would take on the sea\n          with sail?\n\nSkipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a fire\nin his eyes.  Nobody dare answers.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Because there's something else out\n          there.  It beckons in the wind and\n          sings in the shrouds.  Voices.\n          Whispering...\n\nHis ear to the wind.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men\n          you don't even know.  Men you can't\n          even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,\n          that part of you and I that aches to\n          be alive, that was banished by\n          everything we've ever been taught or\n          told.  It's a part of us that can\n          only be found on mountain tops and\n          deserts, in the deepest caverns,\n          smoking battle fields and... across\n          oceans.\n\nHe turns back to the sea, dark.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Out there, is where it all waits.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          He was everything I had expected,\n          part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.\n          He spoke in whispers and answered\n          all queries with efficiency and\n          directness.  He had gone to sea for\n          the first time at fifteen, the same\n          age as Bill Butler.  And as he\n          looked upon us that first day it\n          must have been as though he were\n          staring into a mirror.\n\nSkipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the\nchart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded to\nthe main mast and reads the inscription.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (reading)\n          \"Where we go one, we go all.\"\n\nWith that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This is\nexactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits\nthe fan.\n\n<b>                         TERRY\n</b>          This -- is gonna be a long eight\n          months.\n\n\n<b>INT.

Finally he looks up, startled.\n\n<b>                         TERRY\n</b>          I'm done.  I'm finished...\n\nHe scrambles to get up and clear his plate.  John sits\ndown without a word.  The others notice the two plates of\nfood.\n\n<b>                         RICK\n</b>          Hungry, Goodall?\n\nHe just grunts and starts eating.  Robin watches him.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          What's your problem?\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          Why'd you jump?\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          Because I felt like it.\n                  (sharp)\n          What do you care?\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>                  (aside)\n          I couldn't do it.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          Well, as soon as you grow some\n          balls, let me know.\n\nRobin bristles.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          Screw you!\n\n<b>                         CHARLIE\n</b>          He's right.

He guides another to the\nmidships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the\nhuge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the\nhalyard and hands it to Robin.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Take a turn under the pin and lead\n          it out to the others.  You guys in\n          the rear take up the slack.  Heave\n          together now...\n\nIn a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea\nchanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>                  (singing)\n          \"When the sun came up there was\n          whisky in the cup...\"\n\nThe more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the\nbeat.\n\n<b>                         BOYS\n</b>          \"When the sun came up there was\n          whisky in the cup...\"\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          Come on the rest of you, sing!

Skipper notices that\nthe work has stopped.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          What's wrong Mr. Lawford.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          It seems we're short on singers.\n\nSkipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer\n          gentlemen.  It lets everyone know\n          you're in sync.  It shows unity,\n          that all thoughts are one.  A crew\n          that sings together stays together.\n          Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and\n          be sailors.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>                  (in a whisper)\n          Everybody swims, everybody sings...\n          What's next?  Tap dancing?\n\nLawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down\nwith their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The\ncrew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great\nmainsail starts to rise.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          Tie it off!!\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (to Bill)\n          Outer.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Outer Jib!\n\n<b>                         CHARLIE\n</b>                  (confused)\n          Outta what?\n\nCoached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist\nthe jib.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (to Bill)\n          We'll bear off to port and run down\n          wind.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the\n          mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib\n          sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim\n          and Dick go aloft to unstop the\n          forecourse.  George will show you\n          what to do.  Tod, show your men the\n          forward pinrail and stand ready on\n          the buntlines and clewlines.\n          Forecourse first... work upward.\n\nThe newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George,\nJohn and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto\nthe footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion\neverywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing.\n\nLawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the\nothers move into their positions.  When Bill sees the\nyardarm crew is in place...\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Unstop the squares!\n\n<b>                         YARDARM CREW\n</b>          Unstop the squares!!\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (to Chuck)\n          Fall off to port.  Ease her around\n          to a heading of northeast.  Sing out\n          when you're there.\n\nAs the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into\na scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the\nsnapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the\nship heels and surges forward.\n\nBefore her awakening power, everyone changes their stance\nand grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the\nmainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines\nreleasing the stops on the other squaresails.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>                  (in a whisper)\n          Ah...

He self-consciously calls out.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Northeast sir!\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Unfurl the squares!\n\nTod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and\nthe great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending\na shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with\nthe added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and\nLawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's\nposition.\n\nChuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty\nof the canvas that the Albatross carries.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Raise the inner jib!

The power of the\n          wind!\n\nAs the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.\nEveryone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a\npowerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam\nsplashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through\nthe water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a\nmagical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Did we lose anybody?\n\n<b>                         ALICE\n</b>          Not yet.\n\n<b>LONG SHOT\n</b>\nThe Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful\nimage of another time.  And yet, here she is.\n\n<b>ON DECK\n</b>\nEach of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.\nMusic builds.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Chart us a course for the windward\n          side.\n\nAlice considers his request.\n\n<b>                         ALICE\n</b>          That low passed through last night.\n          May be a little bumpy out there.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          It's time these boys saw some real\n          blue water.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER\n</b>\nThe bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a\nfifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is\nfierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and\nsailing well.\n\nThe crew has never seen mountains of water like this.\nDisaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front\nof the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear\nlife.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands\neffortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains\nperfectly dry.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Well... now that I have your\n          undivided attention...

Maybe you take your mates with\n          you.  How'd you like to have to bet\n          on Terry here getting us home today?\n          Each one of you is responsible for\n          the rest.  \"Where we go one, we go\n          all\".

Suddenly, without warning, he\nbreaks for the rail and lets fly.\n\nPhil and Charlie are next.  Chris climbs through the\ncompanionway but doesn't make it to the side.  Spontaneous\nregurgitation.  Bill and Lawford jump up onto the wheel\nhousing to avoid being sprayed.

But after a moment he starts to laugh too.  It's\ninfectious, they crack each other up.  Then, in the middle\nof belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over\nthe side.\n\n\n<b>INT.

This is what the Albatross was born\nto do.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n</b>\nIt's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.  Pots\ncrash, books and personals go flying.

BOW - SAME\n</b>\nThe shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind.\nThe block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  No\none dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hang\nthere seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps for\nthe rail and grabs it.\n\n<b>                         ALICE\n</b><b>          NOOO!!!\n</b>\nSuddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John\nhigh off the deck and over the side.

Waves explode\nthrough the netting.  As Tod releases the halyard, John\nfalls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive.  Lawford\nand Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit.\n\nSkipper looks her over.  Relieved.  No broken bones.  Good\nwork.  But then this is what he expects.  He respects her\nand now, everyone can see why.  He looks at John sprawled\non the deck.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Be careful will ya?\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          What ever you say Cap...\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Let's get that storm jib up.\n\nSkipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the\nstern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          The storm lasted sixteen hours and\n          it set us all on equal footing.

As we\n          stood our watches we were equally\n          out of control of our situation,\n          regardless of our physical abilities\n          or social backgrounds.  And though\n          our real feelings lay hidden beneath\n          bravado and defiance, we were no\n          longer strangers.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - DAY\n</b>\nThe crew is cleaning up.

The guys at the stern let\ngo of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that\ninstant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears\nback into the sea.

DECK - DAY\n</b>\nThe wind is up and the seas are high.  The ship is under\nfull sail driving at top speed.  Foam sprays from the bow\nas it slices through the water -- what she was born to do.\nThe crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of\nthe performance.\n\nTod is at the wheel with Chris nearby.

Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and\nangry.  He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart\nhouse.\n\nAs Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and\nstretches against the powerful wind.\n\nPhil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the\nchart house and silently fires.  There is a wicked POP as\nthe spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed\nby a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.\n\n<b>                         TOD\n</b>          Jesus Christ!!

Even though it would leave\n          him at a disadvantage in battle,\n          he'd push 'em into the sea.

So you gotta ask\n          yourself if it might not be better\n          to just put 'em off before they sink\n          the whole thing.

Spontaneous cheers from the boys.\n\nAs the 'Big A' pulls to the dock, John and Tod run for the\ngunnel door and swing it open.  The girls flood the deck.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Good morning, ladies.\n\nThey chatter in Dutch and hurry aboard.  Like wall\nflowers, Robin, Phil and Chuck stand on top of the chart\nhouse watching utopia unfold before them.\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          What are we supposed to talk about?\n\n<b>                         PHIL\n</b>          You've gotta be kidding?\n\n<b>                         ROBIN\n</b>          But, they don't speak English.\n\n<b>                         PHIL\n</b>          There are some things that everybody\n          does in the same language.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Yeah, but how are you supposed to\n          make the first move?\n\n<b>                         PHIL\n</b>          Like this!\n\nPhil reaches up for a free line.

Robin and Chuck applaud.\nPhil takes a bow.  All hell is breaking loose.\n\nSkipper and Alice welcome aboard the headmaster, MS.\nBOYDE, 50's, dumpy but tough.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          A very enthusiastic welcome.\n\n<b>                         MS.

The voices trail away as the ship moves off.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          Curacao seemed out of a dream,\n          somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio\n          drew further and further away, it\n          was home that began to seem unreal,\n          drifting somewhere in the foggy\n          reaches of our memories.  And I knew\n          that each of us was falling in love.\n          But not only with these wonderful\n          women or the swaying palms and\n          porcelain beaches... We were falling\n          in love with the experience we were\n          sharing, and with who we were\n          becoming.\n\n\n<b>INT.

The crew slow-\ndance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to\nglow against their dark skin.\n\nMs. Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck\nand BREGITTA.  Their lips appear pasted together and she\ndoesn't like it.  Lawford sees what is about to happen and\nhands his slimy cigar to George who reacts.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          Hold this, will ya?\n\nLawford intercepts Ms. Boyde.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          Madam, I would consider it a\n          privilege if you would allow me to\n          take you on a tour of the dance\n          floor.\n\nMs. Boyde is so flattered, it is all she can do to extend\nher hand.

Why can't you just\n          leave me alone?\n\nFrancis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out\nof his chair.  Everyone and everything.  It's humiliating.\n\n<b>                         PEGGY\n</b>          Francis!!\n\nShe cradles Phil's red face.

There's something about him that\nstill makes her blush.\n\nSkipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates,\nlooking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the\nboys notice and exchange looks.\n\nLawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and\nsmoking cigars.\n\n<b>                         GEORGE\n</b>          If I didn't know better I'd say the\n          old man was acting almost halfway\n          human.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          He is halfway human.\n\nOne by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his\nbride.

Those not on watch are sprawled about\nthe boat, scraping and 'red-leading' or reading.  Chuck\nand Robin sit forward with John, studying.

There they blow!!\n          Dolphins off the bow!!!\n\nEveryone rushes to see.  Dolphins leaping out of the\nwater.  It's a magnificent game they play with ships.  The\ncrew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close\nenough to touch.\n\nIsolated, Phil watches.  Angry, cut off.  Chuck eyes him,\nworried.\n\nBill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick\ninto the water.  Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere.\nRick pets them as they swim back and forth.  Shear joy.\n\nPhil reaches for the spear gun.  Nobody notices as he\nloads and takes aim.\n\nSuddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around.  A large\nfemale dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam\nspraying from her blow hole.  She lets out an agonizing\nscream.  Phil holds her fast.\n\n<b>                         CHRIS\n</b>          Jesus Christ!\n\nThe crew can only watch, stunned.

We'll\n          bring her up with the davit.\n\nA dory is lowered with John and Bill inside.  Once near\nthe water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a\ncanvas harness.  The crew hoist her with the davit tackle,\nswing her inboard, and gently lower her to the deck.\n\nThey gather around the gasping animal.  Alice checks the\nwound.

Skipper grimly walks over to one of the\ndeck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds\nit out to Phil.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Finish it.\n\nPhil looks at the mallet, horrified.\n\n<b>                         PHIL\n</b>                  (stammering)\n          I'm not gonna kill it.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          You already have.  Now go on.  Do\n          it.\n\nPhil backs away.  Skipper stares at him for a moment, then\nwalks over to the dolphin.  Robin looks away.  The\nsickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the\nanimal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two\nthumps of her tail and, it's over.\n\nSkipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and\napproaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs\nthe spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the\npieces into the sea.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          What the hell is wrong with you?!\n\nPhil begins to shake with rage.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Come on.

Then the impulse passes.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          That's what I thought.\n                  (beat)\n          You're done.  You're going home.\n\nSkipper turns.  The humiliation is more than Phil can\ntake.  He lunges after Skipper.  Lawford grabs him.  Phil\nswings wildly.\n\n<b>                         PHIL\n</b>          You mean-assed bastard!!

And in the days that\n          followed the low morale was matched\n          only by a sense of arrogance that\n          perhaps the master should step down\n          and let his students take over.\n\n<b>AERIAL SHOT\n</b>\nRobin, the Albatross and the drama unfolding below spin\nslowly away as we climb, turning, higher and higher.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Remind them that\n          according to the Geneva Convention,\n          firing on a civilian vessel on the\n          high sea is an act of war.\n\nAnother exchange between George and the Cubans.  The crew\nlay flat on the deck, terrified.\n\n<b>                         GEORGE\n</b>          They say they are acting on the\n          direct authority of Fidel Castro.\n\nSkipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail.  The\nCuban Captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps\ninto the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels\naround pointing both barrels at the Albatross.  Skipper\nstands firm, between the shrouds.  Silence.  A standoff.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Tell 'em to come aboard.\n\nGeorge sends the return message.

Terry reluctantly joins his crew mates.  The\nCOMMANDING OFFICER faces Skipper as his men go down the\nline checking the passports.  Others search the ship.\n\n<b>                         COMMANDER\n</b>          Chicken is a fool's game captain.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          So is violating international law.\n\n<b>                         COMMANDER\n</b>          But you invited is aboard.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Your cannons made a compelling\n          argument.\n\nOne of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him\nforward.

The Cuban captain\nsmiles up at him.  Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in\nperfect Spanish.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Las estrellas es lo unico, que un\n          marinero verdadero se mesesita para\n          encontrarse.

He joins Alice at the helm.  They\nlinger for a moment.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          What'd he say?\n\nGeorge smiles, impressed as well.\n\n<b>                         GEORGE\n</b>          He told them real sailors need only\n          the stars.\n\nWith a new attitude, they turn to Skipper.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Alright then, let's get outta here.\n\nThe crew bolt to there positions.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          With staff and string he showed us\n          how to build a sextant.  As we rode\n          the trades, he shared the ancient\n          secrets of how to read the waves and\n          follow stars.  And some mornings\n          later, bathed in the orange glow of\n          a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea\n          like a phoenix.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ALBATROSS - PANAMA CANAL - DAY\n</b>\nPanama appears on the horizon.  The Albatross is dwarfed\nby the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves\nthrough the locks.  The crew stand on deck in quiet\nreverence.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well with\nthe world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A huge\nbearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a\ntrident in his hand.\n\nChuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the\nhorrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering\nbefore him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his\nmouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - NIGHT\n</b>\nThe Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship.\nWhere the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of\nthe crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow,\nsurreal.\n\nJohn's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick\nand Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears\nstart over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY\nJONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge\nwith the rest of the crew.\n\n<b>                         NEPTUNE\n</b>          Hold fast that polliwog and make him\n          presentable.\n\nChuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face\npowdered.\n\n<b>                         NEPTUNE\n</b>          Let it be known that on this day in\n          the year nineteen hundred and sixty-\n          one there appeared within the limits\n          of my royal kingdom, the sailing\n          ship brigantine Albatross, bound for\n          Galapagos.

Robin dressed like\na pig and crawls around snorting.\n\nJohn's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does\na rain dance.  Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet,\nhops around like a frog.  Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's\ngirlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is\ndressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck.\nFrenetic chaos.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - LATER\n</b>\nNeptune and his court lead a procession around the\nperimeter of the deck.

They shout\nlouder and louder, faster and faster until they have all\nworked themselves into a frenzy.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BOW - DAWN\n</b>\nDavey Jones, holds a large turtle shell over the crews\nheads.  As each one passes before him he pours blood from\nthe turtle shell onto their heads.  It runs down,\nstreaking their floured faces and necks.  As the ritual\nprogresses, Neptune speaks.\n\n<b>                         NEPTUNE\n</b>          By virtue of the power inherited by\n          me, I do hereby command all of my\n          subjects, such as mermaids, sea\n          serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks\n          and turtles, from eating, playing\n          with, or otherwise molesting this\n          vessel or her crew.

Ahead, glowing orange with the dawn, the islands of\nGalapagos.  It's desolate landscape of silent volcanoes\nand ancient lava flows that spill into the sea.\n\nThe faces of the boys, still streaked with the indignities\nof the night's ordeal, stand silently before their final\ndestination.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          We had journeyed over six thousand\n          miles to the very edge of the earth.\n          Like Darwin before us, we would\n          witness the bliss of nature in the\n          absence of man.  And it was as if\n          the Albatross had forded time,\n          leaving it behind.  In the heat of\n          those equatorial days, on the virgin\n          onyx beaches and shifting coral\n          dunes, one could expect to find\n          sunning iguanas, nesting frigates\n          and perchance... the footprints of\n          God.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SHIPWRECK BAY - DAY\n</b>\nThe Albatross rests at anchor.  On the beach, the crew\nwatch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the\nancient guano cliffs.  So unaccustomed are these creatures\nto man, that they have no fear.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

ALBATROSS - DAY\n</b>\nThe crew are sprawled across the deck taking final exams.\nAlice walks among them.  Chuck throws an anxious look\ntowards John who is buried in his test.\n\n\n<b>EXT.

Chuck and Robin watch as the iguanas\nsneak into unattended nests and steal eggs.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DUNES - DAY\n</b>\nChuck is alone gazing over the shoreline.  A huge flock of\nfinches darken the sky, circling the black sand beach.\nPure magic.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - DAY\n</b>\nBeyond, the anchored Albatross rocks and bounces in a\nblue-sky gale.  Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod\nstand by a dory watching the sea build.

It looks up,\nsensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's\ngrazing.\n\nTight.  Thundering bare feet on the black sand.\n\nThe goat looks up again, this time it sees five\nHomosapiens bearing down on him.  They come naked,\nswinging their shredded clothing above their heads like\nlassos.  Shouting, whooping, primal.  The goat bolts for\nits life.\n\nPounding through the waterline like the wild horses of\nSable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing.  The\ngoat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.\n\nThe beach is broad and long with no cover.  The hunters\nare gaining on the goat.  Splashing feet pound closer...\n\nSuddenly they are upon the goat.  But, instead of\nattacking it, they just run through it, passing it.  The\ngoat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked\nhumans run.\n\nClose on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step\nfor step.  The music builds as we...\n\n<b>FREEZE FRAME\n</b>\n\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n</b>\nWild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man.\nThe rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting.\nThe heaping of driftwood into piles.  Taught and powerful,\nthe glistening bodies of young men.\n\nBlue sparks leap from striking flint against stone.  A\nflame is born.  Voices howl in guttural triumph.\n\nAs the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of\nmen pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.\n\nThe goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance\nbuilds to a frenzy.  The night sky is filled with the\nbuilding sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting\nvoices.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME\n</b>\nThe wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water.\nThe flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning\nthe white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange.  The\nword A-L-B-A-T-R-O-S-S has been spelled in huge flaming\nletters.

MAIN CABIN - DAWN\n</b>\nThe crew sleep in their bunks.  Lawford's voice rumbles\ndown the companionway.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A\n          wind that follows fast, And fills\n          the white and rushing sail, And\n          bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise\n          you salty dogs.  The watch is on.\n\nChuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.  The dumb waiter\nclatters down from the galley with the morning's\nbreakfast.  Skipper and some of the crew are already\neating.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - DAY\n</b>\nThe Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage\nof what little wind there is.  The skies are gray and\ndank.  Tod and Terry are at the helm.  Chuck and John are\namid ship.

Thor's had his\n          fun.  Let's keep a keen eye.\n\nSkipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a\npowerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree\nlist to the starboard.  Skipper stops and turns.\n\nInstinctively, John and Chuck spring for the rigging to\ndrop sail.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (sharply)\n          No!

Skipper\nmaintains his vigil.\n\n<b>CLOSE ON WATER\n</b>\nFoam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like\nthe invisible footprint of a locomotive.  John sees it\nfirst.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>                  (shouting)\n<b>          HERE IT COMES!!!\n</b>\nEverybody turns and looks.

The wheel is\nnearly ripped out of Tod's hands.  Instinctively, he tries\nto turn the ship into the wind.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Hard to starboard!!!  Hard to\n          starboard!!!\n\nConfused, panicked, Tod keeps turning to the left, into\nthe wind.  Skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when\nthe ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the\ndeck.\n\n<b>                         TOD\n</b>          No, hard to port!\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b><b>          TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE\n</b><b>          RIGHT!!!\n</b>\nFinally, Tod does as he is told.  But as soon as the ship\nstarts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further\nonto her side.  As the deck becomes vertical Chuck half\nslips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n</b>\nRobin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table\nfinishing breakfast as the ship starts to go.  They all\nshare growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's\nmaximum angle.  Dishes start sliding off.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Get out!!  Everybody out!!\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - SAME\n</b>\nSkipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house\nand cuts the mainsheet with a single blow.  But it's too\nlate.  The tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails\nscoop tons of sea water, pinning the Albatross on her\nside.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME\n</b>\nAlice struggles towards the door.  The book case tears out\nof the wall and strikes her.  She drops to her knees.  The\ndoor swings open in front of her.  She reels for a moment\nand then loses consciousness.\n\n\n<b>INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME\n</b>\nLawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their\nbunks.  The world is suddenly sideways.  Lawford leaps up,\npushing the others towards the companionway ladder.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          GO, GO, GO!!!  TOPSIDE!!!  Come on\n          Charlie!  George, get them out!!\n\nGeorge disappears into the main cabin.  Lawford manages to\nget Charlie out.  As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder\nsea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back\ninto the bowels of the ship.\n\n\n<b>INT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n</b>\nRobin is through the companionway in the chart house with\nMike right behind him.  But instead of exiting, he holds\nthe door open against the sea so that Mike can escape.\n\nMike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it\nclosed, pinning Robin's arm.  He struggles to push\nthrough.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - SAME\n</b>\nJohn slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat\nwith his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged\nto the bottom.  He scrambles through the collapsed rigging\ntangled above him for the port lifeboat.\n\n<b>AT THE STERN\n</b>\nThe Albatross is going down.  Fast.  Chuck and Tod stand\non the after skylight.  Chuck catches glimpses of the\nstruggle going on below.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          My God, they're drowning!\n\nSkipper catches a glimpse of Alice through the skylight.\nWater washes over her but she doesn't move.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Oh please, no.  Not this woman.\n\n\n<b>INT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME\n</b>\nSkipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight.  His\nmuffled voice penetrates the cabin.  Alice stirs.  She\nlooks around, delirious.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Alice, get up!!  Come on girl!!\n\nHe pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the\nplanks, fingers bleeding.  Alice looks up confused but\ncalm and finds Skipper's eyes.\n\n<b>ON THE DECK\n</b>\nPanicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the\nax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of\nsplinters into the water.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Get out!!  Get out!!  Jesus Christ,\n          please God, Alice get out!!!\n\nBut after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip\nbeneath the sea.\n\n\n<b>INT.

We'll be right behind\n          you.\n\nBefore he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the\ntiny shaft.  Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser\nsmashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.  But the\npressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the\ngalley and out onto the deck.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  DECK - SAME\n</b>\nSkipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat\nbut sees that it is tangled in the rigging.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Johnny, it's not good.\n\nJohn defies him and keeps cutting.  The ship is almost\ncompletely submerged.\n\n<b>                         JOHN\n</b>          I can get it!\n\nSuddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges\ninto the water taking lines and rope with it.  John\nbecomes tangled and is dragged into the water.  Only his\nsuperior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and\nkeep cutting.\n\nThe Albatross slips beneath the surface.  Instead of\ntrying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat\nlines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea.\n\n\n<b>INT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME\n</b>\nEerie silence.  Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.\nDebris float around.  He begins to panic as the water\naround him rises.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!\n\nHe takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Then\nsuddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure\nwithin.\n\n<b>ON THE SURFACE\n</b>\nLawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the\nsurface.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  SURFACE - SAME\n</b>\nChuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house\ndoor as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the ship\nrolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up\nlike a huge dorsal fin.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  UNDERWATER - SAME\n</b>\nChuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still\nfinds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck just\ncan't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releases\nChuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chuck\nlooks up, startled.  The small round window in the door is\nilluminated from the cabin lights on the inside.\n\nThrough the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes.\nHe fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takes\na last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.\n\nHe meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange\nacceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robin\nhas refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  He\npresses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Then\nwith a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door,\ndisappearing into the darkness and eternity.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  SURFACE - SAME\n</b>\nChuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looks\naround, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells and\ndebris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind and\nrain on the water.\n\nSuddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of\nfoam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water\nlike shattered lances as the ship rights herself\nunderwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if\nin a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins\nto rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length\nexplodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.\n\n<b>ON THE DECK\n</b>\nLike Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of\ntangled line still slashing to free the remaining long\nboat.\n\nAnd for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as\nif this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Some\nof the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knows\nbetter.  She's filled to the gills with sea water.\n\nShe shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked\nto the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing,\nas she finally goes.\n\n<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n</b>\nSurvivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the\nwatery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The sea\nbecomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the\nwater.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b><b>          OH GOD!!!!!\n</b>\nHis scream echoes, for the grief of all.\n\n<b>ON THE SURFACE\n</b>\nThere is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips\nbeneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can only\nwatch.\n\nThen, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the\nsurface.\n\nSkipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means.\nJohn died cutting it free.\n\nTerry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs from\nBill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto\nthe side of the other freed life boat which has been\nswamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but\nalive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards the\nboat.\n\nSkipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for\nthose not accounted for.  But, they are gone.\n\nAmong the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The only\nsound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell,\nRobin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAY\n</b>\nThe boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper is\nin one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats has\nbeen rigged with sail.  Skipper stands in the bow staring\ninto the ink blue water.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north-\n          east.

She's gone.\n\nThere is something remarkably touching about this young\nman trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand on\nSkipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He pats\nBill's hand gently.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          Carry on.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          Yes sir.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          North, north-east.\n                  (beat)\n          And Dick, please make a note of our\n          final position.\n\nLawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating\nwreckage around them, silent, lost.\n\nSuddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  The\nsurvivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again.\n\nChuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's\nsuddenly alive... With sharks.\n\n<b>                         LAWFORD\n</b>          Hands and feet inside the boats.\n\nThey come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummaging\nthrough the debris.  They swarm around the boats until it\nseems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oar\nand starts beating wildly at the sharks.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b><b>          AAAAHHHH!!!!\n</b>\nThe others take up the cause and in a moment they are all\nscreaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of grief\nand anger.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          We slashed at the sharks as if\n          striking out at the finger of God.\n          And we all begged silently for the\n          ability to understand what had\n          happened.  But, if there was a God\n          that day, his answer came only in\n          the moaning wind and our questions\n          were left to drift unanswered, in\n          the titanic ocean of our deepest\n          grief.\n\nExhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>                  (hushed)\n          Wake up.

The wails of family members can be heard as\nthey see the list outside.  Flash bulbs and faces press\nagainst the windows shouting questions.  He just stares at\nthe floor.\n\n<b>OUTSIDE\n</b>\nFrom above we can see the group swarm around the the booth\nlike angry hornets.  The crew are fractured and pulled\napart from each other.

Make them\n          understand.\n\nThe room grows silent.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>                  (smiling)\n          You tell them Chuck.\n\nChuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          It's simple.  Bad things happen\n          sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or\n          Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in\n          this room.  Because we all knew the\n          risks.\n                  (to parents)\n          You sent us... You paid our tuition,\n          you allowed us to go.  So to invent\n          a reason for why this happened, to\n          pin it on one person, well that\n          won't change anything.  It'll just\n          make our experience meaningless.\n\nHe turns to the tribunal.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          If you want to judge this man, judge\n          him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice\n          and George.  Chris and John and\n          Robin.  In one way or another each\n          one of them gave their lives saving\n          one of us.  This may sound crazy but\n          the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or\n          even a school.  It was something\n          that we made, that's inside us.\n          That's who Skipper is.  That's what\n          he taught us.  I guess what it\n          really was about was... the\n          privilege of sacrifice.\n\nChuck turns to Skipper.\n\n<b>                         CHUCK\n</b>          Isn't that right?\n\nSkipper nods.\n\n<b>                         SKIPPER\n</b>          That's right.\n\nThe room is silent.  Then, a voice.  A golden tenor\nsinging like the wind.  Everyone turns.  It's Bill.\n\n<b>                         BILL\n</b>          When the sun came up, there was\n          whisky in the cup, and not a one of\n          us was sober...\n\nOne by one the crew members stand and begin to sing.\nChuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand\nwith him.  Words or not.\n\n<b>                         CREW TOGETHER\n</b>          Jenny thought she saw a picture when\n          it really was the sun, then we knew\n          the party was over.\n\nThey all stand facing Skipper and sing.  The voices build,\nsweeping over everyone like a wave.\n\n<b>                         CREW TOGETHER\n</b>          Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you\n          today, but I know we'll meet again,\n          when the moon is in the valley and\n          the leafs are on the trees, We will\n          come to clearly in the glen...\n\nSkipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Only\nnow is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swells\nlike an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small\nwooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in\nthe calm waters beyond.\n\nThe crew come together around Skipper one last time.  They\nembrace.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAY\n</b>\nOlder Chuck has returned to the small building where the\nfuneral services were held earlier.  The people have gone\nbut the funeral urn remains.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  PIER - DAY\n</b>\nChuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in his\nhands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins\nuntying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of\nhis office.\n\n<b>                         HARBOR MASTER\n</b>          What do you think you're doing.\n\nHe walks over to the dock.\n\n<b>                         HARBOR MASTER\n</b>          All right friend, out of the boat.\n\nHe tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the\nsharp end of a gaffing hook.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK\n</b>                  (softly)\n          Stand away.\n\nHe looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means\nbusiness.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raises\nthe sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as the\nsmall boat moves off for open water.\n\n\n<b>EXT.  OPEN SEA - SUNSET\n</b>\nBathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked\nagainst the ivory sail.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          They didn't take his ticket that\n          day.  But why he never returned to\n          the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he\n          hadn't been able to free himself\n          from the anchor of grief that had\n          driven him to his knees aboard the\n          Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared\n          for the solitude and isolation of\n          command without his Alice.  Or maybe\n          it was just that the waves that had\n          spoken to him for so long, had grown\n          silent.  Whatever it was, that\n          thing, it had always troubled me.\n          Because, fate offers up no reasons.\n          And maybe that's what I have\n          traveled these thirty four years to\n          say.  Maybe that is all I really\n          know... And, that one man cared.\n\nChuck turns to the sea and speaks.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK\n</b>          Rest easy old salt.  For together\n          again, we'll sail.\n\nWith a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at\nthe sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.\n\n<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\n</b>\nThe same sunset, but from another time.  Four young men\nwalk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached and\nrocks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look at\nit.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINE\n<b>ALBATROSS.\n</b>\nSLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,\nthe young men and the boat.\n\n<b>                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n</b>          Some time later we learned that one\n          of our long boats had been\n          recovered.  Several young men found\n          it washed up on a nameless beach\n          somewhere on the island of\n          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know\n          who they were or where they came\n          from, but they seemed to know of the\n          Albatross.\n                  (pause)\n          Sometimes in my dreams those\n          faceless young men reveal themselves\n          as my lost companions, and on the\n          twilight coral sands of forever,\n          between my slumber and conscious\n          state, we race naked again, so open\n          and in love with those precious\n          moments, running, ever laughing,\n          ever young, ever free.\n\n<b>                                            SLAM CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.
