Soaring gulls and sand pipers glide\nover the pilings and sagging bulkheads.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          Though I hadn't seen or spoken to\n          Sheldrake in over thirty years, it\n          seemed impossible that his heart was\n          the thing that had finally failed\n          him...\n\n\nINT.  LATE MODEL CAR - SAME\n\nCHUCK GIEG, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind\nthe wheel.  He pulls down a narrow cobble stone street\nthat leads to the wharf.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          I never got close to him, nobody\n          did.  But by the time we made Tampa,\n          I was sure I knew who he was, that I\n          understood what he saw, what\n          nourished his soul and tested his\n          faith...\n\n\nEXT.  WHARF - DAY\n\nChuck stares out across the harbor.  In the distance, the\nechoes of singing masts.  Shrouds and canvas softly ping.\nThe small boats of Mystic tug restlessly at their\nmoorings.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          He had taken us to worship, where,\n          what was for him, the holiest of\n          holies.  And, for us too by the\n          end...\n\n\nEXT.  DOCTORS OFFICE - LATER\n\nChuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of\npeople.  They surround a small building, a neighborhood\nclinic.  A worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates\nthe structure.\n\n         IN MEMORY OF NATALIE \"ALICE\" SHELDRAKE M.D.,\n          CAPTAIN'S WIFE AND SHIP'S SURGEON OF THE\n             BRIGANTINE ALBATROSS - MAY 2, 1961\n\nNext to the stone a funeral urn.  A YOUNG MINISTER gropes\nfor meaning.\n\n                         MINISTER\n          I didn't know Richard Sheldrake\n          personally, but his many friends who\n          knew and worked with him, wanted to\n          make sure that he was returned home,\n          here, to be remembered with his\n          beloved wife...\n\nChuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice\nfading away.  The afternoon wind is coming up with the\ntide.  He quietly heads towards the water.  Drifting,\ndrawn, lost.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          Though he had moved on with his\n          life, now even for the years, to\n          hear him eulogized by strangers,\n          seemed strange.  He had been a\n          hewner of stones, a pilot by the\n          silent stars.  Like me, alone among\n          many.  But most of all for us, the\n          crew of the brigantine Albatross, he\n          was always and would forever be...\n          our Skipper.\n\nA SHIP'S BELL turns him around.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  A\nbeautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips\ninto port.  A picture out of another time, another place.\nIt takes him away...\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  FOREST - WATER TOWER - DAY\n\nA towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and\nsycamores.  The tower is immense.  A single ladder runs up\nto the top.\n\nAT THE TOP\n\nJust above the tree tops, the view is spectacular.  CHUCK\nGIEG, 16, sits thin and unsteady.  Chuck's gaze is drawn\nupward -- to the building spring cumulus clouds.  Chuck's\nolder brother WILL, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself\nto the top.\n\n                         WILL\n          You gonna jump?  Or are you just\n          having a last look?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I was just thinking that I never had\n          a new pair of shoes till I was\n          twelve.\n\n                         WILL\n          It's no my fault I was born first.\n          Besides, nobody ever sent me on an\n          eight month vacation, so ease up on\n          the sad sack stuff.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          It's not a vacation, it's private\n          school.\n\n                         WILL\n          I thought this was your dream come\n          true.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          That's not why he's sending me.\n\n                         WILL\n          Why then.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Because it looks good.\n\nChuck looks out, yearning.  Will considers him, troubled.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I'm just not like you.  Ya know?\n          I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm\n          never going to be \"William\".\n\n                         WILL\n          Nobody says you have to be like me.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          He does.\n\n                         WILL\n          You don't give him enough credit\n          Chas.\n\nChuck takes a last look at the building clouds.  The sky\nrumbles.  Distant thunder.\n\n                         WILL\n          We better go.\n\n\nEXT.  GIEG HOUSE - DAY\n\nMaple street, USA, tree lined and quaint.  The Gieg home\nis a modest two story house with a covered porch.  The\nfamily station wagon is poised for departure.  CHARLES,\n45, a generally serious man broods as MIDDY, their mother,\n40, soft and thoughtful, exits the house.  Chuck and Will\nappear from the woods.\n\n                         CHARLES\n                  (ticked)\n          You plan on making this plane or\n          not?\n\n                         WILL\n          Don't take any wooden nickels\n          Kemosabe.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I won't.\n\nWill shoves out a hand at Chuck.\n\n                         WILL\n          And lighten up will ya.\n\nChuck hugs him anyway and walks to the passenger side.\nCharles tosses him the keys, like he's doing him a big\nfavor.\n\n\nINT.  CAR - DAY\n\nChuck sits in the drivers seat.  Middy is in the back.\nCharles slams the trunk and gets in.  Before Chuck turns\nthe ignition...\n\n                         CHARLES\n          Now just take it easy.  We're not\n          going to a fire.\n\nChuck reacts.\n\nOUTSIDE\n\nWill watches as the car pulls away.\n\nCAR - MOVING\n\nThe Giegs drive in silence.  Middy reads from a brochure.\n\n                         MIDDY\n          Honey, did you know that the\n          Albatross was captured by the\n          Germans during World War II?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          No, I didn't.\n\n                         MIDDY\n          It says she was originally Schooner\n          rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned\n          her into a brigantine.  I think\n          square rigs look so much more\n          romantic.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Me too.\n\n                         CHARLES\n          Appearances aren't everything.  Keep\n          your mind on the road.\n\nChuck pulls over to the side of the road.\n\n                         CHARLES\n          What are you doing?\n\nChuck hands him the keys.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I don't feel like driving.  Okay?\n\nCharles regards him oddly.\n\n\nEXT.  AIRPORT GATE - DAY\n\nThe National Airlines Boeing 707 is bigger than anything\nChuck has ever seen.  Passengers begin boarding.  Charles\nstands away, detached.\n\n                         MIDDY\n          Do you have your ticket?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes.\n\n                         MIDDY\n          Passport?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Look, I just better go.\n\nMiddy hugs her son.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.\n\n                         MIDDY\n          I know you will.\n\nChuck faces his dad.\n\n                         CHARLES\n          Make us proud.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes sir.\n\nCharles extends his hand.  They shake.  Then Chuck hurries\naway into the crowd.  Charles and Middy watch until he is\nout of sight.\n\n\nINT.  PLANE - DAY\n\nChuck settles into his seat next to the window.  He\nwatches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the\n707.\n\n\nEXT.  AIRPORT CUSTOMS - BERMUDA - DAY\n\nAnother world.  Chuck stands in line at the customs booth.\nHe cranes his neck to see the brilliant blue water and\ncoral reefs beyond the runway.\n\nThree other boys are ahead of him in line.  The CUSTOMS\nAGENTS go through every piece of luggage.  TOD JOHNSTONE,\n16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of\nthe agents about his spear gun.\n\nRICK MARCH, 17, wise-cracking and confident, shakes his\nhead, smiling.  He spots Chuck, moves through the line and\nshoves out a hand.\n\n                         RICK\n          Albatross?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yeah.\n\n                         RICK\n          Rick March.  Who the hell are you?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Gieg, Chuck.\n\n                         RICK\n          Look, meet us out front when you're\n          through.  If they try to take\n          anything away from you like Johnny\n          Quest up there, just make a list and\n          we'll have 'em send it down to the\n          boat.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Whatever.\n\nOne of the agent starts pulling things out of Rick's\nduffel bag.  He finds a dive knife.\n\n                         RICK\n          Hey, hey!!  That's my stuff!!\n\n\nEXT.  AUSTIN CAB - MOVING - DAY\n\nThe car whizzes through the narrow streets of Bermuda.\nCALYPSO MUSIC sings from the radio.  The streets are lined\nwith small coral houses and exotic palms.\n\n\nINT.  CAR - SAME\n\nThe boys are jammed inside with their things.  In addition\nto Chuck, Rick and Tod, is CHARLIE STRATTON, also sixteen.\n\n                         TOD\n          Well Ricky boy, spear gun or no,\n          it's sweet to be back in the world\n          of rum and honey.\n\n                         RICK\n          I gotta admit I never thought you'd\n          be back after the great \"Bowsprit\n          Affair\".\n\n                         TOD\n          Me and Skipper had a meeting of the\n          minds.\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          How's that?\n\n                         TOD\n          I begged.\n\n                         CHUCK\n                  (warming a little)\n          What the \"Bowsprit Affair\"?\n\n                         RICK\n          Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch\n          and managed to sweet talk one of the\n          local girls to have a go in the\n          bowsprit.\n\n                         TOD\n          Not just any 'local' girl.\n\n                         RICK\n          The 'local' mayor's 'local'\n          daughter.\n\nTod smiles, reminiscing.\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          Thing is, the net in the basket\n          isn't very comfortable, so Tod-o\n          wraps them up in the jib.

DOCK - DAY\n\nThe boys pile out of the taxi.  What seemed like a\npristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up\nclose.  The white paint is streaked and barnacles cover\nthe hull.  Looks of disappointment.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          What happened to it?\n\nA voice from behind turns Chuck.\n\n                         BILL\n          She cleans up.  We'll have her ship\n          shape before we shove off.\n\nThis is BILL BUTLER, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew\nand... first mate.  Bill gives Chuck a friendly slap on\nthe back and climbs aboard.  He is greeted by a Viking\ngiant of a man, LAWFORD, 37, and bearded, the ship's\nEnglish professor.\n\nPuffing on a huge Havana cigar, he stares coolly down at\nTod and the others.  He speaks with the voice of Moses.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          \"That this same child of honor and\n          renown, This gallant Hotspur, this\n          all praised knight, And your\n          unthought-of Harry chance to meet.\n          For every honor sitting on his helm,\n          Would they were multitudes, and on\n          my head.

MAIN CABIN - DAY\n\nChuck makes his way down the companionway into the main\ncabin.  Other crew members are already unpacking.\n\nThe sleeping arrangement is Pullman-style with two rows of\nbunks on each side of the cabin.  In the middle of the\nroom is a gimbaled table.  This is where the crew will eat\nand study.\n\n                         RICK\n          Listen up.  This is Chuck Gieg.\n\nAmong the crew -- feature ROBIN WEATHERS, 16, a cherub\nwith soft puffy cheeks and TERRY LAPCHICK, 17, skinny and\nrodent-like.\n\nRobin approaches with a hand extended.  He carries a 8x10\nphoto of a young man in a football uniform.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          I'm Robin.\n\nChuck regards the photo.\n\n                         ROBIN\n                  (flat)\n          That's my brother.  He's dead.\n\nApprehensively Chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk.\nRobin tacks up the picture above his bunk.  Terry unpacks\nin front of one of the lower berths.\n\nA loud \"THUD!\" turns everyone around.  A duffel bag lies\nat the bottom of the companionway.  A large imposing\nfigure climbs into the cabin.\n\nThis is JOHN GOODALL, 17, over six feet, big and broad.\nHis hair is slicked back \"Dean\" style and wears a full\nday's growth of bread on his face.  Compared to the\nothers, he looks all man.  Everybody clears from his path.\nHe stops in front of the lower, center bunk (Terry's bunk)\nand drops his bag.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I'll take this one.\n\n                         TERRY\n          You probably didn't notice, but this\n          bunk has been taken.\n\nJohn just glares at him, then dumps all of Terry's things\nonto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it\ninto the remaining upper berth.  Terry watches,\nintimidated.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Anybody gotta problem with that?\n\n                         RICK\n                  (beat)\n          Absolutely not.\n\nJohn climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes.  Bill\nenters, followed by several adults.\n\nDR. ALICE SHELDRAKE, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is\nship's surgeon and Skipper's wife.  Lawford appears with\nGEORGE PASCAL, 30's from Brazil, dark, and fit.\n\n                         BILL\n          Alright, listen up.  This is Dr.\n          Alice Sheldrake.\n\nThe guys stumble over only half listening.\n\n                         ALICE\n          I'm ship's surgeon.  I'm in charge\n          of aches, pains, biology, math and\n          science.\n\n                         BILL\n          George Pascal here is ship's cook.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          If you want to keep all your\n          fingers, stay the hell out of my\n          galley unless you're invited.\n\n                         BILL\n          Some of you already know Mr.\n          Lawford.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          I have been charged with the dubious\n          task of insuring your literary\n          education.\n\nLawford puts a hand on Bill's shoulder.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Bill Butler is your first mate.  But\n          don't let his size fool you.\n\nBill gives a half reluctant wave.\n\n                         MIKE\n          So when the hell do we get to meet\n          El Capitan?\n\nSnickering.\n\n                         TERRY\n                  (aside)\n          Maybe he's getting his wooden leg\n          waxed.\n\nLaughter.  A sound stops the laughter.  Almost on cue, the\nsound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above\nthem.  Then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking\nthe light.  Ominous.  They all notice and look up.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n                  (mysterious)\n          You'll meet him.  Soon enough.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SUNRISE\n\nDawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin.  The\nonly sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber.\nSuddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.\n\n                         LAWFORD (O.S.)\n          Arise, Arise, Arise...\n\nChuck wakes, disoriented.  Terry bolts upright and hits\nhis head on the low ceiling.  Ouch.\n\nTod, Rick and Charlie are up instantly.  Lawford's voice\nechoes through the ship.\n\n                         LAWFORD (O.S.)\n          Exultation is the going/ Of an\n          inland soul to sea/ Past the houses/\n          Past the headlands/ Into deep\n          Eternity/ Bred as we, among the\n          mountains/ Can the sailor\n          understand/ the divine intoxication/\n          of the first league out from land?\n                  (pause)\n          But I suppose we'll answer that\n          question soon enough gentlemen.\n          Soon enough.\n\n                         TERRY\n          What question?\n\nChuck tries to assimilate Lawford's words.  Robin swings\nhis feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look.\nJohn rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.\n\n                         ROBIN\n                  (foggy)\n          What the hell is going on?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Maybe it's an air raid.\n\nIn crisply pressed shorts and shirt, Bill Butler steps\nthrough the aft bulkhead.  He raises a bowswain's  whistle\nand blows.  OOOWWWEEEEOOO!!!!  Chuck and Robin grab their\nears.  It's a nightmare.  Terry jumps and hits his head\nagain.\n\n                         BILL\n          Roll out sailors!  All hands on\n          deck!  Sixty seconds.  Sixty\n          seconds.\n\nHe blows the whistle again.  This time it brings even John\nto his feet, staring down at Bill in a blind rage.  Bill\nlooks up and casually notices him.\n\n                         BILL\n          You gotta problem Goodall?\n\n                         JOHN\n          You blow that thing again I'll shove\n          it so far up your ass, you're gonna\n          need dental floss to get it out.\n\n                         BILL\n          Just get on deck.\n\nBill turns and disappears topside.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAWN\n\nThe sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew\nstaggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.\n\n                         BILL\n          Line up!  Single file.  Single file.\n\nThe crew lines up.  John is the last one through the hatch\nand he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.\n\n                         BILL\n          Everybody swims.\n\nThe boys are aghast.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Don't think people, just go!  Go,\n          Go, Go, Go, Go!!!  Swim you win,\n          stay you pay!!\n\nRick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by\nTod and Charlie.  They howl and scream as they hit the\nwater.  The rest follow like lemmings.  But John stands\ndefiantly with his arms folded.\n\n                         BILL\n          Now what's the problem, Goodall?\n          Everybody swims.\n\nThe crew are piling back on deck.  George stands in the\nopen galley door.  The smell of fresh bacon is\nintoxicating.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I don't.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          You will if you wanna eat.  Right\n          George?\n\nGeorge nods, wielding a butchers knife.  The crew stand\nshivering, waiting on John.\n\n                         JOHN\n                  (to Bill)\n          You gonna swim for your breakfast?\n\nBill gives John a long look then strips to his shorts,\nswings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard\narm.  He looks down at the water some twenty-five feet\nbelow.  It's a long way.  Robin turns away.\n\nLawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          \"Down, down beneath the deep, That\n          oft in triumph bore him, He sleeps a\n          sound and peaceful sleep, With the\n          salt waves dashing over him.\" --\n          Lord Byron gentlemen.\n\nWith that Bill leaps and hits the water with a huge\nKERSPLASH!  He swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself\nup and gets in John's face.\n\n                         BILL\n          Everybody swims.  Now, I've been in\n          twice.  So I guess I'll be eating\n          your breakfast too.\n\nJohn considers him, then strips off his shirt.  But\ninstead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into\nthe ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down.\n\nHe manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of\nratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard\narm -- the topgallant.  It's a pissing contest and\neverybody knows it.\n\n                         MIKE\n          I got five bucks says he doesn't.\n\n                         CHRIS\n          I got five that says he doesn't\n          live.\n\n                         TOD\n          I'll take a dollar of that.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          This is crazy!\n\nRobin refuses to watch.  The others share a look.\n\nJohn makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the\nend of the yard.  He tosses a look towards Bill but with\nno way to back down, he launches into the air.  Everyone\ngasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive.\nFalling, falling, falling...\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Jesus.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          I can't watch this.\n\nJohn hits the water like a bullet.  The crew run to the\nside waiting for him to come up.  Nothing.  Finally, he\nbreaks the surface.  Easy.  He climbs up waiting, somehow,\nto claim victory.\n\nSuddenly, they all feel it.  A presence.  He has appeared\nsilently on top of the Chart House, like a phantom gazing\ndown at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to\nsee him.\n\nRICHARD SHELDRAKE, (SKIPPER), ageless and windswept,\ncasually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and\nglides to the deck.  He is powerfully built and bronzed\nfrom the sea and sun.  He carriers the burden of command\nlike a cross.  Soft-spoken and remote, he is a man to be\nreckoned with.  The crew know they are in the presence of\nsomeone larger than life.\n\n                         BILL\n          Skipper on deck!\n\nThe crew line up clumsily.  Skipper has a gaze that blazes\nright through them.\n\nHe looks out to sea.  Searching, ominous.  He waits until\nthe silence is filled with everyone's attention.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You know what's out there?  Wind and\n          wave and rain.  Endless glassy pools\n          that'll hold a sailing ship for\n          weeks and then spit her out into the\n          eye of the kind of hurricane.  A\n          blow that could knock the bridge off\n          a battleship.  Reefs and rocks and\n          sandbars that'll tear the belly from\n          her and enough fog and night to hide\n          it all.\n\nHe spits into the water.  The crew sheepishly throw\nglances to the horizon.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          So look out there... and explain to\n          me why any man in possession of any\n          sense at all, would take on the sea\n          with sail?\n\nSkipper turns his gaze back to the boys.  There is a fire\nin his eyes.  Nobody dare answers.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Because there's something else out\n          there.  It beckons in the wind and\n          sings in the shrouds.  Voices.\n          Whispering...\n\nHis ear to the wind.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          They're voices of men.  Calling.  Men\n          you don't even know.  Men you can't\n          even imagine.  It's a seed, a wish,\n          that part of you and I that aches to\n          be alive, that was banished by\n          everything we've ever been taught or\n          told.  It's a part of us that can\n          only be found on mountain tops and\n          deserts, in the deepest caverns,\n          smoking battle fields and... across\n          oceans.\n\nHe turns back to the sea, dark.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Out there, is where it all waits.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          He was everything I had expected,\n          part Ahab part Queeg and even Bligh.\n          He spoke in whispers and answered\n          all queries with efficiency and\n          directness.  He had gone to sea for\n          the first time at fifteen, the same\n          age as Bill Butler.  And as he\n          looked upon us that first day it\n          must have been as though he were\n          staring into a mirror.\n\nSkipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the\nchart house.  He pats a small brass sign that is welded to\nthe main mast and reads the inscription.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (reading)\n          \"Where we go one, we go all.\"\n\nWith that, he disappears below.  Nobody moves.  This is\nexactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits\nthe fan.\n\n                         TERRY\n          This -- is gonna be a long eight\n          months.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - DAY\n\nThe boys devour a hearty breakfast.  Tod is the 'galley\nslave' and fills glasses with orange juice.\n\n                         TOD\n          Chow down boys.  The milk and eggs\n          are the first things to go once we\n          put out.\n\nJohn enters balancing two plates heaped with food.\n\n                         RICK\n          You know we gotta dumbwaiter for\n          that.\n\nJohn looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.\n\n                         RICK\n          Not that one.  Tod-o here.\n\nThe guys groan.\n\n                         TOD\n          Har, har, har...\n\nJohn approaches the full table, glaring down at Terry who\ndoesn't notice him.  Finally he looks up, startled.\n\n                         TERRY\n          I'm done.  I'm finished...\n\nHe scrambles to get up and clear his plate.  John sits\ndown without a word.  The others notice the two plates of\nfood.\n\n                         RICK\n          Hungry, Goodall?\n\nHe just grunts and starts eating.  Robin watches him.\n\n                         JOHN\n          What's your problem?\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Why'd you jump?\n\n                         JOHN\n          Because I felt like it.\n                  (sharp)\n          What do you care?\n\n                         ROBIN\n                  (aside)\n          I couldn't do it.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Well, as soon as you grow some\n          balls, let me know.\n\nRobin bristles.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Screw you!\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          He's right.  It was a stupid stunt.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Excuse me?\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          You heard me.\n\nJohn grabs Charlie by his private parts and hoists him\ninto the air.  Charlie gasps, the air sucked from his\nlungs.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Don't ever call me stupid.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Come on, he didn't mean anything.\n\nJohn shoves Robin to the floor with his free arm.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Let me tell you girls something.  I\n          do what I wanna do.  When I wanna do\n          it.  And I don't give a shit what\n          old Ahab up there thinks either.\n          Any questions?\n\nJohn releases Charlie who crumples to the floor.  John\nresumes eating.\n\nBill enters and reads the duty roster.\n\n                         BILL\n          Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg,\n          Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart:\n          scrape and paint.  Corry and\n          Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson,\n          you're the Galley slave.

You came back.\n\nJohn continues to eat.  When he realizes his name hasn't\nbeen called, he looks up to meet Bill's eyes.\n\n\nINT.  HEAD\n\nPissed, John tries to figure out the head.  Pumps going\nin, pumps going out.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          We were all thirteen individuals.\n          We'd arrived the sum total of our\n          limited experiences and the result\n          of our parents' best, if not narrow,\n          expectations...\n\nJohn pulls back on the lever, belching \"water de le\ntoilet\" all over him.\n\n\nEXT.  SHIP - DAY\n\nChuck sits in a bowswain's chair over the side, with a\npaint roller in his hand.  The rust-streaked hull is being\ntransformed.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          ... Some of us were there for\n          discipline, some for escape.  But I\n          could see a small piece of myself in\n          all of them and though I fought the\n          notion, for me, I knew now, this\n          would be home.\n\nA RADIO crackles in the b.g.\n\n                         ANNOUNCER\n          \"President Eisenhower today\n          acknowledged that a secret American\n          spy plane was in fact shot down over\n          the Soviet Union.

It\n          is said they embody the spirits of\n          sailors passed on.  It's very bad\n          luck if you kill one.  And dolphins\n          too.\n\nThe boys chuckle.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          I'm Francis Boutillier.  This is my\n          son, Philip.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          I know.\n\nFrancis looks the Skipper over, reading him, smiling.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You're a day late.

Promptness\n          is not a luxury, it's a necessity,\n          as is the work to maintain her.  Had\n          we been ready, I can assure you we\n          would have sailed.\n\nSomething in this exchange turns the tone of conversation.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          And I would have expected\n          compensation for my time and expense\n          coming all the way down here.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Happily, it all worked out...

This was\n          his mother's idea.  A romp through\n          the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds\n          more like a vacation than an\n          education if you ask me.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          It will be more than that, I can\n          promise you.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n                  (cool)\n          Take good care of my son.\n\nThere is threat in his tone.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          We'll do our best.

ALBATROSS - OPEN WATER - DAY\n\nThe Albatross is under full power.  There is a sense of\nexcitement and anticipation.  Charlie, Rick, Robin, and\nLawford are on the halyard for the mainsail.  Skipper is\nat the helm with Alice and Bill nearby.  Skipper calls\nover to Chuck who stands alone at the rail.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Come over here and take the wheel.\n\nChuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the\nwheel.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Hold her steady into the wind.\n          Southwest by west.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to all)\n          Gentleman, when you hear an order,\n          sing out.  I want to know that\n          you've heard and understand.\n                  (quietly to Bill)\n          Raise the mainsail.\n\n                         BILL\n                  (calling out)\n          Raise the main!\n\nLawford and his group bellow out.\n\n                         TOGETHER\n          Raise the main!!\n\nLawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the\nchart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy\nfurled canvas to the main boom.  He guides another to the\nmidships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the\nhuge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin.  He loosens the\nhalyard and hands it to Robin.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Take a turn under the pin and lead\n          it out to the others.  You guys in\n          the rear take up the slack.  Heave\n          together now...\n\nIn a beautiful tenor voice, Bill begins to croon a sea\nchanty, an old whaling song with an Irish lilt.\n\n                         BILL\n                  (singing)\n          \"When the sun came up there was\n          whisky in the cup...\"\n\nThe more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the\nbeat.\n\n                         BOYS\n          \"When the sun came up there was\n          whisky in the cup...\"\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Come on the rest of you, sing!  Belt\n          it out like men!!\n\nThe newer guys like Chuck, John, Robin and Terry look at\neach other like this is the queerest thing they have ever\nheard of.\n\n                         BILL\n                  (singing)\n          \"Not one of us was a sober...\"\n\nThe boys return the verse half heartedly.  Lawford ties\noff his line and stares them down.  Skipper notices that\nthe work has stopped.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          What's wrong Mr. Lawford.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          It seems we're short on singers.\n\nSkipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Everyone sings aboard a wind jammer\n          gentlemen.  It lets everyone know\n          you're in sync.  It shows unity,\n          that all thoughts are one.  A crew\n          that sings together stays together.\n          Besides, I like it.  So, pipe up and\n          be sailors.\n\n                         JOHN\n                  (in a whisper)\n          Everybody swims, everybody sings...\n          What's next?  Tap dancing?\n\nLawford and Rick leap up onto the line pulling it down\nwith their body weight.  They sing out the chorus.  The\ncrew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great\nmainsail starts to rise.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Tie it off!!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to Bill)\n          Outer.\n\n                         BILL\n          Outer Jib!\n\n                         CHARLIE\n                  (confused)\n          Outta what?\n\nCoached by Tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist\nthe jib.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to Bill)\n          We'll bear off to port and run down\n          wind.\n\n                         BILL\n          Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the\n          mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib\n          sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim\n          and Dick go aloft to unstop the\n          forecourse.  George will show you\n          what to do.  Tod, show your men the\n          forward pinrail and stand ready on\n          the buntlines and clewlines.\n          Forecourse first... work upward.\n\nThe newcomers watch Bill with new-found respect.  George,\nJohn and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto\nthe footropes.  It's unsteady work and there's confusion\neverywhere.  But through it all, they continue to sing.\n\nLawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the\nothers move into their positions.  When Bill sees the\nyardarm crew is in place...\n\n                         BILL\n          Unstop the squares!\n\n                         YARDARM CREW\n          Unstop the squares!!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to Chuck)\n          Fall off to port.  Ease her around\n          to a heading of northeast.  Sing out\n          when you're there.\n\nAs the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into\na scalloped pattern.  As the bow falls off the wind the\nsnapping main and jib billow.  Stiffening to the wind, the\nship heels and surges forward.\n\nBefore her awakening power, everyone changes their stance\nand grabs for a handhold.  Lawford slowly pays out the\nmainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines\nreleasing the stops on the other squaresails.\n\n                         CHUCK\n                  (in a whisper)\n          Ah... Northeast... sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (barking)\n          Speak up boy!\n\nChuck jumps, startled.  He self-consciously calls out.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Northeast sir!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Unfurl the squares!\n\nTod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and\nthe great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending\na shudder through the rig.  The bow's wake sizzles with\nthe added surge.  As each of the squares fall, Alice and\nLawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's\nposition.\n\nChuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty\nof the canvas that the Albatross carries.\n\n                         BILL\n          Raise the inner jib!  Raise the\n          forestaysail!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we\n          jibe now we'll have a lot of people\n          in the water.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes, sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          All stop on the engine.\n\n                         BILL\n          All stop on the engine!\n\nBill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves\nit to the stop position.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Behold gentlemen.  The power of the\n          wind!\n\nAs the sails billow the Albatross seems transformed.\nEveryone stops and looks up.  The vessel heels and with a\npowerful surge, launches into the waves.  White foam\nsplashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through\nthe water.  Chuck's face is full of wonder.  It is a\nmagical moment.  Then the crew begins to cheer.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Did we lose anybody?\n\n                         ALICE\n          Not yet.\n\nLONG SHOT\n\nThe Albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful\nimage of another time.  And yet, here she is.\n\nON DECK\n\nEach of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment.\nMusic builds.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Chart us a course for the windward\n          side.\n\nAlice considers his request.\n\n                         ALICE\n          That low passed through last night.\n          May be a little bumpy out there.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          It's time these boys saw some real\n          blue water.\n\n\nEXT.  THE OPEN SEA - LATER\n\nThe bow of the Albatross explodes through the top of a\nfifteen foot swell.  The sky is clear but the wind is\nfierce.  In spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and\nsailing well.\n\nThe crew has never seen mountains of water like this.\nDisaster seems imminent.  Bill has assembled them in front\nof the wheel house.  They are all holding on for dear\nlife.  Even John seems shaken.  Skipper magically stands\neffortlessly before them on the rolling deck.  He remains\nperfectly dry.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Well... now that I have your\n          undivided attention... I'd like to\n          take this opportunity to make a few\n          points...\n\n                         TERRY\n                  (aside)\n          This guy is certifiable...\n\n                         PHIL\n          Suicidal...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          The first thing is I don't like\n          people talking when I'm talking so\n          the two of you, shut up.\n\nCaught, Terry and Phil button up.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Second, the next one of you who\n          doesn't jump like a bunny when Mr.\n          Butler gives an order is gonna spend\n          the rest of this trip scrubbing\n          bilges.  He's a better sailor today\n          than any ten of you will be when\n          this is all over.\n\nSkipper directs the next comment directly at John.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          And if I catch anybody, ever,\n          jumping off a yard arm again I will\n          personally break what bones are left\n          and send you home in a wheel chair.\n\nA wave explodes over the bow.  A wall of water crashes\nover the deck knocking down several of the boys.  Terry\ncan't take it anymore and explodes.\n\n                         TERRY\n          We're gonna die!!!  We're all gonna\n          die!\n\nHe lunges at Skipper but Lawford one arms him.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Excellent point.  As you might have\n          noticed, being out here pretty much\n          puts you in the moment.  If you\n          panic, if you lose your head, you\n          die.  Maybe you take your mates with\n          you.  How'd you like to have to bet\n          on Terry here getting us home today?\n          Each one of you is responsible for\n          the rest.  \"Where we go one, we go\n          all\".  If your buddy is asleep at\n          the switch we're all fish food.\n\nHe's making his point which is lost on no one.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          The ship beneath you is not a toy\n          and sailing is not a game.  The\n          Albatross will take us far\n          gentlemen, but she demands constant\n          attention.  Respect her, and we'll\n          do fine.  Oh, and one more thing.\n          There is nothing that goes on, on\n          this boat that I don't know about.\n          She speaks to me in the night.  So\n          don't test me.  Not even a little.\n\nSkipper walks over and puts an arm around Terry who is\nfighting sobs.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Nothing like experience to put\n          things in perspective.  Huh son?\n                  (to Bill)\n          Alright.  Let's go home.\n\n\nINT.  CHART HOUSE - DAY\n\nLawford addresses some of the crew.  Chuck, Robin and John\nare among them.  John glares at Lawford.  The guys giggle.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          That's not a satisfactory answer.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Look, save it for somebody else will\n          ya.  This ancient shit doesn't have\n          anything to do with me.\n\nLawford pauses for a moment and then explodes\ntheatrically.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Shit?!!!\n\nHe slams a text book into John's hands.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Read for me please the words of Mr.\n          Keats at the bottom of the page.\n\nJohn stares back, simmering.  Robin interrupts the\npotential confrontation and reaches for the book.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Shut up donut.\n\nJohn pushes Robin's hands away and studies the page for a\nmoment.  He begins reading but struggles with the cadence.\n\n                         JOHN\n                  (reading)\n          Much have I traveled in realms of\n          gold/ And many goodly states and\n          kingdoms seen/ Round many western\n          islands have I been/ Which bards in\n          fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one\n          wide expanse had I been told/ That\n          deep-browed Homer ruled as his\n          demesne.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          You know what he is talking about\n          here?\n\nBlank faces.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n                  (ranting)\n          Awe.

The Albatross is under full sail leaving\nBermuda for the last time.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          And so it was the Albatross that\n          took to the open sea with the wind\n          in her snapping canvas and a bone of\n          white foam in her teeth... In each\n          of us were feelings of anticipation\n          and hesitation for the man at the\n          wheel and of the unfamiliar world he\n          was leading us into.\n\nShe crashes through the surf -- driving, majestic music,\nbuilding.\n\nDECK - DAY\n\nThe crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail.  Chuck\nstruggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in.\n\nALOFT\n\nThe crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the\nrigging.\n\nBOWSPRIT NET\n\nThe crew pull down the jib trying to furl it.  Most of the\nsail ends up dragging in the water.\n\nABOVE\n\nThe squaresails are dropped simultaneously.\n\nWIDE\n\nWhite foam boils from the bow of the Albatross as she\ncrashes through the waves.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nAlice smiles and puts her arms around Skipper's waist.\nIt's coming together.\n\nFORETOP - SAME\n\nSkipper stands at the rail, looking out.  The seas are up\nand the masts are pitching widely from side to side.\n\nChuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling\nwith one of the squaresails.  The pitching mast catches\nhim by surprise and he slips.  He tumbles down, tangled in\nthe lines.  A rope wraps around his neck, choking him.\nRobin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Bill!!  Skipper!!\n\nRobin freezes.  Skipper leaps into the rigging like a\nspider and, in a few seconds, wrestles Chuck free and\ncarries him down to the deck.  Chuck coughs, catching his\nbreath.  The color is gone from Skipper's face.  This was\na close call.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You all right?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          It was my fault.

Right now.\n\nRobin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung,\nthen the second.  He stops and steals a peek up.  The mast\nis swaying.  He freezes, his lip starts to tremble.  All\neyes are on him.  Phil chuckles.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Do you have something to say?\n\n                         PHIL\n                  (smug)\n          No.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Then keep your mouth shut.\n\nPhil backs off, stunned.

Skipper turns to the crew.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Survival means discipline and\n          assimilation.

His face\nis but inches from Robin's.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          One hand in front of the other son.\n          We'll do it together.\n\nRobin reaches for the next rung.  He looks down.  Skipper\ngrowls at him.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Don't look down.  Look in my eyes!\n          Climb!

Skipper climbs and screams\nwith him.\n\n                         TOGETHER\n          Auuuggghhh!!!!\n\nRobin clutches the rung with a death grip.  Then, he looks\ndown.  His bladder releases.  Hot urine runs down his legs\nand splashes, steaming, onto the deck.  The crew is\nhorrified.  Robin weeps.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Oh, god...\n\nSkipper backs off.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Don't hate yourself.  Hate your\n          weakness.

You wanna act\n          like babies, then get off my boat.\n\nStunned, the crew is speechless.  Chuck instinctively goes\nto help Robin.  Skipper snaps like a turtle.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to Chuck)\n          He can take care of himself.\n                  (to others)\n          Any other 'phobias' I need to know\n          about?\n\nSkipper fires a look towards Phil.\n\n                         PHIL\n          No, sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Excellent.

CHART HOUSE - DUSK\n\nThe chart house is the communication and navigation center\nfor the boat.

We've\n          got to bring them together.  Make\n          them a crew.  We're as strong as our\n          weakest link and I don't want to\n          find that out the hard way.  So, I\n          will challenge them and they will\n          come together.\n\n                         GEORGE\n                  (sarcastic)\n          Yes sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You know the best thing about being\n          a Skipper is the worst thing.  It's\n          all my responsibility.  So I'll tell\n          you what George, you stay off of my\n          bridge, and I'll stay out of your\n          galley.  We'll get along that way.\n\nEveryone's quiet, but clear.  Skipper and Alice exit.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          Fucking bastard.\n\nLawford lets out a belly laugh.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          I've seen him snatch the tail of the\n          tempest and stuff it, screaming,\n          into a bottle.  The bilges are full\n          of them.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          What do you mean?\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          He's been beyond the reach.  To the\n          edge of the abyss and back.  He'll\n          do well by us all George.  He's a\n          real salt.  There's no malice in him\n          and there's nothing more dear to him\n          than his boys.

Might\n          get interesting.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Shouldn't we turn away?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You can't run from the wind son.\n          You trim your sails, face the music\n          and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's\n          close her up, dog, tight.\n\nClose on hatches and skylights slamming closed and cinched\ntight.\n\nBELOW DECKS\n\nBulkhead doors are closed and cranked down tightly.\n\nIN THE GALLEY\n\nPots and pans crash around.\n\nIN THE MAIN CABIN\n\nThe cabin doors on the bookcase swing open and dump books\non top of Alice.  She turns and looks at the mess,\nannoyed.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - SAME\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Furl the squares, reef the main, and\n          bend on the storm jib, but keep it\n          furled.  Drop everything but the\n          inner jib.  I want everybody down\n          before we get any lightning.\n\nBill bolts forward with Lawford barking orders.  Most of\nthe crew are still ill, but climb into the rigging and\nbegin dropping sail.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          Why's it always happen at night?\n\nSkipper regards George, annoyed.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          George... I want hot food in\n          everybody.  Get to it.\n\nGeorge returns to the galley.  Alice joins Skipper at the\nwheelhouse handing him foul-weather gear.\n\n                         ALICE\n          Looks like weather.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yep.\n\nHe slips on a yellow slicker.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Do me a favor and tell Bill once\n          she's dogged down I want everyone to\n          break out their slickers and make\n          sure their gear is stowed or we'll\n          spend the next week sorting\n          underwear.\n                  (to the others)\n          Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil\n          will stand the watch.

Charlie, take\n          his place.\n\nPhil goes below, a little ashamed.  The crew scatters.\nChuck, still at the wheel, pipes up.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          If it's all the same, I'd like to\n          stay on deck.\n\nSkipper regards Chuck, who looks back with both fear and\neagerness.  Suddenly he sees something in this kid.  Maybe\nhimself.  He almost smiles.  Almost.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Take the wheel.\n\n\nEXT.  FORETOP - SAME\n\nDark clouds blot out the sky and stars.  Thunder rumbles\nfar away.  The seas have built but there's no wind... yet.\nWith no steerage, the ship is tossed.\n\nTod hangs high above the heaving deck continuing to furl.\nThe mast swings from side to side, but the air has gone\ndead calm.  Skipper looks up, anticipating.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Everyone out of the rigging NOW!\n\n                         BILL\n          Everybody down!

Then it\nhits.\n\nA wall of torrential rain drums the deck amid a tympany of\nthunder and flashing lightning.  The bow explodes through\ntwelve foot swells.  This is what the Albatross was born\nto do.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n\nIt's all the crew can do to stay in their bunks.  Pots\ncrash, books and personals go flying.  The guys are\nscared.\n\nON DECK\n\nThe main and jib sheets tighten.  Skipper looks at Chuck\nand Bill.  It all comes down to moments like these and he\nloves it.\n\nSuddenly, there is a loud CRACK!  A violent flapping\nnoise.  Skipper leaps to the port and looks forward.  Tod\ncomes running back.\n\n                         TOD\n          We blew the inner!\n\n                         ALICE\n          I'll go.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Bring it down and run up the storm\n          jib.  We'll fix it later.  Stay out\n          of reach of the blocks!\n\nTod and Alice disappear.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (with a twinkle)\n          Well, we're in it now.\n\nChuck studies him, frightened, but reassured.\n\n\nEXT.  BOW - SAME\n\nThe shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind.\nThe block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it.  No\none dares go near it.  For a moment, it seems to hang\nthere seductively.  John, naive of its power, leaps for\nthe rail and grabs it.\n\n                         ALICE\n          NOOO!!!\n\nSuddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling John\nhigh off the deck and over the side.  He holds on for dear\nlife, screaming.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to Chuck)\n          Hold her steady.\n\nSkipper bolts forward.\n\nAT THE BOW\n\nAlice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the\npin and shoves it into Tod's hands.\n\n                         ALICE\n          Release this when I tell you!!\n\nSkipper joins Tod as Alice scrambles along the deck and\npulls herself into the bowsprit netting.  When the block\nand jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail\nyelling...\n\n                         ALICE\n          NOW!!!\n\nAs John is snapped inboard Alice leaps up, grabbing the\nsail, leaning out over the open water.  Waves explode\nthrough the netting.  As Tod releases the halyard, John\nfalls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive.  Lawford\nand Skipper pull Alice from the bowsprit.\n\nSkipper looks her over.  Relieved.  No broken bones.  Good\nwork.  But then this is what he expects.  He respects her\nand now, everyone can see why.  He looks at John sprawled\non the deck.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Be careful will ya?\n\n                         JOHN\n          What ever you say Cap...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Let's get that storm jib up.\n\nSkipper gives Alice a private look, then returns to the\nstern where Chuck holds tightly onto the wheel.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          The storm lasted sixteen hours and\n          it set us all on equal footing.  It\n          was the first time that we shared an\n          episode on an even plane.  As we\n          stood our watches we were equally\n          out of control of our situation,\n          regardless of our physical abilities\n          or social backgrounds.  And though\n          our real feelings lay hidden beneath\n          bravado and defiance, we were no\n          longer strangers.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nThe crew is cleaning up.  Alice supervises repairs to the\njib while others stow line, scrub the deck and chip paint.\nLawford paces.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          You know what they say in the Navy\n          don't you?\n\n                         RICK\n          What's that, Big Daddy?\n\nThe more experienced crew members have heard this all\nbefore.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          \"If it moves, salute it.  If it\n          doesn't move, pick it up.  If it's\n          too big to pick up, paint it!\"\n\nThe boys mockingly salute Lawford as he walks by.

On cue,\nhalf of the crew descend, dragging him kicking and\nscreaming into the bowswain's chair, and over the side.\nThe guys cheer.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Come on you guys, this isn't funny!\n\nThe seat spins, twists and swings from behind the boat.\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          Come on Chucky.  Show us a little\n          grit.\n\nThey lower the chair so it glides just above the surface.\nWhen the boat noses into a swell Chuck gets quite a ride.\nOnce he has the hang of it, fear turns to elation.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          YEEE HAAAA!!!!!\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          Okay, who's next?\n\n                         PHIL\n          You gotta be kidding?

Once he gets the hang of it, he\ngets into it.  He maneuvers the chair like a plane,\nforcing himself deep into the waves and then blasting back\nto the surface.\n\nOFF THE PORT SIDE\n\nRobin is trolling.  The line takes a tremendous hit and\nRobin's reel screams.  Tod is at the wheel and turns.\n\n                         TOD\n          There she blows!!\n\nTwo hundred feet out something large and pissed has taken\nthe bait.  The crew turn and look.

It's a six foot Thresher shark.\nTerry sees it too and freaks, suddenly thrashing and\nscreaming.\n\n                         TERRY\n          Get me out!!!

Sprawling onto the deck.\n\n                         TERRY\n          Oh Jesus!  Oh Jesus Christ!!\n\nThe crew turn and cheer Robin on as he brings the shark\nalongside.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          He must be two hundred pounds!\n          Bring him in close and try to hold\n          him steady.\n\nGeorge leans out over the rail, trying to get the hook\ninto a gill.  Several of the boys hold onto him as the\nfish flops around violently.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          Got him!\n\nSkipper comes down to inspect the catch.  The shark is\nlonger than Terry is tall and thrashes in the the water,\nsnapping and twisting.  Terry stands shaking, freaked.\nAll of them are.\n\n                         RICK\n          Damn Terr, you're whiter than Sister\n          Mary Anne's butt.\n\nThe guys laugh nervously.  Terry just stares at the man\neater, but it's infectious.  After a moment he's laughing\ntoo.  Skipper slaps him on the back with a wry smile.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Well, now you have something to\n          write home about.\n\nMore laughter.  Suddenly, Tom, who is lookout on the\nforetop, cries out.\n\n                         TOM\n          Land ho!!!  Land ho!!!\n\nEveryone turns around to look.  The guys at the stern let\ngo of George and he nearly tumbles overboard.  In that\ninstant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears\nback into the sea.  Robin and George share a stunned look.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          Shit.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          There's more where that came from.\n\nSkipper returns to the wheelhouse with Alice.  Together\nthey scan the horizon.  Clouds build over the land ahead.\n\n                         ALICE\n          Cheated death again.\n\nHe slips an arm around her.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yep.\n\n\nEXT.  ANTIGUA - HARBOR - DAY\n\nA group of islanders have assembled to watch the crew\napproach in the long boats.\n\n\nINT.  LONG BOAT - SAME\n\nChuck gazes across the strange landscape.  As the boats\ndock, the crew pile out and scatter.  Local children\nfollow them wherever they go.  Chuck, Robin and John find\nthemselves alone.  Most of the buildings are primitive.\nThey wander over to a shop.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          What do you say?  Cokes?

Robin speaks up loud\nenough for them to hear.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          You're right Chuck.  There's nothing\n          quite as refreshing as a cold ten\n          cent Coke that only costs ten cents!\n\nThe three clink their bottles.  Mike and Chris slink away.\n\n\nEXT.  COLONIAL FORT - DAY\n\nA crumbling fort overlooks the harbor.  Below, the\nAlbatross floats like a pearl on the azure blue water.\nLarge bronze muzzle-loading cannons still lie in their\ngunports, aimed at the sea, waiting for pirate ships that\nwill never come.\n\nEach of the guys are sprawled on a cannon, taking in the\nCaribbean view.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          You think Skipper and Alice do it?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Do what?\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Ya know... \"It\".\n\n                         CHUCK\n          That's like wondering if your mom\n          and dad do it.

ALBATROSS - HARBOR - NIGHT\n\nThe boat moves off leaving the lights of Antigua behind.\nChuck watches as the island disappears below the horizon.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nThe wind is up and the seas are high.  The ship is under\nfull sail driving at top speed.  Foam sprays from the bow\nas it slices through the water -- what she was born to do.\nThe crew line the starboard rail, thrilled to be part of\nthe performance.\n\nTod is at the wheel with Chris nearby.  The sails tower\nabove him like a mountain of silk.  He wrestles the wheel,\ncareful to hold his course against the powerful trade\nwinds.\n\nSkipper, making his rounds inspects the heading on the\ncompass and nods.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          It's a good sail boys.\n\nTod and Chris beam.

Phil slinks behind the chart house, hurt, and\nangry.  He spots a spear gun stowed against the chart\nhouse.\n\nAs Tod and Chris pull in the main, it strains and\nstretches against the powerful wind.\n\nPhil aims the spear gun at the mainsail from behind the\nchart house and silently fires.  There is a wicked POP as\nthe spear punctures the sail, passing through it, followed\nby a loud shredding as the huge sail splits.\n\n                         TOD\n          Jesus Christ!!  Let it out.  Let it\n          out!!\n\nThe sound brings Skipper onto the deck like a shot.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Hard to port!  Hard to port!!\n\nCalamity, as Tod cranks the ship into the wind.  The\ncanvas goes limp as the ship hauls to a dead stop.  People\ndive everywhere to drop sail.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Start the engine.  All ahead full!!\n          Scallop the Square and drop the\n          rest!!\n\nHe shoots a glare at Tod and Chris.\n\n                         TOD\n                  (bewildered)\n          I don't know what happened Skipper.\n          It just blew out.\n\nSkipper turns to the task at hand without a word.  What\nhad been praise is now reduced to embarrassment and\nconfusion.\n\nPhil, still hidden behind the chart house returns the\nspear gun and smiles to himself at Tod's arrogance turned\nhumility.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - TOBAGO CAYS - DAY\n\nThe Albatross has dropped anchor along a remote group of\nflat, lush atolls.  Tall palm trees grow almost to the\nwaters edge.

If she's\n          adrift, if they're asleep, she could\n          run aground.

Everything is\n          under control.  The jug head's going\n          to think of something.\n\nWithout warning.  John lunges at Phil.  Phil screams,\ntrying to defend himself.  The guys all dive in.  Suddenly\nit's an all out brawl.\n\nJohn out of control pounding Phil's head against the seat\nof the boat.\n\nSuddenly, from behind, comes a blistering \"THWACK!!\" as\nChuck breaks an oar over the back of John's head.\nStunned, John lets go of Phil and turns, blood dripping\nfrom the back of his head.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Nobody calls me an idiot.\n\nHe weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand.\nThe guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.\n\n                         PHIL\n          God damn it man.

Now what\n          are we supposed to do?\n\nChuck and Robin hoist John up and drag him under a palm\ntree, propping him up.  The others huddle to stay warm.\n\n\nEXT.  BEACH - MORNING\n\nThe crew's asleep in the tropical heat of day.  Bloodied\nand sun burned.  A fly buzzes around Rick's face, waking\nhim.  He sits up sunburned and sore trying to focus.  He\ngazes across the water, stupefied.\n\n                         RICK\n          Oh-my-god...\n\nThe others stir and follow his gaze.  The Albatross sits\nin exactly the spot where they left her.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          I'm not sure if this is really good\n          or really bad.\n\n\nEXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY\n\nThe sound of a rod and reel spinning wildly.  George tries\nto maintain control as the rod nearly jumps out of his\nhands.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          I got a live one!\n\nSkipper, Alice and Bill watch the shoreline as the boys\nlaunch the long boat into the surf.  George is struggling.\nA beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but Skipper\nnever takes his eyes off of his boys.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          The thing about fishing George, is\n          you need to let 'em run some.  Give\n          'em just enough slack so they don't\n          break the line.  But at the same\n          time you've gotta keep enough\n          tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em\n          in slowly so they don't really know\n          they're hooked.\n\nSuddenly George's line goes slack.  He nearly falls over\nbackwards.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          I'll try and remember that.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nHound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys\nstand before Skipper and the others.  Skipper looks dark\nand angry.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          You know what a loose cannon is?\n          'Bout the worst thing that could\n          happen to a wooden ship.  All it\n          took was one, crashing around the\n          deck in a storm... It'd smash\n          everything in its way, maybe take\n          out a mast or punch a hole right\n          through the hull.  Think about it,\n          just one cannon not tied down, not\n          anchored, could take a whole 'Man of\n          War' straight to the bottom.\n\n                         MIKE\n                  (aside)\n          But we don't have any cannons?\n\nChris jabs him in the ribs.\n\n                         CHRIS\n                  (hushed)\n          Shut up!\n\nSkipper turns and faces them.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Now, if the Skipper were smart, if\n          he could see a storm building, why\n          he'd cut loose every gun on his\n          boat.  Even though it would leave\n          him at a disadvantage in battle,\n          he'd push 'em into the sea.  Better\n          chance running for port than risk\n          the entire ship, his crew.\n\nHe takes a pause making sure he has their attention for\nthis part.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          People are like that sometimes.\n          They cut loose and before you know\n          it, they're knocking holes in\n          everything.  So you gotta ask\n          yourself if it might not be better\n          to just put 'em off before they sink\n          the whole thing.  I mean after all,\n          you can always get new cannons.\n\nHe walks back to his place at the rail.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (beat)\n          I want a tight ship, everybody\n          shaved and in clean clothes when we\n          make Curacao.  If it goes well, if\n          your mid terms are acceptable, I may\n          reconsider my decision about the\n          rest of the trip.  That's all.\n\nDejected, the crew goes below.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nUnder sail.  Skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the\ncrew taking exams.  Each writes furiously as Alice\nscribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the\nchart house door.\n\nAs the boys scratch out the problems, John seems\nparalyzed.  He looks over at Phil and copies down his\nanswer.  He checks crib notes hidden in his shorts.  Chuck\nand Robin both see this and exchange looks.\n\n\nINT.  AFT CABIN - DAY\n\nJohn makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the\nhead.  Robin follows.  Chuck drops down the aft\ncompanionway, intercepting John.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Where you going?\n\n                         JOHN\n          To take a piss.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Really?\n\nJohn turns around, surprised, sandwiched.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come\n          in and shake it for me?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          If you're gonna cheat, you might as\n          well copy off somebody who's gonna\n          get the answer right.\n\n                         JOHN\n          You've gotta be kidding.  Get the\n          fuck outta my way!\n\nChuck throws open the Engine Room door and they shove John\ninside.\n\n                         JOHN\n          What the hell!!!\n\nChuck manages to pin John.  Robin checks his pockets and\ncomes up with the crib notes.  Chuck lets go.  John\nsnatches them, ashamed.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Takin' a piss?\n\nJohn turns away.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Why, man?\n\n                         JOHN\n          I don't have to listen to this.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes you do, stupid.  Because if you\n          don't, I'm gonna go right up there\n          and have a heart to heart with\n          Skipper and you'll be on the first\n          plane back to idiotville.\n\nJohn lunges at Chuck, sending them both sprawling.  Robin\nleaps on top of John.\n\n                         ROBIN\n          Cut it out man!!  Stop it!!!  What's\n          the matter with you?  If Phil had\n          caught you he'd have ratted you out\n          in a second.  You get caught\n          cheating, you'll get kicked off the\n          boat.\n\nJohn explodes, tears flowing.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I cheated to get on the boat!!!  All\n          right?!\n\n                         CHUCK\n          What?\n\nHe lets go of Chuck and stands up trying to hide his\nemotions.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I doctored my grades so I'd make the\n          cut.

You\n          know why it takes me so long to\n          write papers?  because I can't\n          spell.

CURACAO - HARBOR - DUSK\n\nAs a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the\nAlbatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks\nseveral hundred yards away.

Phil is suddenly\nfull of rage.  This is an invasion of his privacy.\nEveryone feels it.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          Hop to boy.  We haven't got all day.\n\nPhil's anger turns to resigned humiliation.  He stops,\nstaring down at his parents.  Skipper puts a hand on his\nshoulder.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          I didn't know, Phil.\n\nPhil nods, head down and walks down the ramp.  All watch\nhim go, feeling for him.\n\n\nEXT.  OPEN WATER - DAY\n\nThe sails begin to rise but unlike earlier, the guys SING\nout like the Vienna Boys Choir and it's having the desired\nimpressive effect on the women.\n\n                         CREW TOGETHER\n          When the sun came up there was\n          whisky in the cup/ and not one of us\n          was sober/ Kerry thought she saw a\n          picture, but it really was the sun/\n          then we knew the party was over...\n\nThe weather was perfect, brisk and steady under the trade\nwind swells.  The voices trail away as the ship moves off.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          Curacao seemed out of a dream,\n          somehow make-believe.  But, as Ohio\n          drew further and further away, it\n          was home that began to seem unreal,\n          drifting somewhere in the foggy\n          reaches of our memories.  And I knew\n          that each of us was falling in love.\n          But not only with these wonderful\n          women or the swaying palms and\n          porcelain beaches... We were falling\n          in love with the experience we were\n          sharing, and with who we were\n          becoming.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT\n\nThe crew is getting ready for a farewell party.  Each\nmember is primping.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Bregitta.

You're\n          talking to a guy whose idea of big\n          romance is a palm full of Vaseline.\n\n                         TERRY\n          Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't\n          seen you swapping spit with anybody.\n\nTod smiles as he slowly pulls something from his pocket.\nIt's a pair of girls' cotton underwear.\n\n                         TOD\n          That's because I'm discrete, moron.\n\nThe guys try to wrestle the underwear away from him.  Just\nthen Skipper descends the companionway.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Alright, gentlemen, we sail with the\n          tide.  Twenty-three hundred.

SCHOOL - GARDENS - NIGHT\n\nDecorated with colored paper lanterns and streamers, a\nSTEEL DRUM BAND softly plays in the b.g.  The crew slow-\ndance with their girls, dressed in cotton that seems to\nglow against their dark skin.\n\nMs. Boyde is scrutinizing the body contact between Chuck\nand BREGITTA.  Their lips appear pasted together and she\ndoesn't like it.  Lawford sees what is about to happen and\nhands his slimy cigar to George who reacts.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Hold this, will ya?\n\nLawford intercepts Ms. Boyde.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Madam, I would consider it a\n          privilege if you would allow me to\n          take you on a tour of the dance\n          floor.\n\nMs. Boyde is so flattered, it is all she can do to extend\nher hand.  Lawford leads her away and glares at Rick.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          You're very light on your feet Ms.\n          Boyde.  Was it you who taught all of\n          these young ladies the art of the\n          dance?\n\nMs. Boyde giggles like a school girl.\n\n\nEXT.

I didn't want to come\n          but I did.  Why do you have to\n          embarrass me.  Why can't you just\n          leave me alone?\n\nFrancis slaps Phil across the face nearly knocking him out\nof his chair.  Everyone and everything.  It's humiliating.\n\n                         PEGGY\n          Francis!!\n\nShe cradles Phil's red face.  He fights the tears.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          Listen to me, you thankless little\n          prick.

We\n          weren't much older than they are.\n\nThe music changes to a calypso waltz.

There's something about him that\nstill makes her blush.\n\nSkipper leads her to the dance floor.  He hesitates,\nlooking deeply into her eyes.  As they begin to dance, the\nboys notice and exchange looks.\n\nLawford and George sit across the quad, sipping punch and\nsmoking cigars.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          If I didn't know better I'd say the\n          old man was acting almost halfway\n          human.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          He is halfway human.\n\nOne by one the couples clear for the Skipper and his\nbride.  They glide, lost in each others arms.  They dance\na dance for the ages.  As if it might be for the last\ntime.  The music swells.\n\n\nEXT.  PIER - NIGHT\n\nChuck and Bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full\nmoon hangs above the horizon.  Bregitta doesn't understand\nwhat Chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I can't remember feeling like this\n          about myself, a place, someone like\n          you.  We've come such a long way,\n          seen so much.  But nothing like this.\n\nBregitta smiles and takes Chuck's hand.  He's nervous.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I'm not the best at expressing\n          myself.  Maybe the only reason I can\n          now is because I know you don't\n          understand me.\n                  (beat)\n          I like you so much.  Too much.  But\n          how could I?  I mean, if we can't\n          even communicate, how could I know\n          you?  It's confusing.  We sail in an\n          hour and I'll never see you again.\n\nBregitta takes Chuck's face gently and kisses him\ntenderly.  Then, in perfect English...\n\n                         BREGITTA\n          I like you, too.\n\nChuck's eyes widen, astonished.  Bregitta smiles, takes\nChuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat\nmoored to the pier.\n\n                         BREGITTA\n          Come on.  We don't have much time.\n\nBlushing deeply, Chuck follows her into the boat.\n\n\nEXT.  STREET - SAME\n\nRobin walks down the street hand in hand with one of the\ngirls.  A long string of colored lights illuminate the\nlength of the street.  Robin clumsily tries to kiss the\ngirl.

ALBATROSS - DAY\n\nThe ship is under full-sail driving before a brisk\nfollowing wind.  It takes two on the helm to keep her\nsafely on course.

There they blow!!\n          Dolphins off the bow!!!\n\nEveryone rushes to see.  Dolphins leaping out of the\nwater.  It's a magnificent game they play with ships.  The\ncrew cheers as each one explodes out of the sea, close\nenough to touch.\n\nIsolated, Phil watches.  Angry, cut off.  Chuck eyes him,\nworried.\n\nBill and Charlie rig the bowswain's chair and lower Rick\ninto the water.  Suddenly, the dolphins are everywhere.\nRick pets them as they swim back and forth.  Shear joy.\n\nPhil reaches for the spear gun.  Nobody notices as he\nloads and takes aim.\n\nSuddenly... with a crack, everyone spins around.  A large\nfemale dolphin leaps out of the water, bloody foam\nspraying from her blow hole.  She lets out an agonizing\nscream.  Phil holds her fast.\n\n                         CHRIS\n          Jesus Christ!\n\nThe crew can only watch, stunned.

We'll\n          bring her up with the davit.\n\nA dory is lowered with John and Bill inside.  Once near\nthe water they maneuver the struggling dolphin into a\ncanvas harness.

The\nsickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the\nanimal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two\nthumps of her tail and, it's over.\n\nSkipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and\napproaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs\nthe spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the\npieces into the sea.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          What the hell is wrong with you?!\n\nPhil begins to shake with rage.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Come on.

Do it now!\n\nThe crew scrambles for the rigging, frantically dropping\nsail.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (hitting each word)\n          Who the hell do they think they are?\n\nAs the sail comes down, the Albatross slows to a stop.\nThe Cubans inch closer and begin speaking over a loud\nspeaker in Spanish.  The seas are high and the two ships\nrise and fall with the large swells between them.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          They want us to identify ourselves.\n\nChuck returns with a bull horn.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Tell them we're the American School\n          Ship, Albatross.\n\nGeorge replies in Spanish over the bull horn.  The Cubans\nanswer.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          They think we're carrying Cuban\n          refugees.\n                  (beat)\n          Skipper, they mean to board us.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Not a chance.  Remind them that\n          according to the Geneva Convention,\n          firing on a civilian vessel on the\n          high sea is an act of war.\n\nAnother exchange between George and the Cubans.  The crew\nlay flat on the deck, terrified.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          They say they are acting on the\n          direct authority of Fidel Castro.\n\nSkipper defiantly swings up onto the gunnel rail.  The\nCuban Captain gives an order and one of his sailors jumps\ninto the turret of the anti aircraft guns and swivels\naround pointing both barrels at the Albatross.  Skipper\nstands firm, between the shrouds.  Silence.  A standoff.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Tell 'em to come aboard.\n\nGeorge sends the return message.  There is a pause, then\nthe murmurs of the relieved crew.  Skipper swings down but\nnever takes his eyes off the gunboat.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (to crew)\n          We've come a long way gentlemen.\n          But this is no time for heroes.  I\n          know you're much more, but I need you\n          to be boys right now.  That's an\n          order.  Now scatter and find your\n          passports.\n\n\nINT.  CABIN - DAY\n\nLaundry, books and mementos go flying as each boy\nscrambles to dig up his passport.  Terry sits among his\nthings, dazed.  Bill notices.\n\n                         BILL\n          What's wrong?\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nA small launch filled with Cuban soldiers approaches the\nAlbatross.  The crew climb on deck and line up along the\nChart House with their passports.  Lawford walks up to\nSkipper.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          We've got a problem.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          What's that?\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Terry left his passport in Curacao.\n          We could hide him...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          No.  Bring him on deck with the\n          others.\n\nThe Cubans cast their lines up and climb aboard carrying\nside arms.  Terry reluctantly joins his crew mates.  The\nCOMMANDING OFFICER faces Skipper as his men go down the\nline checking the passports.  Others search the ship.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          Chicken is a fool's game captain.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          So is violating international law.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          But you invited is aboard.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Your cannons made a compelling\n          argument.\n\nOne of the Cubans pulls Terry out of line and brings him\nforward.  He alerts the Commander in Spanish.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          Stow away?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          He left his passport in Curacao.\n          It's being mailed to Panama.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          That is unfortunate.  We'll have to\n          take him with us.\n\nTerry is petrified.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a\n          dress.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Nobody aboard my ship is going\n          anywhere.\n\nSkipper stares him down.  The Commander signals to one of\nhis men who disappears into the Chart House.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          Perhaps in appreciation for our\n          country's pursuit of peace, you\n          might offer us some, token of\n          gratitude.\n\nSkipper doesn't really have a choice.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          What do you want?\n\nThe Cuban returns from the Chart House with the Ships\nsextant and hands it to the Commander.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          This.  And...\n\nPointing to the ships compass.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          ... and that.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          You've got to be kidding!!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (cold)\n          Take it.\n\nWithout hesitation the Cubans pull the large brass compass\nfrom its base.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Now, get the hell off my ship.\n\nAs they leave the ship, they pause.  The Commander looks\nback at the Skipper, then deliberately drops both sextant\nand compass into the sea.\n\n                         COMMANDER\n          You'll really have something to\n          teach your students now.\n\nSkipper stands towering above them.  The Cuban captain\nsmiles up at him.  Amazingly, Skipper addresses him in\nperfect Spanish.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Las estrellas es lo unico, que un\n          marinero verdadero se mesesita para\n          encontrarse.  Verdade Patron?\n\nThe Cubans stare back, frowning, amazed as they motor\naway.\n\nThe crew are stunned by what they have just witnessed.\nSkipper turns and meets the eyes of admiration, humility\nand complete respect.  He joins Alice at the helm.  They\nlinger for a moment.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          What'd he say?\n\nGeorge smiles, impressed as well.\n\n                         GEORGE\n          He told them real sailors need only\n          the stars.\n\nWith a new attitude, they turn to Skipper.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Alright then, let's get outta here.\n\nThe crew bolt to there positions.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          With staff and string he showed us\n          how to build a sextant.  As we rode\n          the trades, he shared the ancient\n          secrets of how to read the waves and\n          follow stars.  And some mornings\n          later, bathed in the orange glow of\n          a sunrise, Panama rose from the sea\n          like a phoenix.\n\n\nEXT.  ALBATROSS - PANAMA CANAL - DAY\n\nPanama appears on the horizon.  The Albatross is dwarfed\nby the huge freighters moored around her, as she moves\nthrough the locks.  The crew stand on deck in quiet\nreverence.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - NIGHT\n\nThe sounds of slumber fill the cabin.  All seems well with\nthe world.  Suddenly, silhouettes in the darkness.  A huge\nbearded figure stands in the center of the cabin with a\ntrident in his hand.\n\nChuck wakes with a start.  He bolts upright to see the\nhorrible figure of NEPTUNE himself (Lawford) towering\nbefore him.  He tries to scream, but hands cover his\nmouth.  He is dragged, struggling, up the companionway.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - NIGHT\n\nThe Albatross has been transformed into a ghost ship.\nWhere the sails once were, only shredded fabric.  All of\nthe crew have been brought on deck.  Powdered faces glow,\nsurreal.\n\nJohn's head has been shaved into a mohawk.  Robin, Rick\nand Chris have been reduced to crew cuts.  The shears\nstart over Chuck's head.  Neptune and his sidekick, DAVEY\nJONES (George) and two MERMAIDS (Bill and Alice) emerge\nwith the rest of the crew.\n\n                         NEPTUNE\n          Hold fast that polliwog and make him\n          presentable.\n\nChuck struggles as his hair is shaved away and face\npowdered.\n\n                         NEPTUNE\n          Let it be known that on this day in\n          the year nineteen hundred and sixty-\n          one there appeared within the limits\n          of my royal kingdom, the sailing\n          ship brigantine Albatross, bound for\n          Galapagos.  All vessels that sail my\n          domain shall be subject to the\n          scrutiny of the underworld...\n\nTerry is brought topside kicking and screaming.\n\n                         NEPTUNE\n          Silence!!!\n\nTerry shuts up and succumbs to the same fate as the rest.\n\n                         NEPTUNE\n          Tonight you shall all enter the\n          Order of the Shellbacks.  Only when\n          you have been duly initiated shall\n          you enjoy the mysteries and\n          protection of the trident.  So, let\n          the festivities begin...\n\n\nEXT.  HELM - NIGHT\n\nNeptune and his court sit smoking Havana cigars as each\nmember of the crew present themselves.  Robin dressed like\na pig and crawls around snorting.\n\nJohn's an Indian brave, whooping and hollering as he does\na rain dance.  Chuck, with flippers on his hands and feet,\nhops around like a frog.  Rick is in 'drag' as Neptune's\ngirlfriend and must sing everything he says.  Charlie is\ndressed like a sloth and slithers along the deck.\nFrenetic chaos.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - LATER\n\nNeptune and his court lead a procession around the\nperimeter of the deck.  The crew follows.  They stamp\ntheir feet and chant.\n\n                         ALL\n          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!\n          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!\n          Hell is to drift, heaven to steer!!\n\nThey move faster and faster around the boat.  They shout\nlouder and louder, faster and faster until they have all\nworked themselves into a frenzy.\n\n\nEXT.  BOW - DAWN\n\nDavey Jones, holds a large turtle shell over the crews\nheads.  As each one passes before him he pours blood from\nthe turtle shell onto their heads.  It runs down,\nstreaking their floured faces and necks.  As the ritual\nprogresses, Neptune speaks.\n\n                         NEPTUNE\n          By virtue of the power inherited by\n          me, I do hereby command all of my\n          subjects, such as mermaids, sea\n          serpents, dolphins, whales, sharks\n          and turtles, from eating, playing\n          with, or otherwise molesting this\n          vessel or her crew.  Let it be\n          remembered that on this, my\n          Equatorial Domain on Longitude 88'\n          20' 13\" on this 532nd in the year of\n          the dolphin, you entered the Order\n          of the Shellbacks!!\n\nThe crew cheer and embrace.  Skipper calls from the wheel.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Land ho!\n\n\nEXT.  GALAPAGOS ISLANDS - DAY\n\nThe crew stop their celebrating and gather at the port\nbow.  Ahead, glowing orange with the dawn, the islands of\nGalapagos.  It's desolate landscape of silent volcanoes\nand ancient lava flows that spill into the sea.\n\nThe faces of the boys, still streaked with the indignities\nof the night's ordeal, stand silently before their final\ndestination.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          We had journeyed over six thousand\n          miles to the very edge of the earth.\n          Like Darwin before us, we would\n          witness the bliss of nature in the\n          absence of man.  And it was as if\n          the Albatross had forded time,\n          leaving it behind.  In the heat of\n          those equatorial days, on the virgin\n          onyx beaches and shifting coral\n          dunes, one could expect to find\n          sunning iguanas, nesting frigates\n          and perchance... the footprints of\n          God.\n\n\nEXT.  BEACH - SHIPWRECK BAY - DAY\n\nThe Albatross rests at anchor.  On the beach, the crew\nwatch a huge group of penguins dive and frolic from the\nancient guano cliffs.  So unaccustomed are these creatures\nto man, that they have no fear.\n\n\nEXT.  LAGOON - DAY\n\nChuck, John and Rick snorkel among the playful SEA LIONS.\nThey dart and swim like otters among their new human\nfriends.\n\n\nEXT.  LAVA OUTCROPPING - DAY\n\nTerry, Chris, Chuck and Mike stand taking notes on exotic\nbirds.  Frigates, hawks, flamingos, pelicans, boobies, and\nof course... albatrosses.\n\n\nEXT.  ALBATROSS - DAY\n\nThe crew are sprawled across the deck taking final exams.\nAlice walks among them.  Chuck throws an anxious look\ntowards John who is buried in his test.\n\n\nEXT.  GRASSY LOWLANDS - DAY\n\nBoobies nest in the grass.  Thousands of them and\namazingly, the crew can walk among them without them\nbatting an eye.  Chuck and Robin watch as the iguanas\nsneak into unattended nests and steal eggs.\n\n\nEXT.  DUNES - DAY\n\nChuck is alone gazing over the shoreline.  A huge flock of\nfinches darken the sky, circling the black sand beach.\nPure magic.\n\n\nEXT.  BEACH - DAY\n\nBeyond, the anchored Albatross rocks and bounces in a\nblue-sky gale.  Chuck, John, Robin, Rick, Chris and Tod\nstand by a dory watching the sea build.  They wear only\ntattered shorts, their hair sun bleached and their skin\ndark.\n\n                         RICK\n          We're here for the night.\n\n                         TOD\n          Yeah.\n\n\nEXT.  ROCKS - SAME\n\nTight.  The eyes of predators.  Sharp, cunning, hungry.\n\n\nEXT.  BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY\n\nA lone wild goat grazes on the beach.  It looks up,\nsensing something, unfamiliar, then, returns to it's\ngrazing.\n\nTight.  Thundering bare feet on the black sand.\n\nThe goat looks up again, this time it sees five\nHomosapiens bearing down on him.  They come naked,\nswinging their shredded clothing above their heads like\nlassos.  Shouting, whooping, primal.  The goat bolts for\nits life.\n\nPounding through the waterline like the wild horses of\nSable, the hunters charge after the hunted, closing.  The\ngoat's eyes are full of a terror it has never known.\n\nThe beach is broad and long with no cover.  The hunters\nare gaining on the goat.  Splashing feet pound closer...\n\nSuddenly they are upon the goat.  But, instead of\nattacking it, they just run through it, passing it.  The\ngoat pulls up and stops, breathless, watching the naked\nhumans run.\n\nClose on the faces of brothers, matching each other, step\nfor step.  The music builds as we...\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\n\nEXT.  BEACH - NIGHT\n\nWild eyes behind the charcoal painted masks of primal man.\nThe rhythmic beat of sticks clacking and voices chanting.\nThe heaping of driftwood into piles.  Taught and powerful,\nthe glistening bodies of young men.\n\nBlue sparks leap from striking flint against stone.  A\nflame is born.  Voices howl in guttural triumph.\n\nAs the flames leap and singe the darkness, silhouettes of\nmen pound the sand and cry out in a ritualistic dance.\n\nThe goat watches from the shadows, bemused, as the dance\nbuilds to a frenzy.  The night sky is filled with the\nbuilding sound of raging fire, pounding surf and chanting\nvoices.\n\n\nEXT.  ALBATROSS - SAME\n\nThe wind carries the sounds of ceremony across the water.\nThe flames from the beach reflect off of the water turning\nthe white hull of the ship, a deep flickering orange.  The\nword A-L-B-A-T-R-O-S-S has been spelled in huge flaming\nletters.  Alice joins Skipper at his place by the rail\nwatching.\n\n                         ALICE\n          What are they doing?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Claiming their place in the world.\n\n\nEXT.  SHORELINE - DAWN\n\nThe white surf hisses as it washes among the cinders of\nthe evenings ritual.  The Galapagos have been returned,\nfor now, to the frigates and the iguanas.\n\nAcross the water against the rising sun, the Albatross,\nunder full sail, is bound for home.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - SAME\n\nThe crew stand at their posts.  The yards and foretop are\ntrimmed with sailors, their faces taught and their bodies\nhard.  No one looks back.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - PANAMA CANAL - DAY\n\nAlice steps onto the deck from the chart house with papers\nin her hands.\n\n                         ALICE\n          Well gentlemen, I have the results\n          of your college board scores.  I\n          think most of you will be pleased.\n\nThe crew members collect their exams.  Chuck notices John\nat the bow, alone, lost.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          You okay?\n\n                         JOHN\n          Yeah.

It's an 'A'!\n\n                         JOHN\n          I know.\n\n                         CHUCK\n                  (excited)\n          You know?  Then why are you up here\n          looking like you're about to jump\n          overboard?!\n\n                         JOHN\n          I just can't believe it.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          This is your moment, don't you see?\n          The instant when you know that your\n          life is never going to be the same\n          again.  When you stand up and are\n          counted.\n\nJohn tries to choke back his emotions.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I couldn't have done it without you.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Yes you could.  You did.\n                  (holding up the\n                   exam)\n          This is all you.  Nobody else.\n\nJohn looks out.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Thank you.\n\nChuck smiles and joins John's gaze over the water.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Feels different doesn't it?\n\n                         JOHN\n          What?\n\n                         CHUCK\n          That we're going back.

You're the thing that\n          holds everybody around you together.\n          You're strong, you listen and you\n          see things in people the rest of us\n          can't.  It's a gift.\n\nIt's Chuck's turn to fight emotion.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          You know, I never had friends like\n          this.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Me either.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          I feel like... we can do anything.\n\nJohn smiles, clutching his exam.\n\n                         JOHN\n          We can.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          In the fading hours of that Pacific\n          dusk, with nothing left to confess,\n          for the first time we felt safe,\n          capable, sure of who we were and\n          where we were going.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - DAWN\n\nThe crew sleep in their bunks.  Lawford's voice rumbles\ndown the companionway.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          A wet sheet and a flowing sea/ A\n          wind that follows fast, And fills\n          the white and rushing sail, And\n          bends the gallant mast/ Arise, arise\n          you salty dogs.  The watch is on.\n\nChuck, Tom, John, Terry and Tod roll out.  The dumb waiter\nclatters down from the galley with the morning's\nbreakfast.  Skipper and some of the crew are already\neating.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - DAY\n\nThe Albatross is under full sail trying to take advantage\nof what little wind there is.  The skies are gray and\ndank.  Tod and Terry are at the helm.  Chuck and John are\namid ship.  John relieves Bill on the forward watch.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Looks like we're gonna get wet.\n\n                         BILL\n          Well, we need it.  I want to take a\n          nice long bath and catch some water\n          for my laundry.\n\n                         JOHN\n          Save some for me will you?\n\n                         BILL\n          You got it.  I'm going below.\n\nSuddenly, a huge lightning bolt explodes out of the sky\nand strikes the water a hundred feet off of the starboard\nbeam.  Everyone jumps.\n\n                         TOD\n          Jesus!!\n\nSkipper bolts onto the deck.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Everybody okay?\n\nThe crew nod sheepishly.  A very close call.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          All hands keep out of the rigging\n          and stay clear of the masts.\n\nThe clouds grow dark but no more lighting.  Tod laughs\nnervously.  Everybody joins in.  It's contagious.  Even\nSkipper manages a smile.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          All right gentlemen.  Thor's had his\n          fun.  Let's keep a keen eye.\n\nSkipper starts back into the chart house when suddenly, a\npowerful gust of wind drives the ship hard to a 45 degree\nlist to the starboard.  Skipper stops and turns.\n\nInstinctively, John and Chuck spring for the rigging to\ndrop sail.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (sharply)\n          No!  Stay down!!\n\nSkipper stares at the sky with the intensity of a cobra.\nWaiting.  The wind eases.  It becomes eerily still.  The\nship slows and the sails go slack.  Silence.  Skipper\nmaintains his vigil.\n\nCLOSE ON WATER\n\nFoam and spray appear off of the tops of the swells like\nthe invisible footprint of a locomotive.  John sees it\nfirst.\n\n                         JOHN\n                  (shouting)\n          HERE IT COMES!!!\n\nEverybody turns and looks.  Skipper's eyes suddenly widen\nas he realizes...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (in a whisper)\n          White Squall!\n\nThe charging wall of wind slams into the topsails so hard\nit send a shudder throughout the ship.  The wheel is\nnearly ripped out of Tod's hands.  Instinctively, he tries\nto turn the ship into the wind.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Hard to starboard!!!  Hard to\n          starboard!!!\n\nConfused, panicked, Tod keeps turning to the left, into\nthe wind.  Skipper struggles to get to the wheel but when\nthe ship heals so badly he slides sideways across the\ndeck.\n\n                         TOD\n          No, hard to port!\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          TURN THE GOD DAMNED WHEEL TO THE\n          RIGHT!!!\n\nFinally, Tod does as he is told.  But as soon as the ship\nstarts to come about, the vicious wind drives her further\nonto her side.  As the deck becomes vertical Chuck half\nslips, half tumbles down to the starboard gunnel.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n\nRobin, Chris, Bill, Mike and Rick are seated at the table\nfinishing breakfast as the ship starts to go.  They all\nshare growing alarm as they watch the table reach it's\nmaximum angle.  Dishes start sliding off.\n\n                         BILL\n          Get out!!  Everybody out!!\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - SAME\n\nSkipper manages to grab the ax mounted on the chart house\nand cuts the mainsheet with a single blow.  But it's too\nlate.  The tall masts plunge into the ocean and the sails\nscoop tons of sea water, pinning the Albatross on her\nside.\n\n\nINT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME\n\nAlice struggles towards the door.  The book case tears out\nof the wall and strikes her.  She drops to her knees.  The\ndoor swings open in front of her.  She reels for a moment\nand then loses consciousness.\n\n\nINT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME\n\nLawford, Charlie and George are all hurled out of their\nbunks.  The world is suddenly sideways.  Lawford leaps up,\npushing the others towards the companionway ladder.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          GO, GO, GO!!!  TOPSIDE!!!  Come on\n          Charlie!  George, get them out!!\n\nGeorge disappears into the main cabin.  Lawford manages to\nget Charlie out.  As Lawford reaches the top of the ladder\nsea water explodes through the hatch and drives him back\ninto the bowels of the ship.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n\nRobin is through the companionway in the chart house with\nMike right behind him.  But instead of exiting, he holds\nthe door open against the sea so that Mike can escape.\n\nMike gets through the door before the rushing sea slams it\nclosed, pinning Robin's arm.  He struggles to push\nthrough.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - SAME\n\nJohn slashes at the lines securing the starboard lifeboat\nwith his knife and manages to free it before it is dragged\nto the bottom.  He scrambles through the collapsed rigging\ntangled above him for the port lifeboat.\n\nAT THE STERN\n\nThe Albatross is going down.  Fast.  Chuck and Tod stand\non the after skylight.  Chuck catches glimpses of the\nstruggle going on below.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          My God, they're drowning!\n\nSkipper catches a glimpse of Alice through the skylight.\nWater washes over her but she doesn't move.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Oh please, no.  Not this woman.\n\n\nINT.  SKIPPER'S CABIN - SAME\n\nSkipper's face is pressed hard against the skylight.  His\nmuffled voice penetrates the cabin.  Alice stirs.  She\nlooks around, delirious.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Alice, get up!!  Come on girl!!\n\nHe pounds uselessly on the teak deck then tears at the\nplanks, fingers bleeding.  Alice looks up confused but\ncalm and finds Skipper's eyes.\n\nON THE DECK\n\nPanicked for the first time in his life Slipper swings the\nax wildly at the perpendicular deck sending a shower of\nsplinters into the water.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Get out!!  Get out!!  Jesus Christ,\n          please God, Alice get out!!!\n\nBut after only two swings, the Albatross and Alice, slip\nbeneath the sea.\n\n\nINT.  MAIN CABIN - SAME\n\nWater thunders in from every possible exit.  Chris and\nRick push Bill towards the dumbwaiter.   \n\n                         RICK\n          Bill, you go.  We'll be right behind\n          you.\n\nBefore he can say no, Rick and Chris jam Bill into the\ntiny shaft.  Suddenly, from below, a tremendous geyser\nsmashes him to the top, knocking him unconscious.  But the\npressure is so great that the water sweeps him through the\ngalley and out onto the deck.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - SAME\n\nSkipper struggles to reach John and the second life boat\nbut sees that it is tangled in the rigging.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Johnny, it's not good.\n\nJohn defies him and keeps cutting.  The ship is almost\ncompletely submerged.\n\n                         JOHN\n          I can get it!\n\nSuddenly one of the deck lockers breaks free and plunges\ninto the water taking lines and rope with it.  John\nbecomes tangled and is dragged into the water.  Only his\nsuperior strength allows him to hold onto the lifeboat and\nkeep cutting.\n\nThe Albatross slips beneath the surface.  Instead of\ntrying to free himself John keeps slashing at the lifeboat\nlines as he disappears, swallowed by the sea.\n\n\nINT.  FORWARD COMPARTMENT - SAME\n\nEerie silence.  Lawford is trapped in an tiny air pocket.\nDebris float around.  He begins to panic as the water\naround him rises.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          My God!!  Oh God I'm dying!!!\n\nHe takes a deep breath and the water consumes him.  Then\nsuddenly, the ceiling above him explodes from the pressure\nwithin.\n\nON THE SURFACE\n\nLawford is catapulted from the grip of death, to the\nsurface.\n\n\nEXT.  SURFACE - SAME\n\nChuck continues to frantically dive on the chart house\ndoor as the ship takes the 'Deep Six'.  Suddenly the ship\nrolls 180 degrees, her screws exposed and keel jutting up\nlike a huge dorsal fin.\n\n\nEXT.  UNDERWATER - SAME\n\nChuck feels the ship coming down on top of him but still\nfinds Robin's arm.  They clasp tightly, but Chuck just\ncan't budge the door.  Then, strangely, Robin releases\nChuck's arm and pulls it back through the door.  Chuck\nlooks up, startled.  The small round window in the door is\nilluminated from the cabin lights on the inside.\n\nThrough the glass, Chuck meets Robin's frightened eyes.\nHe fights to stay in a shrinking air pocket.  Robin takes\na last gulp of air then, a calm comes over him.\n\nHe meets Chuck's eyes again but this time with a strange\nacceptance.  They both know what's happening.  But Robin\nhas refused to take his friend to the bottom with him.  He\npresses his hand to the glass.  Chuck does the same.  Then\nwith a smile, Robin pushes himself away from the door,\ndisappearing into the darkness and eternity.\n\n\nEXT.  SURFACE - SAME\n\nChuck breaks the surface, gasping for air.  He looks\naround, frantic.  He sees nothing but the sea swells and\ndebris.  All that remains is the sound of the wind and\nrain on the water.\n\nSuddenly, beneath him, a massive rumbling and explosion of\nfoam.  Then, the tops of twin masts rise out of the water\nlike shattered lances as the ship rights herself\nunderwater.  She holds herself steady for a moment as if\nin a final attempt at resurrection, the Albatross begins\nto rise.  Faster and faster, until her entire length\nexplodes out of the water in a mountain of foam and wave.\n\nON THE DECK\n\nLike Ahab before him, John appears, lashed in a web of\ntangled line still slashing to free the remaining long\nboat.\n\nAnd for a moment, it looks as if she might stay there, as\nif this were just a final surreal lesson of the sea.  Some\nof the boys begin to cheer prematurely.  But Skipper knows\nbetter.  She's filled to the gills with sea water.\n\nShe shutters.  Then, like a stone, she just drops, sucked\nto the center of the earth, John's hands still slashing,\nas she finally goes.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\nSurvivors hanging onto the debris that floats in the\nwatery tempest.  Strangely, the wind subsides.  The sea\nbecomes calm and a stunned silence falls over those in the\nwater.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          OH GOD!!!!!\n\nHis scream echoes, for the grief of all.\n\nON THE SURFACE\n\nThere is an explosion of bubbles, and then she slips\nbeneath the waves like a stone.  The stunned crew can only\nwatch.\n\nThen, as if by magic, the second life boat erupts to the\nsurface.\n\nSkipper fights off his emotions.  He knows what it means.\nJohn died cutting it free.\n\nTerry and Bill hang onto a life ring.  Blood runs from\nBill's head.  Charlie, Mike and several others hold onto\nthe side of the other freed life boat which has been\nswamped.  Lawford floats on his back, unconscious, but\nalive.  Several of the boys help pull him towards the\nboat.\n\nSkipper swims to the second boat, desperately looking for\nthose not accounted for.  But, they are gone.\n\nAmong the wreckage, the roof of the chart house.  The only\nsound left is the ominous tolling of the ship's bell,\nRobin's bell, still secure in it's fitting.\n\n\nEXT.  LIFE BOAT - DAY\n\nThe boats have been floated and tied together.  Skipper is\nin one, Lawford in the other.  One of the two boats has\nbeen rigged with sail.  Skipper stands in the bow staring\ninto the ink blue water.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Raise your sail, Bill.  North, north-\n          east.  Keep a sharp look out for\n          Florida.\n\nBill studies him for a moment, then...\n\n                         BILL\n          Maybe we could wait around a little\n          longer, sir...\n\nThere is a long pause before Skipper answers.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (quietly)\n          She's gone... She's gone.\n\nThere is something remarkably touching about this young\nman trying to take care of him.  He puts a hand on\nSkipper's shoulder.  It almost makes him crack.  He pats\nBill's hand gently.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Carry on.\n\n                         BILL\n          Yes sir.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          North, north-east.\n                  (beat)\n          And Dick, please make a note of our\n          final position.\n\nLawford nods sullenly.  Chuck looks out at the floating\nwreckage around them, silent, lost.\n\nSuddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat.  The\nsurvivors share a confused look.  Then it comes again.\n\nChuck looks out at the surface of the water.  It's\nsuddenly alive... With sharks.\n\n                         LAWFORD\n          Hands and feet inside the boats.\n\nThey come by the dozens.  Ramming the boats and rummaging\nthrough the debris.  They swarm around the boats until it\nseems as if the water is boiling.  Chuck picks up an oar\nand starts beating wildly at the sharks.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          AAAAHHHH!!!!\n\nThe others take up the cause and in a moment they are all\nscreaming and cursing the sharks.  It's a frenzy of grief\nand anger.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          We slashed at the sharks as if\n          striking out at the finger of God.\n          And we all begged silently for the\n          ability to understand what had\n          happened.  But, if there was a God\n          that day, his answer came only in\n          the moaning wind and our questions\n          were left to drift unanswered, in\n          the titanic ocean of our deepest\n          grief.\n\nExhausted, Chuck stops slashing and stares out.  lost.\n\n                         CHUCK\n                  (hushed)\n          Wake up.  Wake up.  1-2-3 wake up.\n\nLike Robin's nightmare of his brother, this is all too\nreal.\n\n\nEXT.  OCEAN - DAY\n\nThe tramp freighter GRAN RIO steams toward the life boats.\nThe crew stand silently, watching as the ship approaches.\n\n\nEXT.  SHIP - DAY\n\nChuck stands on the deck of the Gran Rio as the last of\nthe crew scramble up cargo netting hung over the side.\nChuck stares out numbly watching as the two deserted long\nboats drift away.\n\n\nEXT.  DECK - GRAN RIO - DAY\n\nChuck, now dressed, stands in the same spot at the rail,\nstaring out.  A muffled sound pulls Chuck into the\npresent.  He walks slowly down the after deck to a cabin\ndoor where sobbing escapes from the other side.  Chuck\nturns the handle and cracks the door.\n\n\nINT.  CABIN - SAME\n\nCurled up on the floor next to his bunk is Skipper.  A\nlook of shock comes over Chuck's face.  Skipper has come\ncompletely unglued, sobbing deeply.\n\n                         CHUCK\n                  (tentative)\n          Skipper?\n\nSkipper turns slowly, looking up.  His eyes are red and\nhis face streaked with tears.  He looks at Chuck almost as\nif he doesn't know who he is.  Lost.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.\n\nChuck reels.  It sounds more like a confession than an\noutpouring of sadness.  Chuck closes the door.\n\n\nEXT.  HARBOR - TAMPA FLORIDA - DAY\n\nSkipper, back in control, and the crew, stand along the\nport rail of the Gran Rio.  A small flotilla of pleasure\nboats surround the ship and hundreds of people line the\npier.  It's an intimidating sight.\n\nON THE PIER\n\nPensive, worried, angry faces of parents and families.\nChaos.

Skipper turns to his crew, looking over\nthem.  A smile of deep pride passes his lips.  They all\nsee it.  Then, between the Coast Guard Officers, he walks\ndown the ramp.  Lawford and the crew fall in behind.\n\n\nEXT.  PIER - SAME\n\nA shouting mob waits for them.  Reporters and spectators\nshout and call out questions.  It reaches a fever pitch as\nthe crew descend.

He looks up and sees himself\nin the mirror.  The eyes that look back are eyes of the\nages.  Involuntary sobs.  He begins to shake.  The tiny\nbooth suddenly like a crypt.  Tight, with no air.  Chuck\nlets out a gasp.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Oh God...\n\nSomeone pulls open the curtain.  A MAN, from the next\nbooth, fat and middle aged stands before Chuck in a pair\nof pants still sporting the price tags.

Chief petty officers Sanders and Downing\nask most of the questions as Tyler oversees the\nproceedings.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Why didn't you drop any sail?\n\n                         BILL\n          Skipper called us out of the\n          rigging.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          But your instinct was to lose sail?\n\n                         BILL\n          My instinct was to not get\n          electrocuted.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          How old are you, son?\n\n                         BILL\n                  (hesitating)\n          Fifteen.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Thank you.\n\nLATER\n\nPhil is at the table with Francis.  Sanders asks the\nquestions.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Philip, why were you discharged from\n          the Albatross?\n\nPhil doesn't look up and speaks in whispers.\n\n                         PHIL\n          Skipper thought I was a challenge to\n          authority.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Were you?\n\n                         PHIL\n          I don't know.\n\nLATER\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          Captain Sheldrake exhibited an\n          arrogant, controlling attitude in my\n          presence on more than one occasion.\n          I believe he had a personality\n          conflict with my son from the start.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Well, if you don't mind my asking,\n          sir, why did you let your son stay?\n\nFrancis is stumped for a moment but recovers quickly.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          It was his dream to go.  I could\n          hardly stand in the way of that,\n          could I?\n\nPhil rubs his temples as if he is going to explode.\n\n\nINT.  HEARING ROOM - LATER\n\nIt is Skipper's turn at the table.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Is it true that you forced Robin\n          Weathers to climb the mast when it\n          was clear that he was acrophobic.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          He climbed when he was ready.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Were you aware that his brother was\n          killed in a fall.\n\nChuck and the others look up astonished.  Mike shoots a\nlook towards Phil.\n\n                         MIKE\n          He did it man.  He sang like a bird.\n\nSkipper hesitates.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yes, I was.\n\nWhispers fill the room.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Sir, were you aware at any time of\n          the use of alcohol among the crew.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yes, I was.\n\n                         TYLER\n          And you didn't do anything about it?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (beat)\n          No.  I didn't.\n\nAgain the crew members are struck.  Charlie turns to\nChuck.\n\n                         CHARLIE\n          They're twisting it all around.  Why\n          doesn't he say something?\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Had you ever seen a \"White Squall\"\n          before this incident?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          No.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          What makes you so sure it was one?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          I can't be sure.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          You really felt that your crew were\n          up for the conditions.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          We'd come twelve thousand miles\n          together, through every kind of seas\n          imaginable...\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Except, a \"White Squall\".\n                  (beat)\n          With all due respect Captain\n          Sheldrake, they're only boys...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          They are much more than that, sir.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Is it true that the reason you\n          expelled Philip Boutillier...\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (cutting him off)\n          For killing a dolphin.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          ... and that you invited him to\n          strike you?  To fight it out on the\n          deck of your ship?!\n\nSkipper looks over at Francis.  Phil stares at the floor.\nSkipper manages an ironic smile.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yes, that's true.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Do you think this is funny?  Some\n          kind of joke?  You lost six people\n          out there.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (white hot)\n          I don't think one second of this is\n          funny, sir.\n\nSkipper stares down Sanders.  He turns to Tyler.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          I have no more questions at this\n          time.\n\nHe turns to sit down, then stops.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Oh, one last thing... Isn't true\n          that your father was a sea Captain?\n\nSkipper bristles.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Yes.\n\n                         SANDERS\n          Isn't also true that his vessel went\n          down off of Nantucket?  Lost\n          everyone on board.  In fair weather\n          no less.\n\nSkipper's silence is suddenly filled with rage.  Tyler\nsees it and tries to intercept.\n\n                         TYLER\n          What does this have to do with\n          anything Mr. Sanders?\n\n                         SANDERS\n                  (smug)\n          Oh, nothing.  I was just curious.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          My father, was more seaman, more of\n          a man, than you might ever hope to\n          be.\n\nSanders returns to his seat, rattled.  Tyler pounds his\ngavel.\n\n                         TYLER\n          We'll take a brief recess.\n\n\nEXT.  BUILDING - DAY\n\nThe crew huddle in the parking lot.  Fractured, confused.\nChuck, Tod, Charlie and Bill, stand off by themselves.\n\n                         TOD\n          There's still a way.\n\n                         BILL\n          What do you mean?\n\n                         TOD\n          It's me, don't you see.  Terry's\n          right, I'm the escape hatch.  I\n          disobeyed order.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          You taking the order wouldn't have\n          changed anything.\n\n                         TOD\n          They don't know that.\n                  (beat)\n          We were the only one's on deck.\n          Look, there's nothing they can do to\n          me right?  I'm a kid.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          But that's not the point...\n\n                         TOD\n          That is the point... And Skipper'll\n          slip off the hook.\n\nLATER\n\nTod is on the stand.\n\n                         DOWNING\n          Why didn't you turn hard to port as\n          the wind hit?\n\n                         TOD\n          I thought we'd have a better chance\n          if I headed into the wind so we\n          could spill air from our sails.\n\nTyler removes his glasses.\n\n                         DOWNING\n          But the Captain ordered you hard to\n          starboard.\n\n                         TOD\n          Twice.\n\n                         DOWNING\n          Is that what you were trained to do?\n\n                         TOD\n          No.\n\n                         DOWNING\n          Then what do you think he was trying\n          to do.\n\n                         TOD\n          Let the blow drive the boat down\n          wind.  Neutralize our canvas.\n\nSkipper is becoming uneasy.  He sees what is coming.\n\n                         DOWNING\n          So when the captain gave you an\n          order contrary to your training, you\n          thought he was making a mistake?\n\n                         TOD\n          No.\n\n                         TYLER\n          Then why son, why didn't you follow\n          his order?\n\nTod meets Skipper's eyes.\n\n                         TOD\n          Because -- I panicked.\n\nThe room is suddenly buzzing.  Tod's Father stands up.\n\n                         TOD'S FATHER\n          That's not true Tod.\n\n                         TERRY\n                  (to Mike)\n          What the hell?  What is he doing.\n\n                         MIKE\n          Son of a gun.  He just sent Skipper\n          a life boat.\n\nTyler turns to Skipper.\n\n                         TYLER\n          If this young man had responded\n          instantly to your command, do you\n          believe the ship might have been\n          spared?\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          I don't know that anything could\n          have prevented what happened.\n\n                         TYLER\n          Then what are you trying to say\n          then?\n\nSkipper stands.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          Maybe you can't see what's happening\n          here, but it's clear to me.\n                  (to Tod)\n          I appreciate what you're trying to\n          do Tod.  Maybe you could live with\n          it, but I couldn't.\n                  (to tribunal)\n          If you think I'm going to let a\n          sixteen year old take\n          responsibility, then you\n          underestimate me.  The Albatross was\n          my ship.  The Ocean Academy was my\n          school.  Her loss is mine and mine\n          alone.\n                  (to others)\n          I can't bring your sons back.  If\n          you want my ticket, if that will\n          ease your loss, it's the least I\n          can do.  This...\n\nSkipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          This is easy.  Living with it,\n          that'll be hard.\n\nSkipper turns and lays his license down in front of Tyler.\nThen he turns and begins walking towards the back of the\nroom.\n\nThe room erupts.  Crew members and their families hurl\naccusations and blame.  Cameras flash.  Tyler tries to\nregain control.  Suddenly Chuck stands, tall.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          No!!!  Don't you walk away!  Not\n          now.  Not after all of this!!!!\n\nSkipper keeps walking.  His head slumps.  Tyler pounds his\ngavel.\n\n                         TYLER\n          That enough son!!  Order!!  Please!!\n\nTears begin to stream down Chuck's face.  His father,\nCharles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes.  Go for it.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Tell me Skipper, was it all just a\n          lie?  \"Where we go one, we go all\".\n          We listened to you.  We believed it.\n          And we're still here!!\n\nSkipper keeps moving.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Shame on you then Skipper.  Shame on\n          you.\n\nSkipper reaches for the door.  Suddenly a sound stops him\ncold in his tracks.  Phil slowly rises.  Tears streaming\ndown his face.  Tightly in his hands he grips the ships\nbell.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  Ding ding.  It is the\nringing of the truth.  The tolling of their unity.\n\n                         FRANCIS\n          Sit down!\n\nPhil ignores him.  Skipper slowly walks over, his eyes\nnever leaving Phil's.  He stops, facing him.  He gently\ntakes his hands and silences the bell.  Then he smiles and\nputs a hand on the back of Phil's head fighting his own\nemotions.  He turns to Chuck.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Tell them the truth.  Make them\n          understand.\n\nThe room grows silent.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n                  (smiling)\n          You tell them Chuck.\n\nChuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          It's simple.  Bad things happen\n          sometimes.  It wasn't Skipper or\n          Tod.  It was all of us.  Everyone in\n          this room.  Because we all knew the\n          risks.\n                  (to parents)\n          You sent us... You paid our tuition,\n          you allowed us to go.  So to invent\n          a reason for why this happened, to\n          pin it on one person, well that\n          won't change anything.  It'll just\n          make our experience meaningless.\n\nHe turns to the tribunal.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          If you want to judge this man, judge\n          him by his crew.  Judge him by Alice\n          and George.  Chris and John and\n          Robin.  In one way or another each\n          one of them gave their lives saving\n          one of us.  This may sound crazy but\n          the Albatross wasn't just a ship, or\n          even a school.  It was something\n          that we made, that's inside us.\n          That's who Skipper is.  That's what\n          he taught us.  I guess what it\n          really was about was... the\n          privilege of sacrifice.\n\nChuck turns to Skipper.\n\n                         CHUCK\n          Isn't that right?\n\nSkipper nods.\n\n                         SKIPPER\n          That's right.\n\nThe room is silent.  Then, a voice.  A golden tenor\nsinging like the wind.  Everyone turns.  It's Bill.\n\n                         BILL\n          When the sun came up, there was\n          whisky in the cup, and not a one of\n          us was sober...\n\nOne by one the crew members stand and begin to sing.\nChuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand\nwith him.  Words or not.\n\n                         CREW TOGETHER\n          Jenny thought she saw a picture when\n          it really was the sun, then we knew\n          the party was over.\n\nThey all stand facing Skipper and sing.  The voices build,\nsweeping over everyone like a wave.\n\n                         CREW TOGETHER\n          Oh my heart is sad, for leaving you\n          today, but I know we'll meet again,\n          when the moon is in the valley and\n          the leafs are on the trees, We will\n          come to clearly in the glen...\n\nSkipper meets Chuck's eyes and those of his mates.  Only\nnow is his job finished.  He beams back.  The music swells\nlike an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small\nwooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in\nthe calm waters beyond.\n\nThe crew come together around Skipper one last time.  They\nembrace.\n\n\nEXT.  MYSTIC SEAPORT - HARBOR - DAY\n\nOlder Chuck has returned to the small building where the\nfuneral services were held earlier.  The people have gone\nbut the funeral urn remains.\n\n\nEXT.  PIER - DAY\n\nChuck walks to the dock.  He has the funeral urn in his\nhands.  He steps aboard a small sailboat and begins\nuntying her.  The HARBOR MASTER notices and steps out of\nhis office.\n\n                         HARBOR MASTER\n          What do you think you're doing.\n\nHe walks over to the dock.\n\n                         HARBOR MASTER\n          All right friend, out of the boat.\n\nHe tries to board the boat but Chuck greets him with the\nsharp end of a gaffing hook.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK\n                  (softly)\n          Stand away.\n\nHe looks into Chuck's eyes and sees that he means\nbusiness.  He backs off.  Chucks pushes away and raises\nthe sail.  The harbor master watches, perplexed as the\nsmall boat moves off for open water.\n\n\nEXT.  OPEN SEA - SUNSET\n\nBathed in the orange glow of the sun, Chuck stands naked\nagainst the ivory sail.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          They didn't take his ticket that\n          day.  But why he never returned to\n          the sea, I'd never know.  Perhaps he\n          hadn't been able to free himself\n          from the anchor of grief that had\n          driven him to his knees aboard the\n          Gran Rio, or that he no longer cared\n          for the solitude and isolation of\n          command without his Alice.  Or maybe\n          it was just that the waves that had\n          spoken to him for so long, had grown\n          silent.  Whatever it was, that\n          thing, it had always troubled me.\n          Because, fate offers up no reasons.\n          And maybe that's what I have\n          traveled these thirty four years to\n          say.  Maybe that is all I really\n          know... And, that one man cared.\n\nChuck turns to the sea and speaks.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK\n          Rest easy old salt.  For together\n          again, we'll sail.\n\nWith a powerful heave, he hurls the Skipper's remains at\nthe sinking sun and into the arms of Neptune.\n\n                                            DISSOLVE TO:\n\nEXT.  BEACH - SUNSET\n\nThe same sunset, but from another time.  Four young men\nwalk along a deserted beach.  A small boat has beached and\nrocks gently in the shallows.  The boys run up and look at\nit.  On the stern are painted the words:  BRIGANTINE\nALBATROSS.\n\nSLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal endless white sand, blue water,\nthe young men and the boat.\n\n                         OLDER CHUCK (V.O.)\n          Some time later we learned that one\n          of our long boats had been\n          recovered.  Several young men found\n          it washed up on a nameless beach\n          somewhere on the island of\n          Hispaniola.  No one seemed to know\n          who they were or where they came\n          from, but they seemed to know of the\n          Albatross.\n                  (pause)\n          Sometimes in my dreams those\n          faceless young men reveal themselves\n          as my lost companions, and on the\n          twilight coral sands of forever,\n          between my slumber and conscious\n          state, we race naked again, so open\n          and in love with those precious\n          moments, running, ever laughing,\n          ever young, ever free.\n\n                                            SLAM CUT TO:\n\nEXT.
