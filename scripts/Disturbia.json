Another beam RIPS FREE of\n    its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the\n    door and right front fender allowing\n\n    HIS FEET\n\n    to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath.

Kale's feet SLIP off the\n    rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the\n    top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching\n    Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM\n    CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.\n\n    JEFF'S WRIST\n\n    slips from Kale's grasp.

He's not smiling. Whatever chance we\n     had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly\n     fizzles. Another beat, then -- Julie pushes her chair back,\n     heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse.\n\n                              JULIE (CONT'D)\n                      (heading out)\n                  Do the dishes.\n                      (pleading)\n                  Please?\n\n     Julie leaves. Kale glances around the kitchen.       A mess of\n     dirty dishes, stacks of paper... screw that.\n\n17   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER                                    17\n\n     Kale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his TV\n     pulled out from the wall. He's behind it, meticulously\n     checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable.\n     Carefully studying the manual as he goes.\n\n     He blows on the Halo 2 CD, wipes it down with his sweatshirt,\n     gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might\n     not be his first attempt at this.\n\n\n                                                   (CONTINUED)   D.J.

SERVER ERROR.\n\n     Kale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor.\n     Rips the controller cord out of the XBOX --\n\n18   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING                               18\n\n     A few stray beams of sunlight pierce the blinds. Otherwise,\n     it's a tomb. Clothes strewn everywhere. We TRACK ACROSS\n     the floor and a virtual DEBRIS FIELD of junk food bags,\n     wrappers, Mountain Dew cans... find Kale in bed, ankle and\n     bracelet stick out from the sheets, arm hangs over the side --\n\n19   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                               19\n\n     Still a mess as we find Kale, hair disheveled, rummaging\n     through the cabinets. Lots of Costco-size boxes: crackers,\n     Pringles... a HUGE BOX OF TWINKIES. Kale spots a jar of\n     peanut butter. He grabs the nearest bowl, pulls a bottle of\n     Hershey's syrup from the fridge, pours it all into the bowl.\n\n     He's about to throw the syrup bottle in the trash when\n     something in the bottom of the can catches his eye. He\n     reaches in, pulls out a bill for XBOX LIVE: SUBSCRIPTION\n     CANCELED.\n\n20   INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                           20\n\n     Kale lounges in on the couch watching \"The Price is Right\"\n     as he spoons the peanut butter from the jar, dips it in the\n     bowl of chocolate syrup, devours it. Brings up a two-liter\n     of Mountain Dew, takes a big swig to wash it down.\n\n                              KALE\n                      (to contestant on TV)\n                  C'mon, bid a dollar, one dollar --\n\n                              CONTESTANT (ON TV)\n                  I'll bid one dollar, Bob.\n\n     Kale belches as he raises his spoon, saluting the screen.\n     Then, after a beat, a look of grave concern crosses his face --\n\n21   INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE BATHROOM - DAY                              21\n\n     The toilet flushes O.S. Kale opens the door, leans against\n     the frame, spent. He stands there a beat, absorbing the\n     silence of the house. He eyes a door at the end of the hall.\n\n22   INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - DAY - SECONDS LATER          22\n\n     CU - the doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns\n     it.

Ornate, cherry wood desk.     Plush leather\n     chairs. Quiet.\n\n     ON THE DESK -- dad's reading glasses sit on a stack of papers\n     next to an antique typewriter.\n\n     THE WALLS -- adorned with framed, poster-size covers of Dad's\n     books - non-fiction, true account titles: WHISTLEBLOWER -\n     The Inside Story of a Real Corporate Insider; THE SENATOR'S\n     SHADOWS: How Eight Men Conspired to Control One.\n\n     ON ANOTHER WALL -- a family portrait of Jeff, Julie, and\n     Kale - age six; Jeff at a book signing, smiling wide...\n\n     Kale takes it all in from the doorway. His feet never once\n     cross into the room. His eyes say everything. Loss, anger,\n     regret. He gently pulls the door shut.\n\n23   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT                                       23\n\n     Kale samples some rap clips on I-tunes.    Likes what he's\n     hearing.\n\n     ON THE SCREEN - Kale moves the cursor to \"buy song.\" The\n     account screen pops up. Kale types his password.\n\n     After a beat, bold red letters pop up: \"THE APPLE ID OR\n     PASSWORD YOU ENTERED WAS INVALID OR INCORRECT...\" Kale types\n     it again. Same thing. Then -- like we all do to be sure,\n     Kale types his password at a rate of ONE KEY PER SECOND.\n     Same thing. Kale fumes, smelling a rat.\n\n24   INT.

Find Kale\n     looking utterly miserable, lounging in bed watching \"Bikini\n     Destinations\" on HD NET. Julie enters wearing a business\n     suit and name badge emblazoned with the RE/MAX LOGO.

Then -- keeping his feet planted\n     in what looks to be a very practiced maneuver, he suddenly\n     falls forward against the mailbox. Reaches around with his\n     free hand, opens the door, going to grab the mail inside\n     just as\n\n     ASHLEY\n\n     pulls the car into and up the drive.

Kale struggles under\n     his own weight, trying to keep his feet from crossing the\n     line -- he looks back to Ashley who's now heading toward\n     him.

He grabs the tape\n     out of the camera, buries it in his closet, pulls out his\n     racketball trophy then creeps to the door, peers out --\n\n     KALE'S POV - The hallway's empty.

Pockets the ball,\n      slips the racket in the back of his shorts, then grabs the\n      baseball bat as he heads for the bookshelves near the door\n      that leads to the outside porch.

It slides away down the roof as Kale\n      doubles over. But Giles grabs Kale before he can fall. He\n      pulls Kale up off his feet, pulls him closer, gets in his\n      face. Kale summons some strength, tilts his head up and\n      HEADBUTTS GILES.\n\n      Giles stumbles back, pulling Kale with him. Giles SLAMS\n      down on the roof.
