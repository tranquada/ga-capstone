CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN\n\n               Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the \n               elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it \n               races north across the river past ancient factories giving \n               way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the \n               dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life \n               in the morning.\n\n               On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding \n               up their night on the town.\n\n               The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and \n               fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks.\n\n               A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, \n               Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center.\n\n               At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up \n               two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               The el train RUMBLES north past the aging tenements of Uptown \n               into the Belmont Avenue Station.\n\n               And down below, a garbage truck is slowly working its way up \n               the alley. A garbage man in city overalls WHISTLES to the \n               driver and the truck stops. He rolls a can to the grinding \n               jaw as the driver sits, tense and alert, scanning the street.\n\n               There's something odd about this driver. And the garbage man \n               too, for that matter.\n\n               EXT. EL PLATFORM - DAY\n\n               SPIDER, a nervous looking black man, steps out onto the \n               platform. As the train pulls away we see him reach into his \n               shirt pocket and CLICKS his ball point pen a couple of times. \n               He WHISPERS into it. It is a concealed radio transmitter.\n\n                                     SPIDER\n                         Say, hey, Cub fans, I hope to hell \n                         y'all down there cause we got a big \n                         game today.\n\n               He heads for the stairs and the street below.\n\n               INT. TRUCK CAB - DAY\n\n               The truck cab is equipped with a police radio. The driver, \n               RICH DONATO, adjusts the volume. Over the SPEAKER, HEAVY \n               WITH STATIC, we can hear the SOUND of the RECEDING EL TRAIN.\n\n                                     SPIDER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         The school bus be waitin.\n\n               Donato motions for the garbage man.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               EDDIE CUSACK jumps up on the truck's running board and sticks \n               his head in. On the seat beside Donato is a sledgehammer and \n               a sawed off automatic rifle. The two men stare at each other \n               as they concentrate on the CRACKLING RADIO.\n\n                                     SPIDER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         S'happenin, Doc?\n\n                                     DOC (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Hey, I got it all right here, my \n                         man. Jus be waitin on you.\n\n                                     SPIDER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         We ain't got far to go.\n\n               EXT. EL STATION - DAY\n\n               DOC is at the wheel of a late model Cadillac. Spider gets in \n               and they pull slowly away from the curb.\n\n               EXT. EL STATION - DAY\n\n               At the corner in a beat up Pontiac are officers MUSIC and \n               BRENNAN. The two rough looking detectives follow Doc's car \n               through half closed eyes.\n\n               They also HEAR Spider's TRANSMITTER. The quality of the \n               reception improves as Spider and his antennae clear the steel \n               support structure of the el platform.\n\n                                     DOC (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         This early bird shit just ain't my \n                         style.\n\n                                     SPIDER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Dig it. Too close to real work for \n                         me.\n\n               Doc and Spider talk in a nervous false bravado.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Eddie nods to Donato who grabs a walkie-talkie from the seat.\n\n                                     DONATO\n                              (to walkie-talkie)\n                         O.K.

Eddie looks at Donato.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Where's Cragie?\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Two cops are against the wall separating the cemetery from \n               the El. CRAGIE, a weathered twenty-five year veteran; and \n               NICK KOSALAS, the new kid on the team. Cragie sits on a crate \n               with a styrofoam cup of coffee.\n\n               Kosalas is trying to maneuver his cup lid off, and still \n               hold on to his walkie-talkie.\n\n                                     DONATO (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Talk to me left field.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                              (to mike)\n                         Ready sir. Left Field in position.\n\n               Cragie pulls a pint of whiskey from his pocket and sweetens \n               his coffee with a healthy shot. He notices Kosalas, who has \n               set down the thermos and is nervously moving from leg to \n               leg.\n\n                                     CRAGIE\n                         Have a shot, kid. A little nerve \n                         tonic.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         What's the matter with you?\n\n               Cragie grins and raises his cup to drink. His hand shakes \n               and he has to steady it with the other.\n\n               The RADIO CRACKLES.\n\n                                     SPOTTER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         O.K., guys, runner on first base.\n\n               INT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               A spotter, KOBAS, covers the scene from an abandoned building \n               across the street.\n\n                                     KOBAS\n                              (to walkie-talkie)\n                         Just turning on Paulina.\n\n                                     EDDIE (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Double Play, you got him in sight?\n\n                                     MUSIC (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Yeah, we got the on him. He's headin \n                         for the alley.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Eddie wrestles another garbage can into the truck's hopper \n               as Doc's car cruises slowly past.\n\n               Eddie and Spider LOCK EYES for a split second.\n\n               The car moves on and stops at the far end of the alley. The \n               lights switch off. After a moment, Spider and Doc leave the \n               car and check out the scene. Doc carries a satchel.\n\n                                     DOC (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         I say nice and simple now.\n\n                                     SPIDER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         We real cool, Doc.

Ain't no big thing.\n\n               The two men slip into the back gate of an old tenement. They \n               pass through a gangway to the front of the building, and \n               climb the front stairs.\n\n               Though we can no longer see them, we HEAR a DOOR OPENING, a \n               GREETING in Spanish, and FEET FOUNDING up the steps.\n\n               The garbage truck GRINDS forward and halts again. Eddie comes \n               up to the cab. He is wearing a gun under his overalls. He \n               and Donato listen on the RADIO to the CONVERSATION coming \n               from inside the building.\n\n               INT. COMACHO FRONT STAIRS - DAY\n\n               A muscular Latino, POMPAS COMACHO, leads Spider and Doc down \n               the paint-peeling corridor. The SOUND of BABIES CRYING and \n               FAMILIES WAKING gives a sense of teeming humanity behind \n               every door.\n\n               The Latino knocks at a door heavily fortified with burglar \n               bars. The door opens. The bars are unlocked.\n\n                                     SPIDER\n                         How y'all doin?\n\n                                     VOICE (V.O.)\n                              (from within)\n                         It's O.K.

COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Doc and Spider enter. They're patted down.\n\n               A sleepy eyed Latino woman comes to stand in the bedroom \n               doorway. VICTOR COMACHO barks at her in Spanish, and she \n               disappears into the bedroom.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Eddie stands on the running board of the truck with Donato \n               at the wheel.

VICTOR COMACHO \n               and TWO COUSINS, all young and vicious, are sitting around a \n               formica table with the two buyers, Doc and Spider. The \n               Comachos are heavily armed. There is plenty of tension all \n               around, but Doc seems a little more nervous than the rest.\n\n               This is an enormous buy. Doc has placed a bowling satchel \n               full of bundled $20's, $50's, and $100's on the table. Victor \n               is counting it rapidly.\n\n                                     SPIDER\n                         This be better than jukin' Seven-\n                         Elevens, huh Victor?\n\n                                     VICTOR\n                              (to cousins in Spanish)\n                         This one's got some balls, huh?\n                              (to Spider)\n                         I don't juke anybody.\n\n               Victor nods and one of the cousins brings in half a dozen \n               brick-sized bundles of cocaine from the next room.\n\n               Doc slices into one of the bags and with the tip of his knife \n               he drops a bit into a glass vial. He adds clear liquid with \n               an eye dropper and it instantly turns purple.\n\n                                     DOC\n                         I say, awright. The royal colors.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Eddie's eyes scan the scene as he sorts through a garbage \n               can with a stick.\n\n               INT. PAINTER'S HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               The painters carry their equipment down the long corridor \n               and enter a vacant apartment.\n\n               A door opens in the corridor, and a naked toddler steps out. \n               A Latino teenager comes out to retrieve the child. He sees \n               the backs of the painters, and carries the toddler back \n               inside.\n\n               INT. PAINTER'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               The painters are not what they seem. Working quickly, \n               silently, they open their tool kits and lay out their \n               hardware: machine guns and automatics.\n\n               TONY LUNA, a barrel-chested Italian mobster is running the \n               show and it's well rehearsed. His boys, GUS, VITO, and EENIE \n               move like oiled machinery.\n\n               Vito turns on a radio to a Latino station to cover the SOUND \n               of their preparations. They remove the whole window from its \n               frame. Then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge.\n\n               Three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and \n               silhouetted against the shade we can SEE the drug deal.\n\n               Luna'ys check their weapons.\n\n               They put on painters' masks and goggles.\n\n                                     LUNA\n                         Okay, by the numbers.\n\n               He puts on his goggles.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Over the IDLING ENGINE of the garbage truck, Eddie and Donato \n               HEAR the deal going down on the RADIO.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (to walkie-talkie)\n                         Everybody on your toes.\n\n                                     MUSIC (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         Their Right Field's Clear.

That building's gonna be \n                         condemned!\n\n               Like a coiled spring, Eddie leaps from the truck and runs \n               for the rear gate, gun in hand.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (shouts)\n                         Play Ball!

Two of \n               them hold sawed off double barreled shotguns. Tony counts it \n               down, and they all fire as one.\n\n               One GIANT BLAST tears into the window. It disintegrates.\n\n               The four men toss aside their empty guns, and grab other \n               guns.\n\n               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY\n\n               Eddie HEARS THE GUNFIRE and hits the wall. He sees the glass \n               showering down around him. He vaults over the backyard fence \n               and head for the porch stairs.\n\n               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY\n\n               Kosalas is finally pissing against the wall.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         I knew it.\n\n               Cragie is using the crate to climb the wall. He is up and \n               over, and falls to the ground on the other side. He's still \n               trying to get to his feet when Kosalas comes over.\n\n               They start running, yanking their guns out.\n\n               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Doc and Spider are blown backwards in their chairs. One of \n               the cousins has fallen across the piles of money and drugs. \n               Victor and the other cousin are slumped on the floor. The \n               woman in the bedroom is screaming.\n\n               Through the jagged glass around the window frame, Tony's \n               boys shove a broad plank.\n\n               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY\n\n               Three floors up, we see the \"painters\" rush across the gangway \n               to the other building.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY\n\n               EFREN COMACHO, the heavyweight guarding the back door, is \n               distracted by the SHOUTS and GUNFIRE upstairs. Eddie crashes \n               through the door and Efren spins just in time to meet Eddie's \n               blurring attack.\n\n               The struggle on the landing is brief. Efren's size is no \n               match for Eddie's speed and power. With a grunt he sags to \n               the floor.\n\n               Eddie leaps over him and bounds up the steps.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY\n\n               Brennan, Music and Kobas are now on their way, using parked \n               cars to cover their advance toward the front door of the \n               Comacho building.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY\n\n               Eddie passes the second floor landing and takes a quick look \n               up the porch stairs. The door to the second floor apartment \n               starts to open behind him. He spins and kicks it.\n\n               There stands a terrified old woman looking up the barrel of \n               his gun.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (shouts)\n                         Police! No se mueve!\n\n               He spins and bounds up the stairway.\n\n               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               The woman is huddled in a corner, still screaming. Tony comes \n               to stand over her, and coldly shoots her. Then he rips off \n               his mask and goggles as his boys clear the bodies and scoop \n               up the drugs and money from the table.\n\n               Victor Comacho lies slumped against the wall, one side of \n               his face and one shoulder bloodied. He appears dead, eyes \n               open. But then he blinks once.\n\n               INT. COMACHO BACK STAIRS - DAY\n\n               Eddie has entered the rear of the apartment. He moves \n               cautiously forward.\n\n               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Tony and his partners start back over the gangway to the \n               other building. Vito is bringing up the rear.\n\n               Suddenly Victor Comacho comes to life. He gets off A BURST \n               with his AUTOMATIC. Vito catches it in the back.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Donato is moving down the gangway when Vito's body -- followed \n               by the scaffold plank -- falls from the sky and CRASHES into \n               the pavement right in front of him.\n\n               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               Eddie jumps into the living room doorway, gun drawn, and \n               takes in the carnage. He kicks the gun out of Victor's hand, \n               and bounds to the shattered bay window and looks down in \n               time to SEE --\n\n               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY\n\n               Donato jumps over the broken body, running through the gangway \n               toward the front of the building.\n\n                                     DONATO\n                         They're goin out the front!\n\n               INT. COMACHO APARTMENT - DAY\n\n               The bridge to the other building is gone, but there is a \n               large drainpipe running down the outside of the building. \n               Eddie climbs out on the shattered window sill, and stretches \n               for the pipe. The pipe is just out of reach. Pushing off \n               from the ledge, he jumps for the drainpipe, grabbing it on \n               his way down.\n\n               EXT. DRAINPIPE - DAY\n\n               As he slides down three stories.\n\n               INT. PAINTER'S HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               The painters run down the stairs toward the front of the \n               building.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY\n\n               Music, Brennan, and Kobas rush the front door of the Comacho's \n               building, and enter.\n\n               EXT. GANGWAY - DAY\n\n               Eddie lands on his feet and heads for the front.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Cragie and Kosalas brace themselves on each side of the rear \n               door to the Painters' building. Cragie is white with fear. \n               Kosalas kicks in the door. They enter.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY\n\n               At the front of the building Donato emerges from the \n               passageway and he's met by a HAIL of GUNFIRE. He jumps back \n               and takes a more cautious look.\n\n               Tony Luna and Gus make a run for the van. Donato steps out \n               from between the two buildings and raises his gun.\n\n               But he hasn't seen Eenie, just coming out of the building \n               next door.\n\n               Eenie fires and Donato goes down, wounded in the foot. But \n               before Eenie can get off another shot --\n\n               -- Eddie leaps from the gangway and drops Eenie with a BURST \n               from his AUTOMATIC.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY\n\n               Luna pulls out PEELING RUBBER, but he's nearly surrounded. \n               squad cars have pulled in blocking both ends of the street. \n               Another squad car screeches to a halt and both officers jump \n               out and start firing.\n\n               Luna hits the fender of the squad car head on, knocking both \n               officers to the ground. He spins the van around with cops \n               FIRING from every angle, jumps the curb, and roars past the \n               roadblock on the sidewalk with pedestrians leaping in all \n               directions.\n\n               INT.

PAINTER'S HALL - DAY\n\n               A door opens behind Cragie. He whirls and FIRES into the \n               darkness.\n\n               The riddled body of a Mexican teenager, eyes wide with shock, \n               pitches into the hall.\n\n               Kosalas, down the hallway, hugs the wall, petrified.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Cragie?!\n\n                                     CRAGIE\n                         It's O.K. I got the sonovabitch.\n\n               Kosalas creeps ahead, gun drawn, just in time to see Cragie \n               pull a small handgun from his pocket and lay it in the boys \n               hand.\n\n               Cragie looks up at Kosalas and their eyes meet.\n\n               EXT. COMACHO STREET - DAY\n\n               Luna's van, it's windshield shot out, takes the first corner \n               on two wheels. Behind him the police scramble for their blue \n               and whites. Half way down the block, the van lurches into an \n               alley.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               The van hurtles down the alley, splashing through puddles \n               past the loading docks of a packing company. Parked along \n               one side of the end of the alley is a meat truck from the \n               opening montage. A loading ramp leads to the gaping rear \n               doors.\n\n               The thieves have done their homework. The Luna gang slams up \n               the ramp into the rear of the meat truck.\n\n               A bee fy compatriot in a blood stained butcher's smock pulls \n               several sides of beef along the rail and into the truck. \n               With the van concealed, the line of police cars ROAR splashing \n               by.\n\n               INT.

Cragie and \n               Kosalas look up.\n\n               Eddie appears at the front of the hall, gun drawn.

EDDIE'S CAR - DAY\n\n               Eddie and Kosalas are parked on an airport access road, \n               watching private planes land and take off. Eddie's car, a \n               five-year old Chevy, is wreckage. The quarter panels are \n               rusted, the radio antenna is a coathanger, and when Kosalas \n               pushes a tape into the cassette player, the windshield wipers \n               start moving.\n\n               Kosalas pops the cassette out, the windshield wipers stop; \n               he throws the cassette into the glove compartment. But now \n               he can't get the door to stay closed.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         I'm going to have to fix that.\n\n               Eddie has to shout to be heard over the sound of an airplane \n               passing directly overhead.\n\n               Eddie glances at Kosalas who looks uncomfortable.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         You know, it's kind of interesting. \n                         That 16 year old in the hallway with \n                         the gun? Partida told me he doesn't \n                         have a record. The kid's never been \n                         arrested.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Yeah, well, you know, if you read \n                         the papers, cops only shoot honor \n                         students.

LUIS COMACHO, a cruel and uncompromising \n               survivor, has arrived. With him is an incredibly beautiful \n               exotic woman.\n\n               He is met by Pompas and Efren Comacho, the two lookouts who \n               survived the raid. And Victor Comacho, who was wounded in \n               the raid, is here with his shoulder bandaged.\n\n               EXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY\n\n               From where Eddie and Kosalas are standing it is impossible \n               to hear the conversation at the Learjet, but it is clear \n               that Luis Comacho is upset. They see Luis slap Pompas and \n               Efren. Then he grabs Victor by both arms, ignoring his wound, \n               and screams at him.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Nice fellow this Luis Comacho.

He is bent over the space heater, tearing it apart.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         You look like shit.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Thanks, pal.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         They had a shot on the tube of you \n                         guys comin' out in front of the \n                         building. How's Donato?\n\n               Eddie collapses on the sofa.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Pissed cause he lost a shoe.\n                              (pause)\n                         Luis Comacho is in town.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         He'll collect himself some scalps \n                         before this one's over. Your answering \n                         machine is on the fritz again. Some \n                         woman with a fantastic voice was \n                         callin' about comin' over this weekend \n                         ta help you with somthin', and then \n                         the tape went nuts.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Want somthin' to drink?\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         Does the Pope shit in the woods?

Eddie gets up and the kid tosses \n               him the Rubic's Cube -- all done.\n\n               Eddie looks at it, and the kid goes into the kitchen.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         I hate smart ass kids.\n\n               Odell laughs.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         Gonna get down in the 30's tonight. \n                         Your pilot light is out.\n\n               Eddie tosses the Cube into the waste basket and opens the \n               refrigerator.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         I've been told that more than once.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                              (seriously)\n                         So, who you figure pulled out the \n                         rug? Gypsies? Mob?\n\n               Eddie comes back into the living room, hands a beer and a \n               soda to Odell, and flops back on the sofa with his own beer.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Somebody knew what they were doin'. \n                         They blew the top off an anthill.\n\n               Pirelli reaches for his drink and Odell hands him the soda. \n               Pirelli grabs the beer before Odell can drink and switches.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         I'd figure the Mob but Scalese ain't \n                         that stupid.\n                              (pause)\n                         Hah! Sombody put the valve in \n                         backwards.\n\n               Pirelli and Odell turn to Eddie who tries to look innocent -- \n               but fails. Eddie purposefully studies the answering machine \n               on the coffee table in front of him.\n\n                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                         Odell!

It spews \n               tape across the table.\n\n                                     PIRELLI\n                         Machines just don't like you.\n\n               Pirelli grabs the machine, unplugs it, and carries it out \n               the door toward his own apartment.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Maybe I don't like machines.\n\n               EXT. SOLDIER FIELD - DAY\n\n               The machine in question looks like a miniature tank. This is \n               the \"Prowler,\" a robot anti-terrorist vehicle that is being \n               maneuvered around various obstacles in a demonstration for \n               the city's law enforcement agencies.\n\n               The \"Prowler\" is amazingly agile. And its BULLHORN VOICE \n               breaks everybody up.\n\n                                     VOICE\n                              (from speaker)\n                         Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not \n                         move! No se mueve!...\n\n               The machine's three video eyes, searching the crowd \n               independently, give it the appearance of an extra-industrial \n               bug. One camera is mounted on a telescoping mast which extends \n               to give it the perspective of a giraffe. The thing seems \n               almost alive.\n\n               Commander Kates is here, leading a contingent of departmental \n               brass. With them are several dozen officers and a gaggle of \n               city councilmen.\n\n               The Prowler is being put through its paces by the FACTORY \n               ENGINEER. He controls the machine with a pistol-grip device \n               that looks like a small TV camera.\n\n                                     ENGINEER\n                         ...After the gyros are locked, any \n                         movement of the hand controller is \n                         duplicated by the 'Prowler.'\n\n               He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler, 50 yards \n               away, sweeps its turret to the right, aiming the twin 30 \n               calibre machineguns at the politicians. They move aside.\n\n                                     ENGINEER\n                         This simple control system means \n                         that even semi-skilled employees can \n                         operate the unit with a minimum of \n                         training. As they say, \"Even a child \n                         can operate it.\"\n\n               Standing with Chief Kates, Eddie watches the demonstration \n               with contempt. Kates turns to him.\n\n                                     KATES\n                         He's talking about you, Cusack. Pay \n                         attention. You're all gonna have to \n                         be qualified on this. It's the future.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Just what the world needs, another \n                         gun without a brain.\n\n                                     KATES\n                         You're looking at the perfect cop. \n                         The damn thing follows orders.\n\n               Eddie has seen enough.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         I got better things to do than play \n                         with toys.\n\n               Kates is about to say something when the demonstrator \n               interrupts.\n\n                                     ENGINEER\n                         If the Commander will pick someone \n                         to try and elude 'Prowler,' we can \n                         show how our various target \n                         acquisition systems function.\n\n               Kates points to Eddie, and smiles.\n\n               Instantly the turret sweeps the horizon and locks on Eddie \n               as he walks across the astro turf.\n\n               CLOSE-UP of the Prowler's hand controller.\n\n               The MONITOR SCREEN shows the crosshairs on the back of Eddie's \n               head. ON THE SCREEN the digital readout says: LOCKED AND \n               TRACKING.\n\n                                     MACHINE\n                              (from speaker)\n                         Bang. You're dead.\n\n               Eddie keeps walking, seemingly oblivious to the Prowler. \n               Suddenly he whirls and ducks behind a wall out of the \n               Prowler's sight.\n\n               He pops up with his gun pointed at the Prowler's controller.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Drop it.\n\n               The controller, scared shitless, drops the hand control.\n\n               The Prowler dies -- the plug pulled.\n\n               Eddie smiles at Kates, and exits.\n\n               INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY\n\n               The curtain is drawn back from the viewing window and the \n               Comachos SEE the bodies of their cousins. Luis is here with \n               Pompas, Efren, and Victor. Their attorney, Sanchez, has joined \n               them.

Uh, you gonna be using those \n                         Cubs' tickets?\n\n               Eddie reaches into his pocket, and tosses a ticket to \n               Flannigan who grins.\n\n               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie and Kosalas cruise the Rush Street area at night. They \n               search the neon lit crowds on the sidewalks for a glimpse of \n               Lou Gamiani.\n\n               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY\n\n               On a tree-shaded block of classic brownstones, the unmarked \n               car is parked at the corner.\n\n               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY\n\n               Eddie is at the wheel wearing a sportscoat and sweater, \n               scanning the sports page. Kosalas is nervous and chatty, \n               bubbling. He's still reading the records from the morgue.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         This Ganiani's a swinger, huh?\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         He's just makin' up for the time he \n                         spent in the joint.\n\n               EXT. GAMIANI'S STREET - DAY\n\n               LOU GAMIANI, 55, Italian, and huge, comes out the front door \n               of a brownstone, and gives a perfunctory kiss to his aging \n               \"Playmate\", who stands in the doorway in a housecoat. Gamiani \n               comes down the steps, and jumps into a car.\n\n               In the car with Gamiani, a fat man, TITO, is at the wheel. \n               They pull into the street passing the unmarked car.\n\n               EXT. NORTH SIDE STREET - DAY\n\n               Trailing Gamiani and his partner through the North Side \n               neighborhoods, they wind up in Lincoln Park.\n\n               With considerable skill Kosalas and Eddie manage to stick to \n               them undetected.\n\n               EXT. PARK - DAY\n\n               Gamiani and Tito park by the botanical gardens and stroll \n               past the fields of flowers into the zoo. Eddie and Kosalas \n               follow.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Now what? They selling protection to \n                         the bears?\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Relax kid.\n\n               EXT. CHILDREN'S ZOO - DAY\n\n               Strolling among the baby elephants and fuzzy rabbits, the \n               two heavies could not be more out of place. Tito has a racing \n               form. Lou, tall enough to see over heads, looks like a loose \n               gorilla on the prowl. He is searching for somebody.\n\n               Surrounding the incubators filled with hatching chicks is a \n               cluster of schoolchildren.\n\n               They are having a ball.\n\n               Eddie has noticed DIANA, a lovely 19 year old who is in charge \n               of the children.\n\n               And she has noticed Gamiani. She's visibly upset.\n\n                                     KOSALAS (V.O.)\n                         What's this? Kinda young for that \n                         old fart ain't she?\n\n                                     EDDIE (V.O.)\n                         Just watch, kid. Learn.\n\n               Diana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         Be back in a minute.\n\n               She crosses to the two goons and looks up at Gamiani.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         What do you want?\n\n                                     LOU\n                         Your Papa worries about you.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.\n\n               Gamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they \n               don't move.\n\n               INT. GORILLA HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies \n               into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an \n               iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch \n               at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, \n               kisses the thick glass that separates them.\n\n               Lulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, \n               staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. \n               Tito eats popcorn.\n\n               Eddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding \n               a balloon.\n\n               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Diana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye \n               to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to \n               their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building.\n\n               Gamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street.\n\n               Eddie comes around the corner, and follows her in.\n\n               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY\n\n               The sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special \n               Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers \n               briefly with another staff member.\n\n               INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY\n\n               Through the open door of the Special Education Program office, \n               Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers.\n\n               INT. READING ROOM - DAY\n\n               Eddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past \n               long tables and out the other door.\n\n               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Diana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of \n               homebound commuters, and catches a cab.\n\n               And head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of \n               heads, is Lou Gamiani.\n\n               Tito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the \n               curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab.\n\n               Eddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car.\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               Diana enters an apartment building.\n\n               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY\n\n               By the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, \n               and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a \n               cab.\n\n               EXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT\n\n               The taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. \n               Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked \n               door. The door opens and they disappears inside.\n\n               Gamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and \n               it's lights switch off.\n\n               Eddie's car pulls up. Eddie hops out. Kosalas slides behind \n               the wheel.\n\n               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie leans down to the open drivers window.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Hold here a second.\n\n               Eddie goes to the back of the car, and Kosalas follows him \n               in the rearview mirror, losing sight when Eddie pops open \n               the trunk.\n\n               Kosalas watches the party goers enter the building.\n\n               There is a tapping at the window.\n\n               Eddie has donned a baseball uniform, matching cap, and now \n               carries a baseball bat with a pair of cleats hanging from \n               it.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Keep with Gamiani.\n\n               Eddie tosses the keys back to Kosalas, and heads to the \n               building. Kosalas calls to him.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Bang a few for me.\n\n               INT. PARTY STAIRS - NIGHT\n\n               In the darkened stairway Eddie joins a group of outrageously \n               dressed characters. The door at the top of the stairs bursts \n               open on a punk-funk art student Halloween party.\n\n               INT. PARTY - NIGHT\n\n               A hundred people are jammed into the studio. It feels like \n               the Star Wars Saloon. The LIVE MUSICIANS match the look of \n               the party. The costumes are outrageous. Everyone is dancing.\n\n               Eddie looks the place over. He spots Diana.\n\n               Eddie walks over to her, grabbing a drink along the way. He \n               sidles up to Diana.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Wanna play ball?\n\n               She looks him over taking in the outfit, the bat.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         Are you pitching?\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Some people say I've got a pretty \n                         good inside curve.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         I don't know.

He sets his \n               drink down, and turns to find a girl, luscious as hell, \n               dressed like a Frederick's wet dream, making eyes at him. \n               She takes his bat, and gives it a long, lascivious lick.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         You'll get slivers.\n\n               He walks by her.\n\n               INT.

Eddie watches her leave, and then \n               steps over a few of the wasted witches to get to the phone \n               on the drug laden coffee table. He dials.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (to phone)\n                         This is Sergeant Cusack.

One \n               of the ladies tries to casually cover the cocaine with a \n               magazine.

GYM - DAY\n\n               The apartment is only a mockup set in the corner of this \n               vast skylit city warehouse. Runners race around the track at \n               the perimeter.\n\n               On the wall are large photos and diagrams of the Prowler. \n               Below the photos are sign-up sheets for the required training \n               sessions.\n\n               In another corner is the weight room, the ring, and the \n               workout area.

As Cragie \n               goes out, Donato comes in on crutches.

WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               A tan Dodge rolls over the rutted scrapyard roadway, bouncing \n               toward the immense old warehouse along the river's edge. The \n               city seems to have abandoned this remote industrial area; \n               giant grain elevators, rusting freighters and vast scrapyards \n               surround us.\n\n               INT.

Off, \n                         asshole.\n\n               Rocco goes for Eddie. A couple of quick blows and Rocco is \n               in the water. Eddie continues up the gangway to the rear of \n               the boat.\n\n               EXT. YACHT - DAY\n\n               Eddie finds FELIX (THE RAIL) SCALESE sitting on a chaise \n               lounge, reading.

It's a prediction.\n\n               On the shore, Kosalas is honking the car horn to get Eddie's \n               attention. Eddie rises.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         There's a shitstorm coming.

YACHT - DAY\n\n               Eddie walks by as Rocco, soaking wet, is pulling himself \n               from the water. Eddie pushes him into the water again.\n\n               Kosalas is still sounding the HORN.\n\n               EXT. HARBOR - DAY\n\n               Eddie runs toward the car.\n\n               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY\n\n               A body lies in the flowers in the service area next to the \n               giant greenhouse. Several unmarked cars and two blue and \n               whites are parked in the dirt drive as Eddie and Kosalas \n               pull up. The cops have roped off the area. Music and Brennan \n               are there.\n\n               Eddie looks at the body as Music comes over.\n\n                                     MUSIC\n                         Tony Luna's bagman.\n\n               Kosalas looks at the body.\n\n                                     MUSIC\n                         They call that a Columbian necktie.\n\n               Kosalas winces.\n\n                                     MUSIC\n                         They found the manager of Tony's \n                         restaurant hanging from a hook in \n                         his kitchen. Looked like someone \n                         tried to carve a canoe out of him. \n                         Tony's used car lot on Ashland is \n                         burning as we speak. The head salesman \n                         is a fried zuccini.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Oh Jesus.

LUNA'S STREET - DAY\n\n               A kid on a bike makes his way up the quiet tree-lined street, \n               tossing newspapers onto the porches of the block.\n\n               Around the corner at the end of the block, the produce truck \n               starts slowly forward. As it turns onto Luna's block, a car \n               pulls up behind it and stops, blocking the street.\n\n               The produce truck parks at the curb in front of the Luna \n               house. A neighbor from across the street approaches. The \n               front door of Luna's house opens, and Tito emerges, helping \n               Tony's aged mother down the steps to buy vegetables.\n\n               INT. PRODUCE TRUCK - DAY\n\n               On the floor near the wheelwell is the dead produce man.\n\n               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY\n\n               The rear doors of the produce truck swing open. The neighbor, \n               Tito, and Tony's mother are instantly killed.\n\n               From outside three Comachos enter the open front door of the \n               Luna house. We hear the SOUND of MUFFLED GUNFIRE from inside.\n\n               INT. LUNA'S HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Bits and pieces. A Shattered orange juice container. Eggs \n               cooking on the stove. A woman's vanity.\n\n               On the floor; a woman's legs, a housecoat, slippers. A \n               silhouette of a Comacho in the hallway RAKING one of Tony's \n               guards.\n\n               A family photo on the mantle which includes Diana and her \n               father is BLASTED to bits.\n\n               EXT. LUNA'S BACK YARD - DAY\n\n               One of Tony's men tries to escape through the back of the \n               house. He is pursued by a Comacho who guns him down.\n\n               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY\n\n               Luis Comacho sits in a car in the next block surveying the \n               scene. The cousins are walking briskly out. They jump in a \n               car and drive off.\n\n               INT. LUIS' CAR - DAY\n\n               Luis nods to his driver. They pull away.\n\n               EXT. LUNA'S STREET - DAY\n\n               The street is QUIET again. Next door, a neighbor, wearing \n               only his underpants and carrying an old pistol, stands \n               trembling in disbelief.\n\n               EXT. LAKE - DAY\n\n               Pines reflect in the dappled lake as Tony Luna rows slowly \n               for shore. He ties up at the dock. He's taking his tackle \n               out of the boat when one of his boys comes running down to \n               the dock.\n\n               We cannot hear the conversation but we can see Tony drop the \n               tackle box and we can hear his SCREAM echo across the water.\n\n               EXT. EDDIE'S STREET - DAY\n\n               Eddie runs down the rear stairs to Kosalas' unmarked car. He \n               opens the driver's door, pushes Kosalas across the seat, and \n               gets behind the wheel. He PEELS OUT.\n\n               INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                         Music's at the scene.\n\n               Eddie picks up the mike.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                              (to mike)\n                         Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish \n                         hair.\n\n                                     MUSIC (V.O.)\n                              (on radio)\n                         Two male caucasians, two female. One \n                         mid-to-late forties. The other a \n                         grandmother.\n\n               With the SIREN full out, LEANING ON the HORN, he simply puts \n               his foot on the floor and sends the car into a four wheel \n               drift that slides into a neat U-turn.\n\n               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Eddie leaves the car running, and burst through the main \n               entrance flashing his badge at the stunned security guards.\n\n               INT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Eddie races through the corridors and reading rooms searching, \n               Kosalas arriving at his heels.\n\n               INT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Gamiani tells Diana about her mother and grandmother.\n\n               INT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Three Comachos; Pompas, Efren, and ANGEL, search for Diana.\n\n               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Lou Gamiani emerges from the building with Diana. She is \n               terrified.\n\n               He checks out the scene, then descends the crowded steps and \n               crosses the street, keeping a sharp lookout.\n\n               EXT. FLOWER SHOP - DAY\n\n               Luis and Victor Comacho loiter by the outdoor flower stand \n               next to the library. They watch the activity on the library \n               steps.\n\n               EXT. LIBRARY - DAY\n\n               Distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, \n               Lou fails to notice the two Comachos who have fallen in step \n               behind them. He goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a \n               knife sticking from his back. A Comacho grabs Diana's arm. \n               She jabs him in the eyes, and runs.\n\n               Diana disappears into the crowd.\n\n               Hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. A woman stands \n               in horror unable to keep from looking at Gamiani's body lying \n               on the sidewalk. She SCREAMS.\n\n               Eddie and Kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the \n               museum.\n\n               The girl isn't here.\n\n               Eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the \n               el station.\n\n               He dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic \n               screeching to a halt.\n\n               Kosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, \n               then tears out after Eddie.\n\n               EXT. WABASH AVENUE - DAY\n\n               In the shadow of the el tracks, Diana runs for her life, \n               racing north on Wabash through crowds of shoppers with the \n               Comachos moving relentlessly a half block behind.\n\n               Opposite Marshall Field's, she abruptly cuts across traffic \n               and runs into an alley between the giant men's and women's \n               stores.\n\n               With terror in her eyes, Diana runs, searching frantically \n               for a guard, a policeman, somebody with a gun. But the \n               Comachos are closing in on her.\n\n               She dives through a revolving door into the building.\n\n               INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY\n\n               Diana runs past the perfume displays, notions, and lingerie, \n               and out the Randolph Street exit.\n\n               EXT. RANDOLPH STREET - DAY\n\n               Two Camachos, who stayed on the street, spot her as she \n               leaves.\n\n               Racing through the alley, Eddie spots them running in the \n               next block.\n\n               EXT. LAKE STREET - DAY\n\n               Running east on Lake Street, she glances over her shoulder. \n               She doesn't see them. She ducks into the alley. But the \n               Comachos round the corner just in time to catch a glimpse of \n               her.\n\n               EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\n               This alley leads to the lower level of Michigan Avenue. She \n               turns back to find the exit blocked by the Comachos. She \n               flees downward.\n\n               INT. LOWER MICHIGAN - DAY\n\n               The green flourescents of the \"Emerald City\" give a deathly \n               cast to the underground street as Diana rounds the corner, \n               and collapses against the wall. Her heart pounding like a \n               frightened deer, she has run as far as she can.\n\n               Pompas Comacho and two of his colleagues come racing around \n               the corner. They spot her crouched against the wall.\n\n               She starts to SCREAM but Angel grabs her by the collar and \n               pulls her up to his face and she stops, wide-eyed with terror \n               as he touches her throat with his knife.\n\n                                     POMPAS\n                         Come on, Chika. We gonna have some \n                         fun. You gonna take us to your father.\n\n               We hear a loud metallic CLICK. We see the barrel of a huge \n               revolver. They wheel to see Eddie crouched, gun drawn, in \n               the alley entrance.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Pompas, you're getting to be a fucking \n                         pain in the ass.\n\n               The boys put their hands up, but Eddie doesn't see the third, \n               SAMO, coming up behind him.\n\n               Angel grabs Diana by the hair, shielding himself, and starts \n               backing up the stairs that lead to the street.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Let her go, pooch.\n\n               Samo jumps Eddie, and the gun goes flying. It hits the \n               pavement and bounces off the high curb into the street.\n\n               In a staggering blur Eddie takes out the Comachos, kicking \n               the last one end over end. But Angel and the girl have \n               disappeared to the street above.\n\n               Eddie retrieves his gun and runs up the steps.\n\n               EXT. STATE LAKE EL STATION - DAY\n\n               With a knife at her side, Angel Comacho leads Diana up the \n               steps of the old el station. They pass through the turnstyle \n               out onto the platform just as the train pulls to in. Angel \n               forces her onto the train.\n\n               Eddie comes pounding up the steps and onto the platform just \n               in time to stop the closing train door with his foot.\n\n               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY\n\n               Eddie wedges his way aboard and the train pulls out. The \n               passengers looks at him like he's crazy.\n\n               Eddie works his way through the cars toward the rear.\n\n               Angel spots him. Knife still in hand, he pulls Diana from \n               car to car past the terrified passengers until finally he is \n               cornered at the end of the train. Angel searches frantically \n               for a way out.\n\n               Eddie enters. Diana sees him.\n\n                                     ANGEL\n                         Another step, and I take her head \n                         off.\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         You don't have the balls.\n\n               Eddie takes another step.\n\n               Diana slams her elbow into Angel's groin, and breaks free.\n\n               Angel jumps back. He breaks open the rear door and climbs \n               out.\n\n               EXT. EL TRAIN - DAY\n\n               Angel climbs up the back of the car onto the roof.\n\n               Eddie's right behind him.\n\n               The spectacular pursuit from car to car on the roof of the \n               speeding el train is witnessed by startled second-floor \n               secretaries whose desks look directly out at the roof of the \n               passing cars.\n\n               VERY HIGH ANGLE\n\n               Angel and Eddie's figures appear as specks, roaring through \n               the canyon of skyscrapers.\n\n               ON TRAIN ROOF\n\n               A low bridge forces both men to hug the roof of the train. \n               Eddie recovers first and grabs Angel, pulling him down. They \n               roll from side to side on the roof, nearly slipping over the \n               side. With a desperate shove, Angel breaks free. Eddie points \n               his gun at him. The train is now over the Chicago River. \n               Angel dives into the water.\n\n               Eddie reholsters his gun and dives in after him.\n\n               INT. EL TRAIN - DAY\n\n               We see Diana's looking out the window of the train. She \n               follows Eddie's decent with her eyes.\n\n               EXT. RIVER - DAY\n\n               Dozens of startled pedestrians line the bridge railing as \n               Eddie swims toward Angel, bobbing in the middle of the stream.\n\n               A hotdogger in a speedboat is racing up the river and Angel \n               is directly in his path. The skipper, showing off for his \n               passengers, doesn't notice him until he hears the sickening \n               THUNK under the keel. The boat's wake is suddenly red with \n               blood.\n\n               EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY\n\n               Eddie is helped from the water by a couple of passersby.\n\n               He stands there, soaking wet, looking around.\n\n               A crowd is gathering. We hear SIRENS in the background. Then \n               he spots her.\n\n               Diana is standing on the bridge watching him.\n\n               EXT. BRIDGE - DAY\n\n               Eddie walks to Diana, and she folds into his arms. He holds \n               her a second.\n\n               EXT. LAGOON - DAY\n\n               Eddie, now in dry clothes, and Diana walk along the lagoon.\n\n               They talk, argue, and she sits on a bench and cries. Eddie \n               comforts her.\n\n                                     DIANA\n                         Where are you taking me?\n\n                                     EDDIE\n                         Downtown first.

There are a half a dozen women there also. Three of \n               them are cops.\n\n               Kosalas is here too. He's been drinking. He leans against \n               the wall talking on the pay phone by the men's room.\n\n                                     KOSALAS\n                              (to phone)\n                         Say, Eddie.

There is a stillness at the \n               front door. One of the hoods from outside steps in. He wears \n               a leather coat.\n\n               The heads at the bar turn.\n\n               He walks the length of the bar and enters the john. He is \n               obviously out of place in this saloon. Nobody has both hands \n               on the bar.\n\n               The front door opens. The other hood steps in, walks up to \n               the bar, and orders.\n\n                                     SECOND HOOD\n                         Bartender.

Only the JUKEBOX makes a sound. The two \n               hoods, eyes fixed on the array of iron pointed at them, can't \n               even swallow. Finally...\n\n                                     SECOND HOOD\n                              (to partner)\n                         You stupid motherfucker.\n\n               The cops swarm the hoods and in an instant they are on the \n               floor being cuffed and roughly handled.

A couple of people get up and \n               head for the door.\n\n               Eddie gets to his feet and heads for the door.

POOL HALL - DAY\n\n               Eddie opens the door and emerges from the back room. A dozen \n               Comacho goons have gathered. Behind them are another two \n               dozen hostile spectators. But no sign of the backup.\n\n               He pulls out his gun. The remaining innocent bystanders split \n               for the exit. Eddie walks forward into the room. The Comachos \n               and their soldiers stand around him. Several have guns.\n\n               Eddie keeps them under the point of his gun. He gets to the \n               door and has to turn his back on it to keep the gang in his \n               sights.\n\n               A gun is pressed into Eddie's back. He drops his gun.\n\n               Luis kicks Eddie across the room.

The battle is on. Hardwood pool cues crack \n               around him.\n\n               The first four or five never get a chance to lay a finger on \n               him. Battered and broken, they litter the billiard tables \n               and floor. But Eddie is outnumbered 20 to 1.\n\n               INT.

Blind-sided, he goes \n               down and they are on him like jackals.\n\n               They drag him to the top of the rear stairs, and kick him \n               down to the alley.\n\n               It seems like they are about to finish him off when suddenly \n               all is quiet. The crowd parts. Eddie looks up through swollen \n               eyes to see Luis Comacho standing above him, cool as ice. \n               Luis reaches down and pulls Eddie's head up by the ear.\n\n                                     LUIS\n                         The sun comes up.

POOL HALL ALLEY - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie opens a bloody eye and looks over his surroundings. \n               He's alone. He moves, a joint at a time, checking himself \n               out.\n\n               Staggering to his feet, he opens a spiggot on the wall.

UPPER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               Roaring north on Wacker past an astonished group in front of \n               the Civic Opera House, the Cadillac drops out of sight on \n               the down-ramp to Lower Wacker.\n\n               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               This bi-level street is as different as night and day. The \n               lower level's eerie green lights make us feel like we're \n               under water.

EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie is gaining in the battered Chevy. The Cadillac rockets \n               up the next ramp to the street level.\n\n               EXT. UPPER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               The Cadillac zooms up from below, crosses the intersection, \n               and immediately takes the next down-ramp. Eddie flies up \n               from below, briefly airborne, barreling after them into the \n               tunnel.\n\n               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               A block later the Cadillac heads topside again. Eddie takes \n               a gamble and goes straight ahead.\n\n               At the next down-ramp, the Cadillac descends and Tony's boys \n               find themselves doing 70 knots side by side with Eddie in \n               the other lane.\n\n               In the narrow concrete tunnel, the two cars battle each other \n               like bulls in a chute, each one trying to cut the other off, \n               bouncing from each other into the walls and back again.\n\n               INT.

In the \n               struggle, the gun goes off and drills Rocco, the driver, \n               through the side of the head.\n\n               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               The Cadillac ROARS out of control, its dead driver's foot \n               pressing the accelerator to the floor. Scalese, in the front \n               seat, tries to grab the wheel.\n\n               Eddie is all over the road trying to avoid them. The river \n               and the curve are ahead.\n\n               Scalese's car hits the median at high speed, rolls, and slides \n               SCREAMING into a concrete pillar and EXPLODES.\n\n               Eddie stands on the brakes as his car slides alongside the \n               flaming wreckage.\n\n               INT. EDDIE'S CAR - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie's car is on fire now, and the doors have been rammed \n               shut. He kicks the window out on the passenger side.\n\n               EXT. LOWER WACKER - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie runs for his life. The explosion knocks him to his \n               knees.\n\n               He gets up and moves away, looking back at Luna's and \n               Scalese's spectacular funeral pyre.\n\n               EXT.

He walks past the streaming \n               hoses and slips into a parked blue and white, it's mars lights \n               still flashing. He roars off.\n\n               INT.

LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Eddie opens his locker and takes out his sawed-off automatic \n               shotgun. He checks the action. He loads it. He fills a duffle \n               bag with ammo and drops in another gun. He closes the locker \n               and heads out.\n\n               INT. GYM - NIGHT\n\n               The duty officer is still occupied. Eddie eases past him and \n               checks the key-board at the desk. He finds what he's looking \n               for.

DOCK - DAY\n\n               Against the grotesque shapes of the surrounding scrapyards, \n               Eddie moves quickly from one concealment to the next, crouched \n               low, advancing on the abandoned factory at the end of the \n               dock.\n\n               He lays down his duffle and pulls out a Halliburton case. He \n               opens it.\n\n               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n               From inside the garbage truck WE HEAR an ENGINE STARTING. It \n               REVS a couple of times. And from within the container \n               compartment of the truck emerges the Prowler. It clatters \n               down the ramp.\n\n               EXT. GRAIN ELEVATOR - DAY\n\n               The lookout spots the Prowler moving down the dock. He can't \n               believe his eyes.\n\n               He sights on the machine and FIRES.\n\n               And in the distance, the Prowler senses the insult and \n               immediately turns its camera eye up to him.\n\n               The lookout FIRES again. Immediately, the turret swivels and \n               the twin MACHINEGUNS ROAR.\n\n               It's a long way down.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               The SOUND of MACHINEGUN FIRE from outside galvanizes the \n               Comachos. Luis runs through the long building toward the \n               front with half a dozen of his men, all SHOUTING.\n\n               EXT. DOCK - DAY\n\n               Eddies eyes watch the miniature monitor of the Prowler's \n               hand controller. On the monitor WE CAN SEE the Comachos \n               running out in the front of the factory from the camera on \n               top of the Prowler.\n\n               Eddie gets up and moves toward the factory. He looks up at \n               several high broken windows.\n\n               EXT. DOCK - DAY\n\n               The Prowler is having a field day. It's electronic sensors \n               trace the source of every hostile shot and immediately return \n               a withering stream of hot lead that chews the surrounding \n               scenery -- and several Comachos -- to pieces.\n\n               But Eddie has not figured out how to control the Prowler's \n               BULLHORN VOICE command system. It continues to BARK ORDERS \n               to the dead hoodlums in three languages.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Luis runs through the empty plant toward the office screaming \n               to Diana's guards.\n\n                                     LUIS\n                              (subtitles)\n                         Now! Do it now! Kill her!\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Diana, tied to the chair, is momentarily alone as the guards \n               rush out to the floor of the factory to see what's happening.\n\n               The two guards, their guns flying from their hands, are \n               hammered back into the room by Eddie who blasts through the \n               door after them.\n\n               Diana is petrified.\n\n               INT. SQUAD CAR - DAY\n\n               Kosalas and Kates are in the same car. Kosalas is driving.\n\n                                     DISPATCHER (V.O.)\n                              (from radio)\n                         ...Harbor Patrol reports gunfire and \n                         explosions in the vicinity of Calumet \n                         Harbor...\n\n                                     KATES\n                         That's Cusack.\n\n               Kosalas spins the wheel into a U-turn.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               The \"Prowler\" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret \n               bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other \n               stupefied Comachos further back into the building.\n\n               Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller.\n\n               The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank \n               with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous \n               streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading \n               dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the \n               structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.\n\n               COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT\n\n               Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the \n               ground, shattered.\n\n               The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree \n               circle until all the ammo is gone.\n\n               Then SILENCE.\n\n               Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not \n               serious.\n\n               It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos \n               are still hidden in the factory.\n\n               Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still \n               bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and \n               broken.\n\n               But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel \n               plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand.\n\n               Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and \n               blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.\n\n               INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward \n               the light streaming through the factory entrance. He takes \n               off his jacket and wraps it around Diana's shoulders.\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               The pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every \n               second.\n\n               A fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the Prowler's \n               incendiary ammunition.\n\n               The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the \n               arriving \"Home Team.\"\n\n               Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car. \n               Brennan and Music are running down the dock. Donato, a cast \n               on his leg, hobbles after them.\n\n               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\n               Emergency vehicles are arriving, and more squad cars, paddy \n               wagons, and fire engines.\n\n               Eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance, now carrying \n               Diana. Kates calls out after him.\n\n                                     KATES\n                         Hey, Cusack!\n\n               Eddie stops, slowly turns around.\n\n               There is a long pause.\n\n                                     KATES\n                         I'm glad you don't follow orders.\n\n               Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in \n               the ambulance.\n\n               We pull back further and further until we see the rest of \n               the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away \n               with it's lights flashing.\n\n               Eddie walks down the pier alone.\n\n                                         THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of Silence\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Butler\u00a0\u00a0Dennis Shryack\u00a0\u00a0Mike Gray\u00a0\u00a0John Mason\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Drama\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:22:46.690104"}
