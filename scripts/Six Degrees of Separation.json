And terrified?\r\n          Has the apartment been violated?\r\n          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with\r\n          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is\r\n          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though\r\n          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern\r\n          paintings hang on the walls.\r\n          No. No visible disaster here.\r\n          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state?

SHE admires it.\r\n          FLAN opens the door from the hall into\r\n\r\n<b>          THE OFFICE.\r\n</b>          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets.

The boy can't\r\n           function. And at the end before he can run\r\n          away and start a new life, it starts to rain and\r\n          he folds.

Did you put that in your Times\r\n          piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out\r\n          on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was\r\n          an experience. I will not turn him into an\r\n          anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us\r\n          into life without turning it into an anecdote\r\n          with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over\r\n          and over for years to come. \"Tell the story\r\n          about the imposter who came into our lives---\"\r\n          \"That reminds me of the time this boy--\". And\r\n          we become these human juke boxes spilling out\r\n          these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How\r\n          do we keep the experience?\r\n          OUISA looks around the dinner table.\r\n          THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n<b>                         141\r\n</b>          FLAN (to his Dinner Partner)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          That's why I love paintings. Cezanne. The\r\n          problems he brought up are the problems painters\r\n          are still dealing with. Color. Structure.\r\n          Those are problems.\r\n          OUISA (to herself)\r\n          There is color in my life, but I'm not\r\n          aware of any structure.\r\n\r\n<b>                         FLAN\r\n</b>          What are you saying, darling?\r\n          OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back\r\n          to his dinner partner brightly.\r\n\r\n<b>                         FLAN\r\n</b>          Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his\r\n          canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush\r\n          stroke, give a reason for the color.\r\n\r\n<b>                         OUISA\r\n</b>          Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush\r\n          strokes.
