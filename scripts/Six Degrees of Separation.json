And terrified?\r\n          Has the apartment been violated?\r\n          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with\r\n          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is\r\n          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though\r\n          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern\r\n          paintings hang on the walls.\r\n          No. No visible disaster here.\r\n          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run\r\n          between the hall and the living room.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Is anything gone?\r\n          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing\r\n          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..\r\n\r\n                         FLAW\r\n          How can I look? I'm shaking.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          My god! The Kandinsky!\r\n          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the\r\n          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA Y\r\n          It's gone! Call the police!\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          There it is!\r\n          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a\r\n          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and\r\n          brilliantly colored.\r\n\r\n                         0UISA\r\n          Thank god!\r\n          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double\r\n          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in\r\n          different styles on either side of the canvas.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         2\r\n          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other\r\n          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.\r\n          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it\r\n          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the\r\n          geometric side. SHE admires it.\r\n          FLAN opens the door from the hall into\r\n\r\n          THE OFFICE.\r\n          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with\r\n          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide\r\n          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.\r\n          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          We could've been killed.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          Don't say that.

We could have been\r\n          murdered.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          I want to know if anything's gone?\r\n          HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver\r\n          beaver and looks at it with great objectivity..\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?\r\n          OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Slashed ---our throats slashed.\r\n          Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.\r\n          Would we have-woken up?\r\n          OUISA screams.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         3\r\n          But it's their pug dog licking her leg.\r\n          OUISA picks up the dog and pets it.\r\n          FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          We have to go to the wedding.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          I am in no mood to go to any wedding.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          We have to\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          They're your friends\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          I beg to differ.

The rain drumming outside and the distant\r\n          thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this\r\n          room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic,\r\n          even erotic.\r\n          A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and\r\n          leans against this white wall.

Not\r\n          Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The\r\n          Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left,\r\n          I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue\r\n          apartments.

This\r\n          is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on\r\n          either side.

One side is geometric and\r\n          somr=r.

The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors\r\n          then the dark colors.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          You like? You like? Chaos? Control?\r\n          Chaos? Control?\r\n          SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a\r\n          dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes.

He grew up\r\n          on Cat Island, \"so poor they didn't even own\r\n          dirt\" he has said. Neglected by his family, my\r\n          father would sit on the shore, and, as he told\r\n          me many times, \"conjure up the kind of worlds\r\n          that were on the other side and what I'd do in\r\n           them.\" He arrived in New York City from the\r\n           Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and\r\n           a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus\r\n           station across from the old Madison Square\r\n           Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved\r\n           to the roof of the Brill building, commonly\r\n           known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the\r\n           Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night.

And my father says ' I' m trying it out to\r\n          see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he\r\n          has no memory--only the scripts producers send\r\n          him in the mail through his agents.

A few weeks later, the teacher\r\n          returned to the classroom, shot the student\r\n          unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then\r\n          shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my\r\n          eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor\r\n          described the teacher as a nice boy. Always\r\n          reading Catcher In the Rye.\r\n          The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said\r\n          he did it because he wanted to-`draw the\r\n          attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and\r\n          the reading of that book would be his defense.\r\n          And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan\r\n          and his press secretary said if you want my\r\n          defense all you have to do is read catcher in\r\n          the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          I haven't read it in years.\r\n          OUISA shushes FLAN.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine\r\n          because I wanted to see what she had underlined\r\n          and I read this book to find out why this\r\n          touching, beautiful, sensitive story published\r\n          in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of\r\n          hate.\r\n          I started reading. : It's exactly as I\r\n          remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: \"My\r\n          brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute.\"\r\n          Page three: \"what a phony slob his father was.\"\r\n          Page nine: \"People never notice anything.\"\r\n          Then on page twenty two my hair stood up.\r\n          Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive\r\n          sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap.\r\n          \"A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of\r\n          closed one eye like I was taking aim at it.\r\n          This is a people shooting hat.

This book is preparing people for\r\n          bigger moments in their lives than I ever\r\n          dreamed of.\r\n          Then on p. 89 \"I'd rather push a guy out the\r\n           window or chop his head off with an ax than sock\r\n          him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what\r\n          scares me most is the other guy's face...\"\r\n          I finished the book. It's a touching story,\r\n          comic because the boy wants to do so much and\r\n          can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only\r\n          lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is\r\n          only hateful, and is completely self involved.\r\n          In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a\r\n          male adolescent.\r\n          FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed.\r\n           And what alarms me about that book--not the book\r\n           so much as the aura about it--is this: the book\r\n           is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't\r\n           function. And at the end before he can run\r\n          away and start a new life, it starts to rain and\r\n          he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing\r\n          about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It\r\n          may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett\r\n          be the great modern theme.\r\n          The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For\r\n          Godot--\"Let's go.\" \"Yes, let's go.\" Stage\r\n          directions: They do not move.\r\n          But the aura around this book of Salinger's--\r\n          which perhaps should be read by everyone ut\r\n          young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun\r\n          house mirror and amplifies like a distorted\r\n          speaker one of the great tragedies of our times-\r\n          --the death of the imagination.\r\n          Because what else is paralysis?\r\n          The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         42\r\n\r\n                         PAUL (CONTINUES)\r\n          The imagination has been so debased that\r\n          imagination--being imaginative-- rather than\r\n          being the lynch pin of our existence now stands\r\n          as a synonym for something outside ourselves\r\n          like Science fiction or some new use for\r\n          tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an\r\n          imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So\r\n          imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And\r\n          Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so\r\n\r\n                         IMAGINATIVE---\r\n          The imagination has moved out of the realm of\r\n          being our link, our most personal link, with our\r\n          inner lives and the world outside that world--\r\n          this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a\r\n          horrifying state where what's in here doesn't\r\n          match up with what's out there?\r\n          Why has imagination become a synonym for style?\r\n          I believe that the imagination is the passport\r\n          we create to take us into the real world.\r\n          I believe the imagination is another phrase for\r\n          what is most uniquely Is.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n          Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious.\r\n          Our boy Holden says \"what scares me most is the\r\n          other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you\r\n          could both be blindfolded\"--most of the time the\r\n          faces we face are not the other guys' but our\r\n          own faces. And it's the worst kind of\r\n          yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put\r\n          blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself.\r\n          To face ourselves.\r\n          That's the hard thing.\r\n          The imagination.\r\n          That's God's gift to make the act of self-\r\n          examination bearable.\r\n\r\n          PAUSE.\r\n          FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Well, indeed.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          I hope your muggers read every word.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         42\r\n          OUISA (chiding FLAN)\r\n\r\n                         DARLING\r\n\r\n                         GEOFFREY\r\n          I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at\r\n          the airport and read it.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Cover to cover\r\n\r\n                         PAUL\r\n          I'll test you.

OUISA undoes her dress.\r\n          THEY are in and out of bathroom and bedroom, -brushing\r\n          teeth.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          I want to get on my knees and thank god -money-\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Who said when artists dream they dream of money?\r\n          I must be such an artist.

We're safe.\r\n          OUISA in bed turns off the light.\r\n           FLAN looks out the window onto the park.\r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't\r\n          get this money,. Ouis, I would've lost the\r\n          Cezanne. It would've gone. I had nowhere to\r\n          get it.\r\n          OUISA gets out of bed and comes to FLAN.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Why don't you tell me how much these things\r\n          mean?

THE CAMERA comes in very close, circling\r\n          FLAN and OUISA, their love, their safety. Then THE CAMERA\r\n          drifts back and away from them, travelling out through the\r\n          window, out of their cocoon to\r\n\r\n          EXT THE APARTMENT BUILDING/CENTRAL PARK NIGHT\r\n          down the face of the solid apartment building and drifts\r\n          away through the night down into Central Park and stops at\r\n          the statue of the husky barking at the moon.\r\n\r\n          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          I dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to\r\n          acclaim. I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at\r\n          the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled\r\n          him? Sidney? What troubles you? Is it right\r\n          to make a movie of Cats?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM\r\n          FLAN is asleep on his side of the bed. OUISA is wide awake,\r\n          staring at A MAN in dinner clothes, who sits on the edge of\r\n          her bed. His back is to the camera. Is it SIDNEY POITIER?\r\n          THE CAMERA drifts in to OUISA, who is transfixed by this\r\n          apparition.\r\n          \"SIDNEY\" (very comforting)\r\n          I'll tell you why I have to make a movie of\r\n          Cats. I know what Cats is, Louisa. May I call\r\n          you Louisa?\r\n          (OUISA nods Yes)\r\n          I have no illusions about the merits of Cats.\r\n          But the world has been too heavy with all the\r\n          right to lifers. Protect the lives of the\r\n          unborn. Constitutional amendments. Marches!\r\n          When does life begin? Or the converse. The end\r\n          of life. The Right To Die. Why is life at this\r\n          point in the 20th century so focussed on the\r\n          very beginning of life and the very end of life?\r\n          What about the eighty years we have to live\r\n          between those two inexorable book ends?\r\n          THE CAMERA closes on OUISA. Her face, seen over \"SIDNEY's\"\r\n          shoulder, is all wonder.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         52\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          And you can get all that into Cats?\r\n          THE CAMERA drifts round with OUISA'S gaze to finally see\r\n          \"SIDNEY'S\" face. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,.\r\n          It is PAUL.\r\n\r\n                         PAUL/SIDNEY\r\n          I'm going to try.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Thank you. Thank you. You shall.\r\n          THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA. She is asleep.\r\n          CUT BACK to reveal\r\n          No one is sitting on the bed.\r\n          THE CAMERA moves onto FLAN's face, sleeping.\r\n          Slides of paintings by Matisse, Picasso, De Kooning, Pollock\r\n          appear over his face.\r\n\r\n                          FLAN (VO)\r\n           This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much\r\n           as realize this. I felt so close to the\r\n           paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces\r\n           of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in\r\n           the first place - what had got me into this -\r\n           and I thought - dreamed - remembered-\r\n\r\n           INT AIRPLANE HANGAR\r\n           FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide\r\n           carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air.\r\n\r\n                          FLAN (VO)\r\n           How easy it is for a painter to lose a\r\n           painting. He can paint and paint - work on a\r\n           canvas for months and one day he loses it - just\r\n           loses the structure - loses the sense of it -\r\n           you lose the painting.\r\n          A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see\r\n          A TEACHER, in her forties, very pure and happy, hanging\r\n          beautiful and brilliantly colored children's drawings in the\r\n          air. FLAN'S VOICE echoes in this vast space.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         53\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         FLAN\r\n          Why are all your students geniuses in the second\r\n          grade? Look at the first grade. Blotches of\r\n          green and black. Look at third grade.\r\n          Camouflage. But the second grade --your grade.\r\n          Matisses everyone. You've made my child a\r\n          Matisse. Let me study with you. Let me into\r\n          the second grade! What is your secret?\r\n\r\n                         THE TEACHER\r\n          Secret? I don't have any secret. I just know\r\n          when to take their drawings away from them.\r\n          THE TEACHER hangs pink shapes like paper versions of PAUL'S\r\n          button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of\r\n          the hangar.\r\n          THE SCREEN is filled with the color Pink.\r\n\r\n          EXT PINK SKY DAWN\r\n          The bright pink morning sky flashes with golden blotches,\r\n          abstract, until WE see it is the morning sun reflecting off\r\n          windows on the West Side of Central Park.\r\n          Then we realize it is the view from\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          THE KIZTREDGE'S MASTER BEDROOM DAWN\r\n          THE CAMERA pulls back from the window to FLAN and OUISA in\r\n          bed, cozy. SHE wakens, smiles, kisses HIM.\r\n          FLAN mumbles in his sleep and rolls over.\r\n          OUISA looks at her bedside clock. 6 A.M.\r\n          SHE gets out of bed, then pauses to take in the dawn\r\n          display.\r\n          OUISA walks through\r\n\r\n          THE LIVING ROOM\r\n          and opens the front door. SHE picks up the Sunday papers\r\n          and goes into\r\n\r\n          THE KITCHEN.\r\n          OUISA looks at the spotlessly clean sink and counter.\r\n          SHE flicks on the coffee machine and takes juice out of the\r\n          refrigerator scanning the front page.\r\n          SHE sits at the counter and opens the magazine to the back\r\n          page and begins to do the cross word puzzle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         54\r\n\r\n          MILLBROOK CLUB BAR\r\n          THE CHUMS hang on OUISA's every word.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross\r\n          word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I\r\n          never. met one person who didn't say they did it\r\n          in ink.\r\n\r\n          BACK IN THE KITCHEN\r\n          OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle. is it in ink? Then\r\n          looks up.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA (VO)\r\n          And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and\r\n          it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his\r\n          father and I didn't want him to be late and was\r\n          he healthy after his stabbing?\r\n          OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into\r\n\r\n          THE HALL.\r\n\r\n                         0\r\n\r\n                         OUISA (VO)\r\n          The hall is eighteen feet long.\r\n          OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA (VO)\r\n          I stopped in front of the door.\r\n          OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room.\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Paul?\r\n          SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning?\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Paul??\r\n\r\n                         PAUL (MOANING)\r\n\r\n                         YES YES\r\n\r\n                         OUISA\r\n          Are you all right?\r\n          OUISA opens the door to\r\n\r\n          HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         55\r\n           SHE turns on the light.

And\r\n          we become these human juke boxes spilling out\r\n          these anecdotes. But it was an experience.
