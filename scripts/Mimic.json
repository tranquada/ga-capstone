A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT\n     reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter\n     restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the\n     UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,\n     walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of\n     them.\n\n     PULL BACK TO REVEAL\n\n     INT. SEWER SYSTEM\n\n     Innards of steel. A vast maze of tunnels.\n\n     A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld\n     UV lamps.\n\n     The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,\n     their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT\n     VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-\n     CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.\n\n     The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.\n\n     NIGHT-VISION POV\n\n     Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some\n     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.\n\n     THE TEAM OF FIGURES\n\n     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a\n     flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.\n\n     She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty\n     small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach\n     with a different BARCODE on their back.\n\n     JUDAS ROACHES.\n\n     She kneels and opens the\n\n     CASE\n\n     TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide\n     through into the area.\n\n     THE NEARBY ROACHES\n\n     react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin\n     to stream toward the Judases.\n\n     Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.\n\n     They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach\n     the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them\n     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.\n\n     LATER\n\n     A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and\n     attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.\n\n     REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms\n     of the roaches, now all DEAD.\n\n     The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other\n     disposal drums.\n\n     At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:\n     the bar-coded Judas Roaches.\n\n     In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted\n     by the chains through the manhole to\n\n     EXT. A CITY STREET - DAY\n\n     MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.  A cacophony of SOUND and LIGHT.\n\n     Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink\n     everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped\n     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send\n     the cars on crosstown detours.\n\n     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near\n     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked\n     in a military phalanx.\n\n     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the\n     middle of the street, \"sealing\" the area with amber plastic.\n\n     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches\n     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.\n\n     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is\n     off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.\n\n     An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder.\n\n                          PETER (OS)\n                How we doing?\n\n     She looks over at DR. PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A\n     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the\n     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's\n     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                We'll see...\n\n     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,\n     shakes her head.  She wearily leans against him.\n\n     Peter looks out as the dumpster filled with roaches is raised\n     by MECHANICAL ARMS into the waiting maw of the dump truck.\n\n     THE SCREEN. DARKNESS.\n\n     A voice, a somber bas-relief in the darkness.\n\n                          ANCHORMAN (VO)\n                Strickler's Disease crept into Manhattan\n                like a thief in the night, claiming its\n                first hundred victims before it was even\n                classified.\n\n     INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLOATING SHOT\n\n     We FLOAT through a long hospital ward.\n\n     Past ROWS of illuminated oxygen tents, pulsating softly in\n     the dark like cocoons of light.\n\n                          ANCHORMAN (VO)\n                Most were children under ten.\n\n     TRACK past tents.  BODIES OF SMALL CHILDREN inside, wrapped\n     in white sheets, hooked up to IVs or breathing apparatus.\n     Skeletal hands, parched lips, glazed eyes.\n\n     BELLOWS of respirators push in and out, labored, failing.\n\n     IMAGE RESOLVES TO A VIDEO ON A SCREEN.\n\n     PULL BACK to reveal a number of SCREENS, each with a\n     different set of images.  We are in a NEWS VAN.   A\n     TECHNICIAN and DIRECTOR sit watching.\n\n     The voice belongs to an ANCHORMAN who's now overimposed.\n\n                          ANCHORMAN\n                Only after the numbers had reached into\n                the thousands were officials able to\n                identify the carrier of the deadly\n                infection...\n\n                          DIRECTOR\n                Cut to three.\n\n     The Technician manipulates the controls.  On another screen\n     we see them cut to STOCK NEWS FOOTAGE: regular cockroaches,\n     crawling on garbage.\n\n                          ANCHORMAN\n                Blattida Germanica.

OUTSIDE VAN - CITY HALL - DUSK\n\n     The runner exits the News Van.  Other such vehicles parked\n     nearby.  A CROWD of ONLOOKERS, REPORTERS and a gaggle of\n     PROTESTERS with handpainted signs.\n\n     Gliding past them, we pick up sound bites...\n\n                          REPORTER 1\n                ...an insect that has proven virtually\n                immune to chemical control...\n\n                          REPORTER 2\n                ...the announcement by the Health\n                Department that an end to the nightmare\n                has finally...\n\n     REPORTER 3 is interviewing a Greenpeace PROTESTER who is\n     holding up a photograph of Susan.\n\n                          REPORTER 3\n                ...an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan\n                Wyeth...\n\n                          PROTESTER\n                ...Susan has always been opposed to\n                biological tampering.

AUDITORIUM - CITY HALL\n\n     A NEWS CONFERENCE in progress.  A packed house.  T.V.\n     monitors spaced ever 10 seats or so. In the audience, the\n     MAYOR OF NEW YORK and various CITY OFFICIALS, listening to\n\n     Peter, speaking at the podium with the ease and enthusiasm of\n     a public servant still untainted by bureaucracy.\n\n     ON A TV MONITOR\n\n     While Peter talks, a news title appears at the bottom of the\n     screen: PETER TYLER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.\n\n                          PETER\n                     (wrapping up)\n                ...in Nature, evolution is a long,\n                leisurely conversation between an\n                organism and its environment. We,\n                however, did not have the luxury of\n                time...\n\n     Susan is waiting in the wings. She observes the audience.\n\n     She notices that the entire front row is composed of CHILDREN\n     who have survived Strickler's.  Leg and arm braces, facial\n     scarring...\n\n     He nods at Susan, who takes the podium, adjusting her jacket,\n     slightly ill at ease in her business suit.  She clears her\n     throat, speaks softly.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                With the aid of genetic labs throughout\n                the country, we recombined cockroach DNA\n                with genetic information from termites\n                and mantids. We were able to create a\n                biological counter-agent.  A new ally, if\n                you will...\n\n     She places a clear container on the podium for all to see.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Blattida Traditor.\n\n     CU CONTAINER\n\n     One of the Judas roaches skitters about in the container.\n\n                          SUSAN (OS)\n                The \"Judas Roach\".\n\n     Cameras FLASH.

She stumbles for a\n     second, then resumes her speech.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                The female is basically a sexual magnet;\n                common males travelled miles and fought\n                for the right to mate with them.\n\n     The audience is rapt.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                When they did, they took away something\n                else we added -- a hormone, passed\n                through sexual congress that causes their\n                metabolism to go into overdrive.  No\n                matter what their food intake, they\n                starved to death in a matter of hours.\n\n     Now Peter takes the mic.\n\n                          PETER\n                We've achieved almost total eradication\n                of the roach population.

TYLER APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SUSAN\n\n     in a tub in a dark bathroom. Her business suit crumpled\n     on the bathroom floor.  SOUND of a TV outside.\n\n                          PETER (OS)\n                Sus, come on.  You're missing it.\n\n     INT. LIVING ROOM\n\n     Nothing grand.  Peter in his shorts at a TV with shitty\n     reception.  He adjusts the disgruntled cable box.\n\n     He is seen over the TV, giving his address.\n\n                          PETER\n                Fucking thing!

I got most of the lines out.\n                     (No response.)\n                Sus?\n\n     Peter sighs. He picks up an open bottle of champagne and\n     two mis-matched ceramic cups, then heads for the bathroom.\n\n     INT. BATHROOM\n\n                          PETER\n                Life's a bitch. Our 15 minutes came\n                and went and all we got was bad\n                cable...\n\n     Susan doesn't answer, clearly not in the same high spirits.\n\n                          PETER\n                Hiding from the hard glare of publicity?\n\n     He notices her crumpled garment on the floor.  He picks it\n     up, puts it up on the hanger.\n\n                          PETER\n                A shame.  You looked great tonight.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Please.\n\n                          PETER\n                You did!\n\n     He sits by the tub.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Do you think we did the right thing?\n\n                          PETER\n                Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?\n\n                          SUSAN\n                You know what I mean...\n\n     Peter pours some champagne into the cups.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                We did no impact evaluation.

She doesn't take it.\n\n                          PETER\n                We know we saved lives.\n\n     He sits closer to her.\n\n                          PETER\n                There're gonna be a lot of kids running\n                around next year because of you.\n\n     Beat.  Susan starts to relax. He kisses her.\n\n                          PETER\n                Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple\n                of 'em'll be ours.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (smiling now)\n                We're down to a \"couple\" now, huh?\n\n     She pats the water, beckoning.\n\n                          PETER\n                Oh, I don't know. People are beginning\n                to talk about us...\n\n     Still partially clothed, he steps into the bathtub. Susan\n     shakes her head, laughs ruefully.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Don't worry, I'll save your honor.\n                Maybe I'll even marry you.\n\n     She reaches over, kisses him.\n\n                                                          FADE OUT:\n\n                                                        FADE IN TO:\n\n     EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT\n\n     The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.\n\n     ALPHABET CITY STREETS\n\n     Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking\n     on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy\n     layer of rain.\n\n     SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER\n\n     A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made\n     of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.\n\n     CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.\n\n     WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,\n     thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild\n     with terror.\n\n     He looks back down the steps.\n\n     Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex\n     shadows on the wall.\n\n     Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.\n\n     The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.\n\n     Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door\n     shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...\n     something inhuman, determined to break through.\n\n     The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.\n\n     On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to\n     grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.\n\n     He searches wildly for a possible escape.\n\n     He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the\n     sidewalk.\n\n     Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the\n     surrounding concrete.\n\n     WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something\n     SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.\n\n     The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the\n     adjoining building...\n\n     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV\n\n     Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a\n     suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a\n     tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is\n     being painted over.\n\n     THE CHINESE PREACHER\n\n     Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.\n     LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge\n     gives.\n\n     He CRIES OUT in terror.\n\n     The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make\n     it?\n\n     He takes a few steps back, a few more...\n\n     Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood\n     and rain.\n\n     THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.\n\n     Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things\n     onto the curtain of rain.\n\n     Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself\n     to the catwalk.\n\n     It's too far.\n\n     He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards\n     loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He\n     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a\n     loose board to save himself from falling.\n\n     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the\n     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.\n\n     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push\n     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.\n\n     BELOW\n\n     Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.\n\n     CU HANDS\n\n     The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.\n\n     FEET\n\n     The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to\n     find a purchase on the wet brick wall-\n\n     THE CHINESE PREACHER\n\n     is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'\n     model.  He looks up above him, sees something-\n\n                          CHINESE PREACHER\n                No.  Please, God, no!\n\n     A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.\n     Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely\n     on one end.\n\n     HANDS\n\n     The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the\n     wet wood.\n\n     His hands paw the air.\n\n     WIDER\n\n     For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems\n     suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.\n\n     THE GROUND\n\n     Impact. His body cracks the pavement.\n\n     Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.\n\n     We CRANE to reveal\n\n     A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET\n\n     CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the\n     Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.\n\n     He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.\n\n     APARTMENT\n\n     It's a small one-bedroom apartment.\n\n     An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.\n     MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,\n     benign face.\n\n     All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the\n     table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.\n\n     A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,\n     standing by the window is\n\n     CHUY\n\n     HIS P.O.V.\n\n     We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed\n     figure in a swirl of color.\n\n     Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.\n\n     CHUY\n\n                          CHUY\n                     (a whisper)\n                Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...\n\n     He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the\n     wire into shape.\n\n     THE PUDDLE OF PAINT\n\n     around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,\n     and across the neon sign...\n\n     CHUY\n\n     hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.\n\n     His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to\n     change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in\n     his eyes.\n\n     ACROSS THE ROOFTOP\n\n     We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's\n     attention.\n\n     TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...\n\n     The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins\n     moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps\n     forward and drops out of frame.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow\n     arc.\n\n     Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get\n     a better view.\n\n     GROUND LEVEL\n\n     The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the\n     rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other\n     noise FADES AWAY.\n\n     Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.\n\n     He begins to click them together.\n\n     Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.\n\n     THE CHINESE PREACHER\n\n     is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only\n     problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through\n     this hole.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     watches, still clicking with his spoons.\n\n     THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY\n\n     is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the\n     thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing\n     against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.\n\n     There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY\n     VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body\n     like a rag doll.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear\n     terrible cracking and scraping sounds.\n\n     THE WINDOW\n\n     The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the\n     hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of\n     the opening.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     watches, still fascinated.\n\n                          CHUY\n                     (very low)\n                Funny, funny shoes...\n\n     He starts a new wire sculpture.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXT. JOGGING PATH - CENTRAL PARK - DAWN\n\n     Peter is covered in sweat, running at a good clip around the\n     Central Park reservoir. A beautiful day dawns behind him; the\n     windows of the Beresford sparkle in the morning sun.\n\n     Peter outperforms most of the other RUNNERS in the track, his\n     steady rhythm evidence of years of practice. Keeping his\n     stride, he runs off the track and past a flock of OLD NUNS.\n\n                          PETER\n                Excuse me, ladies...\n\n     Without slowing down, Peter retakes the path and moves past\n     them.\n\n     EXT. JOGGER'S PATH - NEAR FIFTH AVENUE - LATER\n\n     Peter finally slows down. He checks his pulse and stops at a\n     water fountain.\n\n     As he drinks, he sees a DERELICT drawing a figure on the\n     sidewalk.\n\n     The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.\n\n     Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points\n     to a manhole cover set among the bushes.\n\n     Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.\n\n     Then the painted motif finally reveals itself.\n\n     GRAFFITI\n\n     A talismanic figure of raw, archetypal power. A few jagged\n     lines form the shape of a MAN IN AN OVERCOAT. His face is\n     little more than a malignant blotch.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT. MUSEUM - EXHIBIT ROOM - DAY\n\n     A room of half-finished exhibits. A group of SCULPTORS --\n     most of them undergraduates -- work on a gigantic piece\n     representing a termite mound.  They're supervised by SIRI, a\n     punkish young Indian research assistant.\n\n     Susan talks to some of the sculptors about a 100-1 scale\n     clay model of an insect's head.  She gestures to the\n     model's mandible set.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                ...no, guys, these have to fit\n                perfectly.  No spaces in between. Let\n                me tell you why. Insects have no\n                hands. All they have is this set of\n                mandibles.\n\n     She grabs the outer mandible set.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                See?  This little piggy will grab the\n                prey.\n\n     Then unfolds a second set...\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Then this little piggy will tear it\n                in half...\n\n     And a third!!!\n\n                          SUSAN\n                ...and this little one will grind it\n                to a pulp and push it in... all the\n                way into the mouth.

Then get it right.\n\n     A piece of the termite mound is raised above their heads,\n     revealing...\n\n     ...Peter, at the entrance, still dressed in his jogging\n     sweats. He smiles at Susan.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     EXHIBITS\n\n     Peter and Susan walk through.  Peter pulls something from a\n     KNAPSACK.

Susan proceeds behind an exhibit representing a\n     honeycomb.  Peter follows as she begins to arrange some tools.\n\n                          PETER\n                You know where they get this\n                fertility stuff?  They extract it\n                from the urine of menopausal Italian\n                nuns.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (laughs)\n                Monks bottle their own wine.

Susan grabs a\n     larvae model from a pile on the floor.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                You were the one who ran around with\n                ice in his underwear, don't forget\n                that.\n\n                          PETER\n                Don't get kinky here...\n\n     Peter takes the call. Susan cuts away the excess plastic on\n     the lid around the honeycomb moldings. The larvae fits\n     perfectly inside.\n\n                          PETER\n                Okay, meet me out front.\n                     (to Susan)\n                I gotta go.

It was either this\n                or the weather channel.\n\n     Peter walks over, kisses her.  He notices an open book of\n     INSECT MORPHOLOGY on her lap. There's a FULL COLOR\n     PHOTOGRAPH of an OOTHECA -- an insect eggcase.\n\n     INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER\n\n     Peter folds laundry into his/her piles.

It's more than\n                that.\n\n     Peter takes a bedsheet. Susan helps him fold it.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                You know why insects don't grow larger?\n                Because they don't have a complex\n                respiratory system. What I saw did. It\n                had lungs.\n\n     Peter walks backward with his end of the sheet.  The two\n     begin to fold it together.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Evolution doesn't work that fast.\n                Something pushed that thing to take the\n                leap.

It stops\n     before a traffic light.\n\n     A LEERING HOMELESS GUY with a greasy rag and greasier\n     cleaning solution approaches the windshield.\n\n                          ARMENIAN\n                No... Oh, shit. Get away, you Turk!\n\n     The Homeless guy begins wiping/smudging the windshield\n     with his dirty rag. The driver sends him away.\n\n     The light turns green.  The Driver accelerates, turning\n     on the windshield wipers to expunge the smears left by\n     the guy.\n\n     Susan sees something.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Pull over!\n\n                          ARMENIAN DRIVER\n                What...?\n\n     Susan motions excitedly.  The Driver pulls over. Susan\n     gets out.\n\n     EXT. OUTSIDE CAR\n\n     Susan rushes over, removes something from the windshield\n     wiper.\n\n     A BUTTERFLY, its wing pinned under the rubber flapper.\n     She holds it in her palm, then looks up at Peter.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Metaxonycha Godmani.\n\n                          PETER\n                So?\n\n     Susan looks around.  Just ahead is an empty LOT surrounded by\n     a wooden fence plastered with flyers for rock bands and\n     performance artists.\n\n     An identical BUTTERFLY perches on the edge of a board.\n\n     EXT. EMPTY LOT\n\n     Susan and Peter walk through waist-high GRASS of a small\n     urban wilderness.  Dozens of BUTTERFLIES flutter around them\n     from the weeds.\n\n                          RICKY (OS)\n                If you want your money back, forget it!\n\n     Peter and Susan look up.  The voice comes from a RAMSHACKLE\n     CLUBHOUSE, built of wood scraps and cardboard.\n\n                          DAVIS (OS)\n                We already spent it!\n\n     Susan walks forward.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                We're here to deal.\n\n     Long beat.

SUBWAY STATION - DAY\n\n     A BLUR of subway cars goes by with an ear-pulverizing SOUND.\n\n     At the end of the platform, Davis untwists a wire around the\n     busted lock of a locker room door. Peter paces nervously\n     nearby.\n\n                          PETER\n                Here, let me...\n\n     He starts on it himself. Meanwhile, Ricky stares at a\n     PHOTOGRAPH Susan has given to him:  a ribbed, tortoise-\n     brown colored EGGCASE.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                You sure you didn't see one of these?\n\n                          RICKY\n                Gross. What is it?\n\n                          SUSAN\n                An \"Ootheca\". An eggcase. It probably had\n                more, uh \"weirdbugs\" inside.\n\n                          RICKY\n                     (shakes his head)\n                No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.\n\n     Davis opens the door with a CLICK.\n\n     INT. SUBWAY LOCKER ROOM\n\n     A dark, abandoned LOCKER ROOM once used for transit workers.\n\n     Susan and Peter walk in with the boys, nervous in the off-\n     limits area.\n\n                          DAVIS\n                It was in that corner over there.\n\n     Davis points to a bank of dented metal LOCKERS.\n\n                          RICKY\n                Sucker was fast, man.\n                     (Picks up a pipe.)\n                Had to take it out with one a these.\n\n                          PETER\n                Okay, guys.  We'll take it from here.\n\n     Peter hands Ricky some money. The boy looksdown at it\n     slyly.\n\n                          RICKY\n                Make it ten an' we won't tell the cops\n                you're here.\n\n     Peter regards the little scam artist dryly.\n\n                          PETER\n                Let's keep it at five and I won't\n                condemn your clubhouse.\n\n     Peter hands him a couple of dollars more. The two boys\n     take off.\n\n     Peter removes a PENLIGHT from his pocket.\n\n     Dust covers everything. A forest of COPPER TUBING and PIPES\n     where the sinks used to be.\n\n     PETER\n\n     inspects the floor. It's littered with cheap objects:\n     chipped combs, used rubbers, soggy newspapers, smeared\n     heroin syringes.\n\n     Something shiny catches his eye. He picks it up.\n\n                          PETER\n                     (quietly)\n                Look, a broken tooth...\n\n     Something rustles nearby.\n\n     He notices an old, rotting poster on the back wall.  It\n     seems ODDLY TEXTURED somehow.  He walks toward it.\n\n     SUSAN\n\n     kneeling, pushes aside a dented trash bin. Behind it, there\n     is a cabinet with rusty sliding doors.\n\n     A SUBWAY TRAIN RUMBLES by outside, the sound echoes off\n     the tile walls.\n\n     Susan forces the door back. She peeks through the opening.\n\n     Her face stares back at her from a dirty pocket mirror.\n     She starts pulling something out.\n\n     PETER\n\n     at the oddly texture wall.  He shines the penlight at it...\n\n     ...and is met with a FLUTTER OF WINGS.  MOTHS, perfectly\n     camouflaged against the poster on the wall, whiz past him.\n\n     Peter recoils.\n\n                          SUSAN (OS)\n                You okay?\n\n     He nods.\n\n     SUSAN\n\n     turns back to her locker.  She withdraws a cheap PLASTIC\n     NECKLACE from it.  As she removes it, it breaks.  A coulpe of\n     beads fall away...\n\n     ...rolls under the locker...\n\n     ...and BOUNCE -- once, twice, thrice -- each time going\n     deeper till they comes to a stop.\n\n     Susan peers where the beads fell.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                There's something under here.\n\n     Peter comes over, kneels by her. Susan takes a handful of\n     beads and throws them at the base of the locker.\n\n     CAMERA TRACKS to follow one of them. It rolls all the way\n     under.\n\n     A moment later, from some interior space, the sound of it\n     BOUNCING on cement. He shines his light inside.\n\n     INT.

Unseen by Susan.  Terrifying in its doll-\n     like simplicity.  In the darkness, its features seem\n     indiscernable, inert, almost frozen in a perfectly\n     symmetrical pattern.\n\n     It regards the spiderlike movement of Susan's fingers.\n\n     SUSAN'S\n\n     face squinches with the effort.\n\n                          PETER\n                Honey, just leave it.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                No, there's...\n\n     INT.

Gucci flat pumps, all right.\n     Susan smiles.\n\n     Just then, a SUBWAY TRAIN pulls up.  The doors open,\n     disgorging passengers. Chuy flips into action.  He starts\n     playing his spoons, CLICKING them together, slapping them\n     against his knee.\n\n     Susan watches in wonder as the boy begins to use the spoons\n     to IMITATE the different rhythmical step patterns of the\n     VARIOUS COMMUTERS: The rolling, comical gait of A FAT MAN,\n     the lithe haughty step of A PRIM LADY.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (Laughs.

Hulking\n     out-of-service SUBWAY CARS surround him. He shines his light\n     on the ootheca picture and then around him at the walls.\n\n     A SOUND catches his attention.  A RUSTLING.\n\n     He notices something off to a corner, walks over to it.\n\n     A SHINY BROWN LUMP in the corner, covered in garbage.\n\n     He touches the lump with his shoe.

We see that\n     it was just a SHINY BROWN TARP.\n\n     Underneath, a group of THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE -- emaciated,\n     toothless -- sleeping intertwined for warmth. In the dim\n     light, they almost seem like a single organism.\n\n                          ERNEST\n                Guys, c'mon.\n\n     The Homeless People stare back at him mutely.

The RUMBLE grows LOUDER, LOUDER.\n\n     A SUBWAY TRAIN curves around the bend up ahead, its\n     HEADLIGHTS raking the opposite wall to reveal...\n\n     A FIGURE crouched over something.\n\n     We hear CHOMPING and SWALLOWING sounds.\n\n     CU ERNEST\n\n     Squinting to see over his flashlight beam.\n\n                          ERNEST\n                Hey, buddy!\n\n     No answer.

It's the OVERCOAT MAN.\n\n     Another distant RUMBLE. Ernest's clothes flutter in the puff\n     of hot wind that signals an approaching train.\n\n     Ernest pulls a CAN OF MACE from his belt, begins to advance.\n\n     The Overcoat Man stands up.\n\n     Ernest stops in his tracks.\n\n     For he sees that the Overcoat Man is holding a large OBJECT\n     in his arms. Something wet and shiny with blood.\n\n     A dead dog.\n\n     The Overcoat Man drops the animal.  It rolls slowly down his\n     chest...\n\n     ...and is briefly caught BY ANOTHER SET OF ARMS EXTENDING\n     FROM HIS TORSO.\n\n                          ERNEST\n                Sweet Jesus...\n\n     The Overcoat Man lets the animal fall to the ground.  He\n     begins walking toward Ernest.\n\n     Ernest backs away.\n\n     The Overcoat Man LEAPS on him just as the SUBWAY TRAIN ROARS\n     PAST!\n\n     CRACK! Ernest's body is twisted and crunched by powerful\n     arms.\n\n     Through the strobing windows we see Ernest enveloped by the\n     dark figure, then raised above, taken away.\n\n     TRACK\n\n     The can of mace rolls next to the track as the TRAIN CLEARS.\n\n     The track is empty again.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

He scans the\n     room, sees Siri leaning against a wall by the buffet\n     table, drinking an orange juice.

He yanks\n     harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging\n     precariously from a loose bolt.\n\n     It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.\n\n     He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the\n     tunnel behind him-\n\n     JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL\n\n     A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the\n     floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.\n     Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the\n     water and the light of a flare.  It stops-\n\n     JOSH\n\n     Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his\n     eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a\n     narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT\n     coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through\n     the opening-\n\n     MIMIC\n\n     The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if\n     mesmerized by its flow-\n\n     PIT - JOSH\n\n     With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.\n\n     He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered\n     around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the\n     sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He\n     looks up-\n\n     Above him is a grate.  He's come to the SHOWER ROOM of the\n     sweatshop!\n\n     INT. SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM\n\n     Empty now, except for the rusting sewing machines in a\n     corner.  We TILT to see Josh moving the grate away.  He\n     jumps- no way he can grab onto the slippery tile-\n\n     HIS HANDS SLIDE!!\n\n     PIT\n\n     Josh puts the old sewing machine upright.\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     Suddenly, the bolt hinging the plate gives way and... the\n     steel plate hits the ground: KLANGG!!\n\n     THE MIMIC\n\n     leaps into action!\n\n     PIT - JOSH\n\n     hears the CLICKING, fairly close.  He shines his light back\n     down the hole he entered through-\n\n     JOSH'S POV - THE MIMIC\n\n     moves past the waterfall and takes the wall at full speed.\n\n     JOSH\n\n                          JOSH\n                Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!\n\n     He stands on top of the sewing machine, wobbling, reaches for\n     the floor above-\n\n     SWEATSHOP SHOWER ROOM\n\n     Josh's head and one shoulder are in through the hole.  His\n     arms tremble. He makes a desperate lunge and manages to grab\n     the POWER CORD of one of the abandoned sewing machines.\n\n     THE MIMIC\n\n     rushes through the opening without even slowing down.\n\n     JOSH\n\n     pulls himself up, up-  WHAM!  The Mimic hits the lower part\n     of his body, BLOOD spraying up through the hole.  He SCREAMS,\n     grasps the cord with both hands!\n\n     He is brutally YANKED down into the hole, the sewing machine\n     tipping, then dragged across the tiled floor till it wedges\n     violently in the hole!\n\n     We track over to reveal, one of Chuy's perfectly\n     executed WIRE SCULPTURES. Sitting atop another sewing\n     machine.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     INT. REMAINS OF THE SUBWAY STATION\n\n     A ring of FLARES burns in the darkness like an island.  Peter\n     lights another one, revealing a space buried in layers of\n     dust and time.\n\n     Cracked MANNEQUIN FACES stares out from an unopened TAILOR\n     SHOP.  A FLOWER PARLOR decorated with cobwebs.  A yellowed\n     NEWSPAPER on the floor, its headlines reading:  GERMAN TROOPS\n     DRIVEN BACK ACROSS RHINE.\n\n     Peter looks up to see Leonard approaching from the track.\n\n                          PETER\n                Any luck?\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Well...there's an old service elevator\n                half a mile down the tracks.

Leonard unbuttons his holster clip,\n     places his hand on his .22\n\n     A SHADOW appears outside the archway.\n\n     It steps onto the platform.\n\n     Leonard frowns.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                     (tentative)\n                Manny?!\n\n     The old man stumbles out of the darkness, out of breath.

He uses the belts to lower\n     himself to the nearest pipe.\n\n     Leonard LIGHTS a flare to illuminate the pipe gallery.\n\n     Peter works his way down. The web of pipes seem to recede\n     into Hades.\n\n     The lifeline tightens.\n\n     Peter gets to the last solid footing, lies down on his\n     stomach and lets the belts down.\n\n                          PETER\n                I'm coming, Sus, I'm coming.\n\n     But then, he sees something move below her.

The door opens, and Manny and Peter\n     snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car.\n\n     INSIDE CAR - A LITTLE LATER\n\n     The lower half of the insect has been moved into the car.\n     Susan is reassembling it.\n\n                          PETER\n                So, you're saying this is like those bugs\n                that -- that look like twigs or leaves\n                or...\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (shakes her head)\n                That's camouflage...\n\n     Susan displays the partly-charred head.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                This is mimicry. They evolve to mimic\n                their predators. A butterfly can look\n                like the eyes of an owl.  A catterpillar\n                can copy a snake...\n\n     Susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self-contained\n     bud shape, then pushes back the \"face\" mandibles.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                This has evolved to mimic the most\n                dangerous predator it's ever had...\n\n     She holds it in her hand, like Yorick's skull. The mimic's\n     head obscenely mirrors her own. She inserts it into the\n     shoulder cavity.\n\n     She stands back.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Us.\n\n     CAMERA cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like\n     THE OVERCOAT MAN.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Mantids can mimic.

Red, blue, and orange lines\n     branching through the boroughs like veins.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                All these...they're like tunnels of an\n                insect colony. Once these things hit a\n                certain population density, they'll have\n                to move out, form new colonies.\n\n     The realization hits the others.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                We have to get help down here.  Burn\n                the tunnels before...\n\n     She's interrupted by a CLICKING from the tunnel ahead.\n\n     It's answered by CLICKING from the tunnel behind.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Get the doors!\n\n     A brief glimpse down the car shows too many OTHER DOORS to\n     close in time.\n\n                          PETER\n                Is there a switch?\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Third rail is dead.\n                     (To Manny and Susan.)\n                Get me up.

Many of the doors won't budge.\n\n                          PETER\n                     (hissing a whisper)\n                They're coming!\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     The shadows get nearer, their CLICKING louder...\n\n     CONTROL BOOTH\n\n     Susan looks under the dashboard, finds a HEXAGONAL SHAPED\n     ROD.  The lever crank.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                I got it!\n\n     Susan gives it to Leonard. He JAMS the rod into the hexagonal\n     shaped hole.  Perfect fit.\n\n     Leonard begins CRANKING the thing.  But it's rusty and\n     slow...\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Hurry! Please!\n\n     THROUGHOUT SUBWAY CAR\n\n     The doors begin to swing shut very slowly.\n\n     OUTSIDE - A MIMIC'S POV\n\n     sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.\n\n     CONTROL BOOTH\n\n     Leonard can't crank fast enough.  Susan joins in, putting her\n     hands over Leonard's.  Both spin the thing as fast as\n     possible.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Peter and Manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up\n     the closing process.\n\n     SHADOWS are seen approaching, now very close.\n\n     CONTROL BOOTH\n\n     Leonard and Susan put all their effort into turning the crank\n     one more time...\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Come on, you son-of-a...\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     A SOFT CLICK as the doors SHUT IN UNISON.\n\n     Silence.\n\n     All four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the\n     blast of depth charges.  Their eyes dart to the\n\n     WINDOWS\n\n     caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the\n     red flares.\n\n     THUCK! Something BUMPS against the door.\n\n     A machine-gun patter of FOOTSTEPS on the roof.\n\n     The car SHAKES.\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     The dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.\n\n     INSIDE\n\n     SCREEECH!! Something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a\n     nail over a chalkboard.\n\n     THUMP! THUMP!  Impacts on the sides...\n\n     An obscene symphony of sounds as Mimics lay siege to the car.\n\n     PETER\n\n     A BUZZ OF WINGS catches his attention.  He turns.  His face\n     is reflected in a security window.\n\n     CRACK!  The window SPLINTERS, destroying Peter's reflection.\n\n     ABOVE MANNY\n\n     Claws SCRATCH the ceiling. It begins to dent.\n\n     BELOW SUSAN AND LEONARD\n\n     Large forms CLICKING underneath, looking for a way in.\n\n     Susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of\n     the clicking...\n\n     ...which leads to Leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Oh, God.\n                     (Looks at Leonard.)\n                The blood...\n\n     KLANGGG!  A Mimic leg PIERCES the ceiling above them!\n\n     Susan pulls Leonard out of the way just in time as\n\n     IN THE SUBWAY CAR\n\n     KLANG!  KLANG! More legs break through the ceiling!\n\n     SUSAN AND LEONARD\n\n     emerge from the control booth, Leonard's arm over Susan's\n     shoulder.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                His blood! It's driving them crazy! We\n                have to mask the odor!\n\n                          PETER\n                How?!\n\n     But there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions.\n\n     Leonard pulls off his jacket. Susan begins wrapping it around\n     his wound to mask it. Manny helps.\n\n     Peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken\n     window as a barricade.\n\n     Despite their efforts, the Mimics are not thrown off the\n     scent.\n\n                          PETER\n                It's no use! They know we're in here!\n\n                          SUSAN\n                They don't know anything Peter, they\n                just sense.

Susan just takes the blade.\n\n     The whole car is now shaking and buckling.\n\n     She runs to the Mimic's carcass.  For a moment, she\n     hesitates.  But the pandemonium leaves her little choice.\n\n     She SLICES into the Mimic's corpse with the razor...\n\n                          PETER\n                What are you doing?\n\n     ...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow...\n\n     ...and pulls out two fat AMBER SACS the size of\n     softballs.  She SLICES them open.\n\n     Orange GOO leaks out, its stench overpowering.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                     (covers his nose)\n                Shit!\n\n     Peter looks up as Susan slides one of the sacs over to\n     him.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Rub it on the windows!\n\n                          PETER\n                What-\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Just do it!!\n\n     Holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the\n     crap on the windows, the doorframe...\n\n     MANNY\n\n     looks to the roof, listening.\n\n     And remarkably, the SOUNDS of the Mimics START\n     SUBSIDING.\n\n     Susan comes over to Leonard, begins dabbing the goop on\n     Leonard's wound.  Leonard makes a face at the stink.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                What are you putting that crap on me\n                for?\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to\n                identify themselves to each other.\n\n     She smears the floor area behind Leonard. The activity winds\n     down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n     SUBWAY CAR - LATER\n\n     Leaning against the dirtied window, Manny creates a streak\n     for every Mimic he sees.\n\n     Peter, Leonard and Susan are hard at work. Leonard has\n     created a small \"model\" of the station using pocket debris\n     and the wall map.\n\n                          LEONARD (O.S.)\n                Okay.

We'll be back and\n                find him.\n\n     Manny doesn't respond.\n\n     READY TO GO\n\n     Susan dabs at Peter's face with the last touches of the\n     scent gland substance.  She doesn't meet his eyes as she\n     speaks.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                You're going to have to keep it\n                really slow.  Their eyes react to\n                sudden movements.\n\n     Peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge.  He\n     instinctively goes to wipe his forehead.  Susan stops\n     him.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes,\n                try not to sweat.  They can sense\n                chemical changes...\n\n                          PETER\n                Try not to sweat?\n\n     Leonard turns to Susan and Peter.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Okay, people...\n\n     Leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.\n\n                          LEONARD (OS)\n                ...are we ready for this?\n\n     Susan has her hand on Peter's chest; Peter is taking deep\n     breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat.  It's\n     an odd parody of Lamaze exercise.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                Whatever you do, don't step on the\n                third rail coming back. Six hundred\n                volts'll blow your leg right off.\n\n     A final breath.  He's about as calm as he's going to get.\n\n     He looks at Susan a long moment. He takes her hand.\n\n                          PETER\n                I was just thinking how I could use a\n                pair of pliers... and I remembered where\n                they are...\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (overlapping)\n                That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.\n\n     A sad, nervous smile appears on Peter's face.\n\n                          PETER\n                In the tool box under the kitchen\n                counter...\n\n     Susan kisses him softly on the lips.\n\n     Manny approaches.  Show time.\n\n     Susan steps away from Peter. She looks toward the control\n     booth.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Open it.\n\n     LEONARD\n\n     begins turning the lever crank slowly.\n\n     SUBWAY DOORS\n\n     gradually begin to open, and stop half way.\n\n     The darkness outside is alive with CLICKING.\n\n     PETER AND MANNY\n\n     slowly move between the opening of the door and make their\n     way to\n\n     INT. PLATFORM\n\n     They step onto the dusty concrete.  Come to a stop.\n\n     SUSAN\n\n     watches nervously for the reaction of the Mimics\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     LARGE SHADOWS pass far and near of Peter and Manny; but none\n     of the Mimics seem to care about them one way or the other.\n\n     Peter and Manny exchange looks: a moment of relief.  It's\n     working.\n\n     Peter slowly moves right along the track to the nearby POWER\n     BOX.\n\n     Manny goes left, starts to make a longer journey across the\n     platform to the SWITCH ROOM.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Susan moves away from the door, goes over the Mimic carcass,\n     filled with the bloody bandages.\n\n     PLATFORM - BY THE TRACKS\n\n     Peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering\n     to himself.\n\n     He lowers himself slowly to the track.\n\n     PLATFORM - NEAR THE SWITCHROOM\n\n     Manny moves toward the door.  A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS\n     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.\n\n     BY THE TRACKS\n\n     Peter gets to the track.  He turns\n\n     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!\n\n     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.\n\n     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.\n\n     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.\n\n     SUSAN\n\n     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's\n     midsection.  FSST!  The flare SPARKS alive.\n\n     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics\n     outside.\n\n     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of\n     the car...\n\n     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.\n\n     OUTSIDE\n\n     The other Mimics take instant notice.\n\n     BY PETER\n\n     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,\n     it's gone, heading toward\n\n     THE DEAD MIMIC\n\n     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow\n     into a feeding frenzy.\n\n     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother\n     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Susan watches in disgust.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Choke on it, motherfuckers.\n\n     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to\n     shut.\n\n     PETER\n\n     breathes a sigh of relief.\n\n     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.\n\n     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.\n     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO\n     THE GREEN WIRES.\n\n                          PETER\n                     (to himself)\n                Green...Blue...\n\n     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.\n\n     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic\n     casings having long ago faded into goo.\n\n     INT. SWITCHROOM\n\n     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of\n     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White\n     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s\n     style LAMPS are built into their side.\n\n     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the\n     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.\n\n     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he\n     waves back to LEONARD.\n\n     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands\n     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills\n     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans\n     against the wall.\n\n     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the\n     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.\n\n     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.\n\n     Spoons.\n\n                          MANNY\n                Chuy...?\n\n     Manny follows the sound.\n\n     BY THE TRACK\n\n     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.\n     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance\n     of color.\n\n     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.\n     Breathes...\n\n     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM\n\n     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and\n     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.\n\n     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.\n\n     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet\n     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.\n\n     A RUSTLING behind him.  Manny turns around.\n\n                          MANNY\n                     (Whispering)\n                Nino...\n\n     He swings the light onto Chuy, sitting on the floor before\n     the remains of a RUSTY COLUMN.  That beautiful, emotionless\n     smile on his pale face.\n\n                          MANNY\n                Chuy...\n\n     BY THE POWERBOX\n\n     Peter has made all the necessary connections.  He turns now\n     to the fuse-section.\n\n     A red throw-switch is there, and two big slots for fuses.\n\n     One is still occupied.\n\n     The other one empty.\n\n                          PETER\n                Dammit!\n\n     CU - PETER'S FOREHEAD\n\n     BEADS OF SWEAT begin to form.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Susan watches the Mimics at their feast.\n\n     All of a sudden, they begin to stop, as if losing interest.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (horrified)\n                The scent's fading...\n\n     Susan steps back, looks around desperately for a flashlight.\n\n                          LEONARD\n                     (tense as hell)\n                What's Manny doing? I can't see him\n                anymore.\n\n     ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM\n\n                          MANNY\n                Nino, please...\n\n     Manny slaps his knees with both hands in a parental gesture\n     of \"come to me\".\n\n     In the darkness, something that looks like a PALM FROND\n     floats gracefully down from the ceiling, making see-saw\n     gestures as it falls through the air.\n\n     Manny shines his flashlight on the floor.  It's not a palm\n     frond.\n\n     It's a wing.\n\n     Manny turns his flashlight to the ceiling and walls.\n\n     The place IS COVERED WITH MIMICS.  They are in the middle of\n     a vicious mating ritual.  The males tear savagely at the\n     females wings as they proceed to mount them.  A chaotic\n     clusterfuck.\n\n     Manny is sickened.\n\n     CHUY GIGGLES. Manny shines his light ahead. Manny's face\n     falls.\n\n                          MANNY\n                Dios mio...\n\n     The WHITE PILLAR BEHIND CHUY IS MOVING...\n\n     ...unfolding...\n\n     ...at last revealing...\n\n     AN ALBINO MIMIC!  Another leap for evolution...\n\n     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more\n     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still\n     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to\n     them that at the very least entrance us.\n\n     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny\n     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.\n\n     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.\n\n     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as\n     if trying to communicate with the boy.\n\n     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a\n     perfect imitation of the sound.\n\n     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with\n     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.  He turns to Chuy-\n\n                          MANNY\n                     (barely audible)\n                Chuy...\n\n                          CHUY\n                     (whispers)\n                Friends.\n\n                          MANNY\n                NO, NO, CHUY, NO...\n\n                          CHUY\n                Friends.\n\n     The Albino CLICKS his jaws, moving in toward Manny.\n\n     CHUY\n\n     plays his SPOONS in perfect imitation.\n\n     MANNY\n\n     stands under an archway in a swirl of dust. He raises his\n     arms, like a prophet. He lets go of hsi razor and kneels.\n\n                          MANNY\n                God has closed his eyes. This, he cannot\n                see...\n\n     His vacant eyes, fill with tears, he prays quietly, a strange\n     serenity invades him.\n\n     The Albino's jaws open and charge.\n\n     PLATFORM\n\n     Some Mimics advance toward Peter's direction.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n     Susan desperately waves a flashlight and bangs the window,\n     trying to attract their attention.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Over here! Over here! Goddam you!!\n\n     BY THE TRACKS\n\n     Peter BREAKS the arm off one of his glasses.  He jams it at\n     the empty fuse.  It SPARKS.\n\n     PLATFORM\n\n     THUMP!  The electricity COMES ON...\n\n     The lamps on the columns BURST INTO FLAMES from the power\n     surge.  Fire illuminates the station like a Greek temple.\n\n     BY THE TRACKS\n\n     Peter climbs up onto the tracks...\n\n     ...sweat staining his forehead...\n\n     Peter wipes it and removes the scent coating.\n\n     THE MIMICS\n\n     clearly react, sensing the chemical change, like bees\n     reacting to honey.\n\n     SUBWAY CAR\n\n                          SUSAN\n                     (to Leonard)\n                THE DOOR! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!\n\n     LEONARD\n\n     looks at the now lit control panels, tries to decide which\n     button to press. He begins to press each one in turn.\n\n     PETER\n\n     hears the sound of spoons playing.\n\n     He turns to see Chuy, standing by the outside of the switch\n     room.  The boy smiles. A flashlight shines behind him.\n\n                          PETER\n                Manny...\n\n     But the thing holding the flashlight is anything but human:\n     The ALBINO steps into view, moving eerily like an unstrung\n     puppet. His claws and jaws are coated in blood. Chuy joyfully\n     announces the arrival like a little drummer boy.\n\n     THE MIMICS\n\n     climb over the roof, moving toward the rear of the-\n\n     SUBWAY CAR - CONTROL BOOTH\n\n     Susan runs in.  SLAMS her hand down on a button.\n\n     FSST!\n\n     THE SUBWAY CAR\n\n     The doors open.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Peter!!\n\n     Peter hesitates, takes a step toward Chuy.\n\n                          PETER\n                Come on, kid...\n\n     Chuy seeks shelter behind the Albino's legs.\n\n                          PETER\n                     (horrified)\n                Jesus!\n\n     The albino charges toward him.\n\n                          SUSAN\n                Run!!

SHAFT\n\n     A skeletal framework on each side.  Just enough for a\n     handhold.\n\n     Peter steadies Susan as she climbs in beside him.

Something hits the gate below them!\n\n     INT. BY THE ELEVATOR GATE\n\n     The Mimics are tearing at the metal gate.\n\n     The Albino remains still, watching them work.\n\n     PETER AND SUSAN\n\n     Susan's arm and legs are shaking now.  Her breath starts\n     catching in her throat with the effort.\n\n                          PETER\n                Don't hold your breath!  Keep it going,\n                even flow!\n\n     Susan tried, but can't.

Two of the Mimics and\n     the Albino have gotten into the shaft!\n\n     The Albino is so long it climbs by bracing its legs against\n     opposite walls.\n\n     SUSAN AND PETER\n\n     Susan is crying, barely any strength left.\n\n     Peter does his best to stay in control, but in truth is\n     barely hanging on himself.\n\n     LIGHT hits them from the shaft above now, SOUNDS of PEOPLE\n     TALKING and a muffled P.A.

Susan\n     looks back down.\n\n     SUSAN'S POV - SHAFT\n\n     The Mimics rush up, closer, closer.  The Albino opens its\n     mandibles.\n\n     SUSAN AND PETER\n\n     both KICK at the gate, it gives, Peter pulls Susan through\n     to the\n\n     INT.

ELEVATOR SHAFT\n\n     The Albino sees the elevator approaching from above.\n\n     It gives a few CLICKS to its minions.\n\n     The two other Mimics race up the shaft...\n\n     ...toward the elevator...\n\n     ...and WEDGE THEMSELVES IN ON EITHER SIDE!\n\n     They are CRUSHED instantly.  But the elevator is stopped just\n     above the open gate.\n\n     With just enough room for the Albino to get through to\n\n     INT. SUBWAY TRACKS\n\n     Susan and Peter run.
