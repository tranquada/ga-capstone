The horde of insects appear to be some\n     kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.\n\n<b>     THE TEAM OF FIGURES\n</b>\n     From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a\n     flat WHITE.

A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide\n     through into the area.\n\n<b>     THE NEARBY ROACHES\n</b>\n     react instantaneously.

The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them\n     off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.\n\n<b>     LATER\n</b>\n     A MANHOLE has been opened above.

A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped\n     dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send\n     the cars on crosstown detours.\n\n     Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near\n     dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked\n     in a military phalanx.\n\n     A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the\n     middle of the street, \"sealing\" the area with amber plastic.\n\n     Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches\n     and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.\n\n     The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is\n     off.

PETER TYLER, 34, bespectacled.  A\n     HEADSET around his neck, a coat emblazoned with the\n     DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH logo.  He has the look of a man who's\n     just fought a long battle and come out victorious.\n\n<b>                          SUSAN\n</b>                We'll see...\n\n     He offers her a bite of a PAY DAY CANDYBAR.  Susan smiles,\n     shakes her head.

He\n     bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a\n     loose board to save himself from falling.\n\n     The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the\n     edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.\n\n     He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push\n     with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.\n\n<b>     BELOW\n</b>\n     Cans bounce off the pavement.

A large WINDOW OF DUSTY GLASS\n     reflects his image...and the distant ones of the Mimics.\n\n<b>     BY THE TRACKS\n</b>\n     Peter gets to the track.  He turns\n\n     And is met FACE TO FACE WITH A MIMIC!\n\n     Its antennae move toward his head, curious.\n\n     Its human-mask face plate clicks apart and together.\n\n     Peter remains stock still.  He starts breathing deeply...\n\n<b>     SUBWAY CAR\n</b>\n     Leonard has now fully opened the doors.\n\n<b>     SUSAN\n</b>\n     pulls the tipcase of the FLARE tied to the dead Mimic's\n     midsection.

The flare SPARKS alive.\n\n     The sudden light draws the attention of several Mimics\n     outside.\n\n     Susan pushes the carcass toward an open door at the front of\n     the car...\n\n     ...and with a HEAVE, throws it onto the front track.\n\n<b>     OUTSIDE\n</b>\n     The other Mimics take instant notice.\n\n<b>     BY PETER\n</b>\n     The Mimic before him suddenly turns.  In a flash of speed,\n     it's gone, heading toward\n\n<b>     THE DEAD MIMIC\n</b>\n     stuffed with the bloody rage, the thing sends its fellow\n     into a feeding frenzy.\n\n     The other Mimics begin TEARING into it, ripping their brother\n     to shreds in cannibalistic orgy.\n\n<b>     SUBWAY CAR\n</b>\n     Susan watches in disgust.\n\n<b>                          SUSAN\n</b>                Choke on it, motherfuckers.\n\n     Leonard turns the lever crank again.  The doors begin to\n     shut.\n\n<b>     PETER\n</b>\n     breathes a sigh of relief.\n\n     He goes to the powerbox, opens it up.\n\n     He shines his flashlight down on the back of his hand.\n     The simple chart tells him what to wire:  BLUE WIRES TO\n<b>     THE GREEN WIRES.\n</b>\n<b>                          PETER\n</b>                     (to himself)\n                Green...Blue...\n\n     He looks back up at the powerbox.  His face falls.\n\n     All the wires are a GROSS BROWN, their colored plastic\n     casings having long ago faded into goo.\n\n<b>     INT. SWITCHROOM\n</b>\n     Manny enters. The space is even more dusty than the rest of\n     the station. Spiderwebs strung over old machinery.  White\n     Doric PILLARS support the ceiling like skeletal bones.  1940s\n     style LAMPS are built into their side.\n\n     Manny looks around.  Off to the right, right next to the\n     rusted track switch board, he heads for the COUPLING SWITCH.\n\n     Once there, he rests and, through the murky windows, he\n     waves back to LEONARD.\n\n     He pulls out his pills box and takes a pill. But his hands\n     are shaking, under enormous tension. Some of the pills\n     scatter on the floor. He puts the box away and leans\n     against the wall.\n\n     A CLICKING nearby catches his attention, echoing from the\n     entrance of ANOTHER ROOM.\n\n     It is not the sound of the Mimics; but rather, of METAL.\n\n     Spoons.\n\n<b>                          MANNY\n</b>                Chuy...?\n\n     Manny follows the sound.\n\n<b>     BY THE TRACK\n</b>\n     Peter desperately tries to connect the wires the right way.\n     He wipes off the brown gunk, tries to discern any semblance\n     of color.\n\n     He feels himself start to sweat.  He tries to relax.\n     Breathes...\n\n<b>     INT. ROOM BEHIND SWITCHROOM\n</b>\n     The space is larger than the switchroom.  The walls and\n     ceiling have an odd, shiny consistency.\n\n     Manny heads in further, locates the levers and waits.\n\n     Something pale and small emerges from the dark, a few feet\n     away, a face that seems to float in the eerie half-light.\n\n     A RUSTLING behind him.

Another leap for evolution...\n\n     Its form is different from the other Mimics.  Sleeker, more\n     supple, almost beautiful.  And while its movements are still\n     not completely human, there is a kind of unearthly grace to\n     them that at the very least entrance us.\n\n     The thing raises itself to full height, dwarfing the tiny\n     boy.  It stands over him like a king over his court fool.\n\n     Chuy giggles happily.  It's all a game to him.\n\n     The Albino CLICKS in response -- a long, leisurely sound, as\n     if trying to communicate with the boy.\n\n     Chuy pulls his spoons out and begins to play them, making a\n     perfect imitation of the sound.\n\n     Manny starts to tremble as the creature gazes upon him with\n     huge, expressionless 'eyes'.
