It will extend to wide screen (1.1 - 85) at\n\tSequence 41, while still remaining in black and white.  At\n\tSequence 54 the film changes to colour.\n\n15\tNow read \"Denton Episcopalian Church\".\n\n23\tBrad and Janet will arrive at the gate entrance to Oakley Court.\n\tThis deletes a later reference to gates in 33.  From hereon ignore\n\tall references to rock formations etc., as the grounds of\n\tOakley Court are the only location involved in the approach to the\n\thouse.\n\n25\tThree motorbikes drive past Brad and disappear around the house.\n\n26\tThis window will be in turret in Oakley Court.  Ignore all\n\treferences to adjoining 'massive lighted window'.\n\n30\tThis shot will be of a Gryphem on the Oakley Court facade.\n\n32\tThis will be of some similar detail to the above.\n\n38\t\"Stairway\" references now allude to the front entrance hall of\n\tOakley Court.\n\n40\tDelete references to \"mirrors reflecting to infinity\".\n\n47\tColumbia now is astride a Juke Box.  The band are cut.\n\n54a\tRed streamers and Black and White balloons fall.  Not just\n\tstreamers.\n\n69\tAll future references to the operating table in the Lab now\n\tshould be applied either to the TANK or the vaulting horse\n\t(part of the gymnasium equipment) - whichever is applicable.\n\n75\tDelete references to the Ice-block.  Eddie now crashes\n\tthrough a wall of Coca Cola bottles and ice.  He is also equipped\n\twith a saxaphone rather than a guitar.\n\n87a\tRocky now escapes through the lift shaft.  This may involve\n\ta shot from the vestibule showing Rocky climbing out of lift\n\tcage and running out of the house.  It may also involve the\n\tdouble bed in the bridal suite collapsing during the escape\n\tsequence.\n\n91\tIt is still raining.\n\n92\tJanet is now stumbling around the staircase in Oakley Court.\n\n103\tThis sequence may now also involve Riff-Raff, Magenta,\n\tColumbia, Frank, Brad and selected Transylvanians.\n\n106\tWill now have Frank, Riff-Raff, and Brad entering the Lab\n\tin the lift cage.\n\n108\tIt is still raining.\n\n116\tDr Scott will now break through the tiled wall of the laboratory\n\ton the area of ramp above the control panel.\n\n117\tMagenta will now appear through the broken tile area created\n\tby Dr Scott.\n\n122/140 This sequence will be altered to Dr Scott holding a\n\tphotograph album containing a still photograph equivalent\n\tof the \"flashbacks\" referred to in this sequence.\n\n143/4\tAll entrances to the Lab will be via the broken tiled entrance.\n\n\tDelete all references to the floor lowering.\n\n147\tThe \"secret passage\" is now the broken tile entrance.\n\n164\tFrank tries to scale up the silver drapes which descend on\n\thim with Tab tracks, rope supports, etc.\n\n \n--=={{****************************************************************}}==--\n\n\n\nMEMO:  SCRIPT ALTERATIONS\n\nFROM:  JIM SHARMAN\t\t\t\t9.12.74\n\nTO:    ALL CONCERNED.\n\n\nSc. 148  INT.
