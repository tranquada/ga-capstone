She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the\n\twalk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from\n\tthe keychain.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>5\tEXT.

JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the\n\tlock on each window. She stands for a moment.\n\n\tShe picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge\n\tand takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and\n\ta jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.\n\tShe thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.\n\n\tShe takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.\n\n<b>6B\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tShe hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely\n\tfurnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the\n\twindows, then climbs into bed with the food.\n\n\tOn the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at\n\tone of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.\n\n\tOutside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going\n\tplaces. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns\n\toff the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the\n\troom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>6C\tINT.

I can't.\n\n\tHolding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's\n\ta soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of\n\ta drawer and starts down the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(fatalistic)\n\t\t\tLet's just do it.\n\n\tShe moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.\n\tIt sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.\n\n<b>6F\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tThere's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.\n\n\tShe turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.\n\n<b>\tINT THE CLOSET\n</b>\n\tKARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a\n\tbox of shoes.

STAIRWAY - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tJulie climbs to the top of the stairs. She passes Ray in the bathroom.\n\tShe pauses in the doorway --\n\n<b>107B\tINT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tRay is at the sink in boxer shorts. He's using an electric Waterpic\n\tdevicice that has just been opened, a gift from the party. It makes a\n\tlow WHIRRING sound.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n</b>\t\t\t\t(seeing her)\n\t\t\tChecking the locks again?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n</b>\t\t\tYou know me to well.\n\n\tJulie smile and walks to the bedroom.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>107C\tINT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tJulie climbs into bed with a book. The bedroom is clean and orderly.\n\tThe windows are closed. The closet door is shut.\n\n\tThe room is decorated simply: a high antique bed; unopened boxes; a\n\thighboy; an antique mirror leaning against the wall. A stuffed bear\n\tsits in a chair.\n\n\tThere is a CLATTER from another room. Julie freezes. She waits. She\n\thears it again. She climbs out of bed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>107D\tINT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tJulie walks into the dark spare bedroom. The CLATTERING SOUND comes\n\tfrom the open window. The wind is blowing the blinds.\n\n\tJulie relaxes. She shuts the window. As she leaves the room, we notice\n\tthe dirty imprint of a boot below the window.\n\n<b>107E\tINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tJulie passes Ray who is still absorbed with the new toy.\n\n\tBehind him, the door softly closes. The lock twists. Ray is oblivious,\n\thappy being the dental-hygene pacesetter of the household.\n\n<b>107F\tINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tJulie enters the room. She looks at the closet door. It is open a\n\tcrack. She hesitates, trying to remember if it was open before -- it\n\twasn't.\n\n\tJulie approaches the closet. She catches her refelction in the mirror\n\tnext to the closet. She peers into the crack of the closet. She can't\n\tsee anything. She throws open the closet door.\n\n<b>\tNOTHING\n</b>\n\tShe looks around the room.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n</b>\t\t\tWhat is my problem?\n\n\tShe sits down on the bed.\n\n\tWe see her bare feet from under the bed.\n\n\tShe smiles, relaxes. She looks in the mirror leaning against the wall.\n\tSomething has caught her eye. She freezes. She turns slowly back to\n\tthe reflection in the mirror. She sees the glint of steel --\n\n<b>\tA HOOK -- CRASH ZOOM INTO REFLECTION --\n</b>\n<b>\tTHE FISHERMAN CROUCHING UNDER HER BED\n</b>\n\tJulie turns too late --\n\n\tThe fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs. Julie screams. She goes\n\tdown --\n\n\tHer nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the\n\tbed.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO BLACK:\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/I-Still-Know-What-You-Did-Last-Summer.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>I Still Know What You Did Last Summer</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Trey Callaway\" title=\"Scripts by Trey Callaway\">Trey Callaway</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Mystery\" title=\"Mystery Scripts\">Mystery</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/I Still Know What You Did Last Summer Script.html#comments\" title=\"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:07:49.566965"}
