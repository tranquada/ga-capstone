But\n\tshe's all alone in the house of the Lord.\n\n\tAnd those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden\n\tstill rests upon her soul.\n\n\tShe reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained\n\tCONFESSIONAL BOOTH.\n\n2\tINT.

This is difficult for her.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI've never told anyone this. Not my\n\t\t\tmom, not the poice, not even my\n\t\t\tfriends -- except for the ones who\n\t\t\twere there and they...well they're\n\t\t\tnot around anymore.

A chill shoots through her\n\tbody.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tYou know? But how could you...\n\n\tClouds of icy steam shoot through the partition.

I mean, it's not\n\t\t\tlike this was the first time I\n\t\t\tfreaked out in class. I hardly ever\n\t\t\tget a full night's sleep, my grades\n\t\t\tsuck, I'm this close from being thrown\n\t\t\tout of school.\n\n\tBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! EXPLOSIONS. Julie jumps out of her skin. It's just\n\tSTUDENTS letting off FIRECRACKERS as they fly past on bicycles.\n\n\tWill and Julie are now thinking the same thing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\t\t(cont'd)\n\t\t\tIt was one year ago...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWILL\n\t\t\tIt's...the anniversary.

Julie watches him a beat, then turns down her walk --\n\n\tRAY\n\n\tsteps out of the shadows. Julie practically faints.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tOh, my god, Ray. You scared me.\n\n\tRecovering, she hugs Ray, genuinely glad to see him. He's a bit cold.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tI got in early.

You're right. Are\n\t\t\tyou ready to go? I've got the old\n\t\t\ttruck. You know the drill...Crab\n\t\t\tboil at Ollie's. Croaker Queen\n\t\t\tPageant...It's only small-town fun,\n\t\t\tbut it's still nice. People really\n\t\t\tmiss you. I miss you.\n\n\tShe looks at Ray, his compassionate demeanor. This is hard to say --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\t\t(softly, but resolved)\n\t\t\tRay, I can't...\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tCan't what?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tI just feel like some part of me\n\t\t\thasn't healed up enough to go back.\n\t\t\tLike some critical piece is missing.\n\t\t\tPlease understand...\n\n\tRay is cold. This is what he's expected all along.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tI understand something.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tIt's not like that. It's not you.\n\t\t\tIt's me. My head.

My boat's in\n\t\t\tSouthport, remember? But, I get it.\n\t\t\tYou need your space from Craokerland.\n\t\t\tAnd maybe from me, too.\n\n\tRay starts walking away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY (cont'd)\n\t\t\tYou know where to find me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tRay? Ray? At least come up for a\n\t\t\twhile.\n\n\tRay keeps on walking.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAY\n\t\t\tIt's okay. I'm just gonna go.\n\n\tJulie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block\n\ther way.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tRay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...\n\t\t\t\t(to herself)\n\t\t\tI'm just scared...that's all.\n\n\tBut Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns\n\tquickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the\n\twalk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from\n\tthe keychain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n5\tEXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\n\tStudents throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck,\n\twhich is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW.\n\n\tHe clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket\n\tand pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He\n\tthrows it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n6\tINT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY\n\n\tJulie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She\n\tstands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a\n\tcat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen.\n\n6A\tINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tThe faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the\n\tlock on each window. She stands for a moment.\n\n\tShe picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge\n\tand takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and\n\ta jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf.\n\tShe thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet.\n\n\tShe takes the whole mess toward her bedroom.\n\n6B\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY\n\n\tShe hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely\n\tfurnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the\n\twindows, then climbs into bed with the food.\n\n\tOn the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at\n\tone of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing.\n\n\tOutside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going\n\tplaces. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns\n\toff the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the\n\troom.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDISSOVE TO:\n\n6C\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJulie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed.\n\n\tThere's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER.\n\n\tJulie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the\n\tfront door being CLOSED.\n\n\tHer arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb\n\tPOPS.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\t\t(whispers)\n\t\t\tOkay. Okay. Face your fears...\n\n\tShe gets off the bed and stands still.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(whisper)\n\t\t\tThere's nothing...\n\n\tThere's another NOISE down the hall.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(whisper)\n\t\t\tQuiet.\n\n\tJulie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen.\n\n6D\tINT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n\tShe gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the\n\tliving room. She steps through the kitchen door.\n\n\tAs she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway\n\ttoward her bedroom.\n\n6E\tINT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThere's NO ONE there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tOkay, calm down, imagination.\n\n\tShe relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light\n\tfrom the hallway slanting through.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\tI can't take this anymore. I can't.\n\n\tHolding the knife in front of her, she tiptoes to the hallway. There's\n\ta soft RUSTLING coning from her bedroom. She gets a flashlight out of\n\ta drawer and starts down the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE (cont'd)\n\t\t\t\t(fatalistic)\n\t\t\tLet's just do it.\n\n\tShe moves faster toward her bedroom. she listens outside the doorway.\n\tIt sounds like someone's in the closet. She moves into the room.\n\n6F\tINT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThere's a noise in the darkened closet. Julie moves into position.\n\n\tShe turns the flashlight ON and lunges for the closet.\n\n\tINT THE CLOSET\n\n\tKARLA WILSON, 19, all grace and attitude, is on tiptoes reaching for a\n\tbox of shoes. She SCREAMS.\n\n\tJulie SCREAMS. They both SCREAM together. Julie drops the knife and\n\tflashlight.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARLA\n\t\t\tI thought you were out of town!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing in my closet?\n\n\tThey hug, jumping up and down with relief.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARLA\n\t\t\tI thought you were out of town!\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tWhat are you doing in my closet?\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARLA\n\t\t\ti just wanted your black pants, but\n\t\t\tI'm not ready to die for them!\n\n\tJulie turns on the light in the hallway. Karla has her shoes in her\n\thand and black pants draped over her arm.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tThat was heart attack time, Karla.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARLA\n\t\t\tNo. When I put these skinny pants on\n\t\t\tmy body...Now, that's heart attack\n\t\t\ttime.\n\n\tKarla looks down and sees the knife. She picks it up with two\n\tfingers --\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKARLA (cont'd)\n\t\t\tAnd we're going to put away the\n\t\t\tutensils and you're coming with me.\n\n\tJulie flops down on her bed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tJULIE\n\t\t\tI'm not going anywhere.

This is TYRELL MARTIN,\n\t23, handsome, no pretention, a little dangerous, with a killer smile.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTYRELL\n\t\t\tYou know what I want to do to you\n\t\t\t...right now, don't you?
