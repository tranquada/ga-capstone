JOHN AND ANN MILLANEY'S HOUSE -- DAY\n</b><b>          \n</b>               Ann, dressed in some of John's work clothes (old cotton shirt,\n               khaki pants) is cleaning the house. Not cleaning like a normal\n               person, but like an obsessive/compulsive person. Scrubbing spots\n               that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over\n               and over, etc. Suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout\n               of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. Shutting the machine\n               off, Ann turns it over and sees that Cynthia's diamond stud\n               earring has gotten hooked in the take-up roller.\n<b>          \n</b>               Ann stares at Cynthia's earring for a long moment.\n<b>          \n</b><b>               CUT TO:\n</b><b>          \n</b>               Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having\n               sex with John.

She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a\n               diamond.\n<b>          \n</b>               Ann looks down at herself. Suddenly realizing that she is\n               dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and\n               pants from her body as though the material were burning her\n               skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.\n<b>          \n</b>               Clothed only in her bra and underwear, Ann sits in the middle\n               of the bedroom floor, arms around herself.\n<b>          \n</b><b>          43   EXT.

Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead\n               her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.\n<b>          \n</b>               Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly\n               at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits\n               down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of\n               water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann\n               holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.\n<b>          \n</b><b>                                   GRAHAM\n</b>                         It's bottled, not tap.\n<b>          \n</b>               A weak smile from Ann.
