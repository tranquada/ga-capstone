He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, \n               also unrumpled.\n\n<b>               IN THE KITCHEN\n</b>\n               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted \n               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the \n               hogs, while he glimpses something coming.\n\n<b>               THE BOY'S POV\n</b>\n               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is \n               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers \n               glance up at William, their faces grim...\n\n               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors \n               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart \n               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where \n               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the \n               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt \n               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.\n\n<b>                                     CAMPBELL\n</b>                         William... Come down here, lad.\n\n               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... \n               but the bodies are still there.\n\n<b>               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n</b>\n               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The \n               undertaker arrives in his hearse.\n\n<b>               INT. THE SHED - DAY\n</b>\n               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is \n               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the \n               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.\n\n               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and \n               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but \n               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.\n\n               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to \n               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.\n\n               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the \n               blood. But the wounds remain.\n\n<b>               EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY\n</b>\n               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We \n               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see \n               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, \n               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as \n               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes \n               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.\n\n               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.\n\n               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's \n               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but \n               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.\n\n               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his \n               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a \n               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her \n               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of \n               death and might suck her parents in too.\n\n<b>                                     PRIEST\n</b>                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.\n\n               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, \n               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment \n               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.\n\n               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so \n               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its \n               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a \n               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a \n               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and \n               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.\n\n               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue \n               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.\n\n               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill \n               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, \n               he looks like the grim reaper.\n\n               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches \n               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE \n               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, \n               permanently furious.\n\n<b>                                     PRIEST\n</b>                         You must be the relative of the \n                         deceased...

They are \n               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a \n               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are \n               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...\n\n<b>                                     ARGYLE\n</b>                         You were wise to hurry.\n\n               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down \n               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque.\n\n<b>                                     LEADER\n</b>                         Someone dead from this household?\n\n<b>                                     ARGYLE\n</b>                         We just had a funeral, isn't that \n                         what it means in England as well?\n\n<b>                                     LEADER\n</b>                         What it means in England -- and in \n                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have \n                         forfeited their lands.

Then a mangled \n               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William \n               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his \n               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they \n               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches \n               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding \n               hand.\n\n               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother \n               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are \n               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads \n               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.\n\n               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and\n\n<b>               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM\n</b>\n               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still \n               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle.\n\n<b>               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be \n               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- \n               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to\n\n<b>               THE KITCHEN\n</b>\n               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a \n               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He \n               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the \n               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a \n               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out \n               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind.\n\n<b>               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound \n               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the \n               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he \n               realizes this, then forces himself on.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The pipes wail an ancient \n               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody \n               known to us as \"Amazing Grace.\" Uncle Argyle has heard them \n               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the \n               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances \n               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William \n               whispers...\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         What are they doing?\n\n<b>                                     ARGYLE\n</b>                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- \n                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed \n                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes.\n\n               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each \n               whispering his own private prayer.

It \n               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging \n               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising \n               towards the stars...\n\n<b>               EXT.

Historians of his day considered him and the line \n               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.\n\n<b>                                     VOICE OVER\n</b>                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had \n                         chosen a relative of his rival, the \n                         king of France.\n\n               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty \n               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her \n               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her \n               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control.\n\n               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men \n               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and \n               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.\n\n<b>                                     VOICE OVER\n</b>                         It was widely whispered that for the \n                         Princess to conceive, Longshanks \n                         would have to do the honors himself. \n                         That may have been what he had in \n                         mind all along.\n\n               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's \n               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince \n               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted \n               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new \n               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes \n               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.\n\n<b>                                     VOICE OVER\n</b>                         Having seen to his obligations to \n                         provide for a successor, Longshanks \n                         set about his fondest business -- to \n                         crush Scotland, and turn his power \n                         against France...\n\n<b>               CLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES\n</b>\n               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.\n\n<b>                                     LONGSHANKS\n</b>                         Scotland!

Grown now, a \n               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, \n               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled \n               power. He looks dangerous.\n\n               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.\n\n               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he \n               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the \n               scene.

With a rock.\n\n               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture \n               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return \n               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.\n\n               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.\n\n               The farmers watch him come.\n\n               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not \n               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young \n               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long \n               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her \n               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a \n               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, \n               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William \n               notice her too.\n\n               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to \n               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.\n\n<b>                                     FARM WOMAN\n</b>                         ...William? It's William Wallace, \n                         back home! -- Have you met my \n                         daughter?\n\n               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to \n               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright \n               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But \n               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand \n               and gives her a respectful bow.\n\n               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like \n               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He \n               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember \n               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes \n               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.\n\n               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about \n               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth \n               at Williams' feet.\n\n               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, \n               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's \n               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle \n               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him \n               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         Hamish?\n\n               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put \n               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         Test of manhood.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         You win.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                              (blocks him)\n                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. \n                         The English won't let us train with \n                         weapons, so we train with stones.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         The test of a soldier is not in his \n                         arm. It's here.\n\n               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to \n               show William something in his palm.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         No. It's here.\n\n               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's \n               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, \n               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders \n               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands \n               over William, waiting for him to get up.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         A contest, then.\n\n               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in \n               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to \n               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are \n               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run \n               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the \n               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         I still say this is no test.

He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone \n               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.\n\n               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         Can you do it when it matters? As it \n                         matters in battle?

Come, do it.\n\n               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts \n               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands \n               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         You'll move\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         I will not.\n\n               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.\n\n<b>                                     FARMER STEWART\n</b>                         That's not fair!\n\n<b>                                     CAMPBELL\n</b>                         He's tired, he should get a longer \n                         run.\n\n               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a \n               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.\n\n               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and \n               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's \n               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. \n               William never flinches. The people cheer.\n\n<b>                                     CAMPBELL\n</b>                         Brave show!\n\n               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         I threw longer than last time!\n\n<b>                                     CAMPBELL\n</b>                         An ox is strong, but not clever.\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand \n                         in one place.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         That's not the point.\n\n               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and \n               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the \n               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         That is.\n\n               Everybody cheers and laughs!

Their cart turned over.\n\n               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily \n               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, \n               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In \n               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, \n               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.\n\n<b>                                     NOBLEMAN\n</b>                         I have come to claim the right of \n                         prima noctes.

She grabs her father and whispers to him. She \n               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, \n               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. \n               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's \n               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more \n               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a \n               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is \n               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.\n\n               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins \n               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the \n               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, \n               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She starts \n               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he \n               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops \n               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away.\n\n               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he \n               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, \n               the one she gave him years before.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She stops, looking at white lace and cloth.\n\n               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly \n               she withdraws his note, and reads:\n\n<b>               INSERT - HIS NOTE\n</b>\n               Tonight. By the trees.\n\n<b>               EXT.

She fetches a bundle she's stashed \n               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off.\n\n<b>               EXT.

THE CHURCH - NIGHT\n</b>\n               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by \n               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, \n               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The \n               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is \n               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as \n               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.\n\n               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she \n               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches \n               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this \n               moment.\n\n               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest.\n\n<b>                                     PRIEST\n</b>                         You have come to pledge, each to the \n                         other, before Almighty God.\n\n               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth \n               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand \n               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         I will love you my whole life. You \n                         and no other.\n\n               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered \n               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those \n               years ago.\n\n<b>                                     MARION\n</b>                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.\n\n               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're \n               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest \n               intones holy phrases...\n\n<b>                                     PRIEST\n</b>                         Agus bhayd lauch...

As they break their embrace, a figure \n               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door \n               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the \n               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.\n\n<b>                                     PRIEST\n</b>                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him \n                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.\n\n               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive \n               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into \n               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges \n               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE\n\n               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, \n               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their \n               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their \n               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn.\n\n               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we\n\n<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Marion moves along a table \n               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging \n               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his \n               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks \n               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she \n               remembers to conceal it.

Then he snatches her again and \n               kisses her hard on the lips.\n\n               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw \n               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her \n               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over \n               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale \n               public gang rape.

Run!\n\n               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws \n               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it \n               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William \n               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of \n               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!\n\n               William pauses out in the central street of the village, \n               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts \n               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; \n               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval \n               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.\n\n               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down \n               at his mangled soldiers.

Stop her!\n\n               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and \n               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's \n               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even \n               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...\n\n               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there \n               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden \n               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.\n\n               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught \n               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward \n               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching \n               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.\n\n<b>               WILLIAM\n</b>\n               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the \n               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've \n               lost him.

They stand to shoot at him with their \n               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...\n\n               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch \n               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as \n               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's \n               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly \n               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the \n               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!\n\n               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his \n               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's \n               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a \n               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder \n               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two \n               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.\n\n<b>               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV\n</b>\n               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, \n               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; \n               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next \n               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the \n               broadsword, a man dies.\n\n               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from \n               the village, follow in his wake.\n\n<b>               EXT.

And then they hear the horses, \n               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The \n               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.\n\n               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on \n               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!\n\n               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.\n\n               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues.\n\n               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters.\n\n               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         No!

Wallace \n               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat \n               with the sword.\n\n<b>               ON THE OTHER SCOTS\n</b>\n               Silenced by what they've just seen and done.

Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.\n\n<b>               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE\n</b>\n               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to \n               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower \n               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they \n               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in \n               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!\n\n               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground \n               literally shakes with the charge.\n\n               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to \n               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH \n               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the \n               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...\n\n               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Steady!

Their \n               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum \n               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on \n               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale \n               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.\n\n<b>               TALMADGE\n</b>\n               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN \n               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.\n\n<b>               WALLACE AND HIS MEN\n</b>\n               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and \n               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen \n               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still \n               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull \n               up their mounts.

Wallace is relentless; each time he \n               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight \n               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old \n               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English \n               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but \n               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs \n               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin \n               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.\n\n               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a \n               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable \n               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; \n               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, \n               his hair, and his brain.\n\n               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining \n               English General tries to save the army.\n\n<b>                                     GENERAL\n</b>                         We are still five thousand!

The English soldiers are \n               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.\n\n               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not \n               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing \n               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow \n               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!\n\n               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies \n               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on \n               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.\n\n               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders \n               of his men.\n\n<b>                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS\n</b>                         Wal-lace!

At the rear of the \n               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained \n               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he \n               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment \n               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a \n               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in \n               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, \n               and fingers the cloth she gave him.\n\n<b>               INT.

Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert \n               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the \n               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig...\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Does anyone know his politics?\n\n<b>                                     CRAIG\n</b>                         No. But his weight with the commoners \n                         could unbalance everything.

Wallace is frozen, his \n               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. His men rush forward.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b><b>                         STOP! NOT YET!

For all else, no mercy.\n\n               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the \n               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace \n               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.\n\n<b>               INT.

He approaches the \n               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, \n               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks \n               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the \n               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his \n               nephew, York's (former) Governor.\n\n<b>                                     PHILLIP\n</b>                         Sire!

He moves to Phillip and \n               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.\n\n               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the \n               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories \n               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.\n\n               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at \n               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, \n               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.\n\n               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, \n               parrying, letting his arms be cut.\n\n<b>                                     LONGSHANKS\n</b>                         You fight back at last!\n\n               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples \n               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the \n               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He \n               exhausts his fury on him.\n\n               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.\n\n               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the \n               discussion, as if this fight was normal business.\n\n<b>                                     LONGSHANKS\n</b>                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him \n                         off.

And not you, the sight of my \n                         faggot son would only encourage an \n                         enemy to take over this country.

WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY\n</b>\n               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase \n               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.\n\n               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, \n               who receives a report from a scout.\n\n<b>                                     CAMPBELL\n</b>                         A royal entourage comes, flying \n                         banners of truce, and the standards \n                         of Longshanks himself!\n\n               Wallace buckles on his sword.\n\n<b>               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY\n</b>\n               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men \n               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent.\n\n               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no \n               threatening moves.\n\n               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle \n               of his broadsword, ready.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Longshanks! I have come.\n\n               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, \n               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the \n               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only \n               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and \n               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another \n               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves \n               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!\n\n               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!\n\n               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more \n               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she \n               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.\n\n               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, \n               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.\n\n               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she \n               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.\n\n               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive \n               yet proud curtsey.\n\n<b>                                     PRINCESS\n</b>                         I am the Princess of Wales.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?\n\n               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.\n\n<b>                                     PRINCESS\n</b>                         I come as the king's servant, and \n                         with his authority.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         It's battle I want, not talk.\n\n<b>                                     PRINCESS\n</b>                         But now that I am here, will you \n                         speak with a woman?\n\n               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading \n               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous \n               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg \n               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and \n               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, \n               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, \n               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots \n               surround the tent, ready for ambush.\n\n               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, \n               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The \n               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower \n               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.\n\n               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.\n\n<b>                                     PRINCESS\n</b>                         I understand that you have recently \n                         been given the rank of knight.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         I have been given nothing.

And it's nasty ground; one \n               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English \n               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick \n               smoke to hide their movements.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Stephen ready?\n\n<b>                                     HAMISH\n</b>                         Aye.\n\n               The Priest from their home village is moving through the \n               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two \n               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, \n               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to \n               join the schiltrons.\n\n<b>               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS\n</b>\n               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.\n\n<b>               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS\n</b>\n               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking \n               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!\n\n               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He \n               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some \n               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Irish troops!\n\n<b>               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY\n</b>\n               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears \n               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.\n\n<b>                                     STEPHEN\n</b>                         So that's where Longshanks got his \n                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill \n                         Scottish cousins for the English.\n\n<b>                                     WILLIAM\n</b>                         Their families are starving, they'll \n                         feed them however they can.

Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, \n               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, \n               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know \n               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the \n               English heavy cavalry advancing.\n\n<b>                                     STEPHEN\n</b>                         They can't be that stupid to attack \n                         the schiltrons again.\n\n               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English \n               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, \n               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         It's only a faint to shield the \n                         crossbows!\n\n               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the \n               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you \n               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the \n               front ranks of the schiltrons.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!\n\n               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers \n               with ten war dogs.\n\n               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp \n               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long \n               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their \n               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the \n               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash \n               the dogs, fear races through the English line.\n\n               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, \n               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, \n               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; \n               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked \n               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing.\n\n               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay \n               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, \n               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and \n               are regrouping.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Now!

The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are \n               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and \n               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his \n               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen \n               and the infantrymen race behind him.\n\n               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace \n               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with \n               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another...\n\n               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, \n               hacking the knights as they run by.\n\n               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the \n               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; \n               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the \n               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, \n               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.\n\n<b>               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND\n</b>\n               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.\n\n<b>                                     GENERAL\n</b>                         My God, and still they come!\n\n<b>                                     LONGSHANKS\n</b>                         Use the reinforcements!

He hacks men down left and right, reaches the \n               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another \n               soldier. Wallace dismounts.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Hamish! Ham --\n\n               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen \n               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and \n               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace \n               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish...\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         Get him away!\n\n               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward \n               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the \n               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.\n\n               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then \n               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         A charge! Form up! Form up!\n\n               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.\n\n               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder \n               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight \n               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.\n\n               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp \n               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending \n               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...\n\n               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The \n               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over \n               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams \n               into him, William also unseats the rider.\n\n               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet \n               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.\n\n               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, \n               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he \n               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of \n               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the \n               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.\n\n               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He \n               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him \n               absolution.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         Fight me! Fight me!\n\n               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged \n               as he screams.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b><b>                         FIGHT ME!\n</b>\n               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being \n               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a \n               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.\n\n               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!\n\n               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to \n               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!\n\n               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out \n               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen \n               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him \n               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, \n               as Stephen mounts too.\n\n               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to \n               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see \n               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the \n               Scots.\n\n               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire \n               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have \n               died along with his heart.\n\n<b>               LONGSHANKS\n</b>\n               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the \n               Scottish dead.

As he \n               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a \n               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill.

But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy \n               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from \n               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize \n               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they \n               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.\n\n               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place \n               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on \n               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand \n               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. \n               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside.\n\n<b>               EXT.

And then \n               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and \n               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking \n               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and \n               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is \n               silhouetted, and he can see her.\n\n               The lone rider is William Wallace.\n\n<b>               CLOSE - A CANDLE\n</b>\n               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into \n               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns \n               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.\n\n<b>               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS\n</b>\n               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.\n\n<b>               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE\n</b>\n               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared \n               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.\n\n               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the \n               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside.\n\n               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first \n               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for \n               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them \n               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the \n               implications of this moment.\n\n               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through \n               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each \n               other in the darkness.

Tears roll \n               down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, \n               Wallace rides away.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. \n               Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto \n               Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters \n               drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace.\n\n               English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, \n               and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if \n               broadswords might spring from his boots.\n\n               They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the \n               Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out \n               the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs \n               the English Captain of the soldiers.\n\n<b>                                     ROBERT\n</b>                         He is not to be harmed.

But \n                         before death comes to you, know this: \n                         your blood dies with you. A child \n                         who is not of your line grows in my \n                         belly. Your son will not sit long on \n                         the throne. I swear it.\n\n               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back \n               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband \n               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the \n               dying king rasping the air like a saw.\n\n<b>               EXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY\n</b>\n               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer \n               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped \n               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through \n               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: \n               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.\n\n               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in \n               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street \n               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.\n\n               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing \n               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest \n               of the crowd jeers more.\n\n               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution \n               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table \n               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an \n               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         We will use it all before this is \n                         over.

Wallace is \n               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows \n               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...\n\n<b>               WE INTERCUT:\n</b>\n               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE \n               from her room in the palace...\n\n               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, \n               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.\n\n               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.\n\n               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in \n               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered \n               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.\n\n<b>               ON THE EXECUTION STAND\n</b>\n               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around \n               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.\n\n<b>                                     CROWD\n</b>                         That's it!

The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the \n               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go \n               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods \n               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the \n               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         Pleasant, yes?

The Magistrate \n               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.\n\n               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         Very well then. Rack him.\n\n               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, \n               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by \n               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet \n               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and \n               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.\n\n<b>                                     MAGISTRATE\n</b>                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man \n                         remains conscious through such pain. \n                         Enough?\n\n               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, \n               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we \n               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, \n               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; \n               Wallace wants to say something.\n\n<b>                                     WALLACE\n</b>                         That... will... clear your sinuses.\n\n               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears.\n\n               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift \n               the terrible instruments of dissection.\n\n               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE \n               as the disembowelment begins.

Longshanks \n               and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the \n               wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert \n               the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as \n               if he has heard...\n\n<b>               IN THE LONDON SQUARE\n</b>\n               the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English \n               strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives \n               a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his \n               head on the block.
