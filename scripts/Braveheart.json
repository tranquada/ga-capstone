MACANDREWS FARM - DAY\n\n               A farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley. \n               Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are \n               Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans, \n               sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet. \n               Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy.\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         Historians from England will say I \n                         am a liar. But history is written by \n                         those who have hung heroes.\n\n               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear \n               down the road, converging on the barn.\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         The King of Scotland had died without \n                         a son, and the king of England, a \n                         cruel pagan known as Edward the \n                         Longshanks, claimed the throne for \n                         himself.

So Longshanks invited them to \n                         talks of truce. No weapons, one page \n                         only.\n\n               The nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds.\n\n               They enter the barn, with their pages...\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY\n\n               Nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and \n               barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM \n               WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong, \n               tough men, are riding away from the farm.

THE BARN\n\n               POV from within as the door opens and a widening block of \n               sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John \n               Wallace step in, and are shocked to see...\n\n               POV THE WALLACES\n\n               Hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish \n               noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted \n               by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding.\n\n               Malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; \n               John still grips the axe as he follows his father through \n               the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see \n               the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         MacAndrews.\n\n               A SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door.\n\n                                     JOHN\n                         William!

It's too solid; \n               he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly --\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!...\n\n               He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged \n               man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, \n               and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men \n               begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and \n               older brother to fight their way to him.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         William! William!\n\n               Then, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself, \n               hanged in a row behind their masters!\n\n               Finally his father and brother reach William and hug him \n               tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the \n               hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons.\n\n                                     FATHER\n                         Murderin' English bastards.\n\n                                                                    CUT TO:\n\n               EXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               The cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into \n               the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close \n               the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN \n               UP to the upper bedroom window...\n\n               INSIDE THAT BEDROOM\n\n               Young William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered \n               terror; he twitches. We see\n\n               HIS NIGHTMARE\n\n               In the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door \n               of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights. We WHIP PAN to \n               their faces, garish, horrible... Then one of the heads moves \n               and its eyes open! William wants to run, but he can't get \n               his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated \n               tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...\n\n                                     GHOUL\n                         Will--iam...!\n\n               WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing \n               back his tears and panic.\n\n               IN THE KITCHEN\n\n               A dozen strong, tough farmers have huddled. Red-headed \n               CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while \n               his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Wallace is right!

To show 'em we're not dogs, but \n                         men.\n\n               Young Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the \n               stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of \n               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop.\n\n                                     MALCOLM WALLACE\n                         They have a camp here.

WALLACE FARM - DAY\n\n               Malcolm and John have saddled horses; they are checking the \n               short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William \n               comes out of the barn with his own horse.\n\n                                     MALCOLM\n                         William, you're staying here.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I can fight.\n\n               These words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and \n               kneel, to look into William's eyes.\n\n                                     MALCOLM\n                         Aye. But it's our wits that make us \n                         men. I love ya, boy. You stay.\n\n               Malcolm and John mount their horses and ride away, leaving \n               William looking forlorn. They wave; he waves back.\n\n               EXT SCOTTISH HILLS, NEAR THE WALLACE FARM - DAY\n\n               It's strangely quiet, until William and his friend HAMISH \n               CAMPBELL, a red-headed like his father, race up the hillside \n               and duck in among a grove of trees. Breathless, gasping, \n               they press their backs to the tree bark. William peers around \n               a tree, then shrinks back and whispers...\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         They're coming!\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         How many?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Three, maybe more!\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Armed?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         They're English soldiers, ain't they?\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         With your father and brother gone, \n                         they'll kill us and burn the farm!\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         It's up to us, Hamish!\n\n               Hamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Not yet! Here he comes, be ready!\n\n               They wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the \n               grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling \n               rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter \n               as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes \n               down on their play.\n\n               EXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN\n\n               The boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Wanna stay with me tonight?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I wanna have supper waitin'.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Aye, we'll get 'em.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               William's face appears at the window, looking toward\n\n               THE DISTANT HILLS\n\n               of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life.\n\n               INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two \n               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he \n               is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still \n               all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside \n               the stew, and moves up the stairs.\n\n               EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN\n\n               The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn.\n\n               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN\n\n               William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, \n               and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops \n               at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed \n               bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, \n               also unrumpled.\n\n               IN THE KITCHEN\n\n               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted \n               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\n               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the \n               hogs, while he glimpses something coming.\n\n               THE BOY'S POV\n\n               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is \n               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers \n               glance up at William, their faces grim...\n\n               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors \n               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart \n               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where \n               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the \n               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt \n               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         William... Come down here, lad.\n\n               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... \n               but the bodies are still there.\n\n               EXT. HOUSE - DAY\n\n               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The \n               undertaker arrives in his hearse.\n\n               INT. THE SHED - DAY\n\n               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is \n               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the \n               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.\n\n               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and \n               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but \n               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.\n\n               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to \n               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.\n\n               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the \n               blood. But the wounds remain.\n\n               EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY\n\n               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We \n               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see \n               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, \n               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as \n               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes \n               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.\n\n               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.\n\n               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's \n               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but \n               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.\n\n               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his \n               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a \n               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her \n               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of \n               death and might suck her parents in too.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.\n\n               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, \n               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment \n               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.\n\n               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so \n               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its \n               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a \n               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a \n               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and \n               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.\n\n               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue \n               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.\n\n               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill \n               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, \n               he looks like the grim reaper.\n\n               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches \n               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE \n               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, \n               permanently furious.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         You must be the relative of the \n                         deceased... William, this is your \n                         Uncle Argyle.\n\n               Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William.\n\n               William stares up at this frightening figure. They are \n               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a \n               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are \n               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         You were wise to hurry.\n\n               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down \n               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque.\n\n                                     LEADER\n                         Someone dead from this household?\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         We just had a funeral, isn't that \n                         what it means in England as well?\n\n                                     LEADER\n                         What it means in England -- and in \n                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have \n                         forfeited their lands. We were \n                         ambushed last night. But the Scots \n                         dragged their dead away.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         My brother and nephew perished two \n                         days ago, when their hay cart turned \n                         over.\n\n                                     LEADER\n                         Then we'll just have a peek at the \n                         wounds.\n                              (to his men)\n                         Dig 'em up!\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         They've been sanctified and buried \n                         in the holy rites of God's church, \n                         and any hand that disturbs them now \n                         takes on eternal damnation. So please -- \n                         do it.\n\n               Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of \n               the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Funeral's over. Go home.\n\n               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle \n               has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Not that spoon, that one's for soup. \n                         Dip away from you. And don't slurp.\n\n               Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         We'll sleep here tonight. You'll \n                         come home with me. We'll let the \n                         house, and the lands too; plenty of \n                         willing neighbors.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I don't want to leave.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Didn't want your father to die either, \n                         did ya? But it happened.\n\n               Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Did the priest say anything about \n                         the Resurrection? Or was it all about \n                         Judgment?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         It was in Latin, sir.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak \n                         Latin? We have to fix that, won't \n                         we?\n                              (beat)\n                         Did he give the poetic benediction? \n                         The Lord bless thee and keep thee? \n                         Patris Benefactum et --\n                              (beat)\n                         ...It was Malcolm's favorite.\n\n               INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n               Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands \n               awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand \n               and crawls into bed.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Good night, Uncle.\n\n               Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, \n               leans down over William... and with great tenderness the \n               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair.\n\n               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n               Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds \n               the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks \n               at the handle, like a cross. He whispers...\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         \"The Lord bless thee and keep thee...\"\n\n               Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks.\n\n               INT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM\n\n               Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking \n               at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled \n               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William \n               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his \n               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they \n               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches \n               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding \n               hand.\n\n               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother \n               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are \n               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads \n               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.\n\n               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and\n\n               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM\n\n               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still \n               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle.\n\n               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be \n               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- \n               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to\n\n               THE KITCHEN\n\n               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a \n               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He \n               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the \n               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a \n               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out \n               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind.\n\n               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound \n               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the \n               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he \n               realizes this, then forces himself on.\n\n               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT\n\n               William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are \n               buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the \n               farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- \n               and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient \n               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody \n               known to us as \"Amazing Grace.\" Uncle Argyle has heard them \n               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the \n               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances \n               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William \n               whispers...\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         What are they doing?\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- \n                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed \n                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes.\n\n               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each \n               whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to \n               William, and half to himself...\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Your Daddy and I, we saw our own \n                         father buried like this, dead from \n                         fighting the English.\n\n               William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift \n               it.\n\n               Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         First learn to use this.\n\n               He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger.\n\n                                     ARGYLE\n                         Then I will teach you to use this.\n\n               With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It \n               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging \n               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising \n               towards the stars...\n\n               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY\n\n               William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has \n               a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as \n               if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does \n               glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY\n\n               Amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with \n               gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear...\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         Twelve years later, Longshanks \n                         supervised the wedding of his eldest \n                         son, also named Edward, who would \n                         succeed him to the throne.\n\n               LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of \n               the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly \n               legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's \n               nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct \n               cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line \n               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had \n                         chosen a relative of his rival, the \n                         king of France.\n\n               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty \n               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her \n               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her \n               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control.\n\n               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men \n               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and \n               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         It was widely whispered that for the \n                         Princess to conceive, Longshanks \n                         would have to do the honors himself. \n                         That may have been what he had in \n                         mind all along.\n\n               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's \n               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince \n               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted \n               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new \n               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes \n               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.\n\n                                     VOICE OVER\n                         Having seen to his obligations to \n                         provide for a successor, Longshanks \n                         set about his fondest business -- to \n                         crush Scotland, and turn his power \n                         against France...\n\n               CLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES\n\n               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         Scotland!

PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY\n\n               The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped \n               to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the\n\n               KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- \n               they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; \n               it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, \n               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         What is it?!\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         You directed me to report to you the \n                         moment the king's conference was \n                         ended.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         So I did!

He intends --\n\n               But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of \n               their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         He intends to grant --\n\n               Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Shut up, would you!

He wants me to \n                         learn to fight too, so let me do it!\n\n               For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at \n               Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes \n               and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Stop there.\n\n               She stops, but does not raise her eyes.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Do you disapprove of Phillip?\n\n               He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side.\n\n               Still the Princess does not lift her eyes.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                              (barely audible)\n                         No, M'lord.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Look at me.

But she could not brace herself enough \n               for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's \n               bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men \n               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.\n\n               The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Now, my flower, do you understand?\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Yes.

SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY\n\n               Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families \n               have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy \n               bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of \n               cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of \n               smoked fish.\n\n               And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, \n               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.\n\n               Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a \n               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, \n               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled \n               power. He looks dangerous.\n\n               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.\n\n               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he \n               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the \n               scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing \n               handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the \n               traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing \n               William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters \n               of marriageable age.\n\n               Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older \n               now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William \n               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English \n               SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         Hey boy! You hunt this bird?\n\n               William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         It's against the law for Scots to \n                         own bows. You shot this bird?\n\n               His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the \n               bird and begin to search it for evidence.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I hit it in the head. With a rock.\n\n               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture \n               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return \n               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.\n\n               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.\n\n               The farmers watch him come.\n\n               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not \n               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young \n               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long \n               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her \n               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a \n               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, \n               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William \n               notice her too.\n\n               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to \n               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.\n\n                                     FARM WOMAN\n                         ...William? It's William Wallace, \n                         back home! -- Have you met my \n                         daughter?\n\n               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to \n               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright \n               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But \n               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand \n               and gives her a respectful bow.\n\n               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like \n               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He \n               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember \n               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes \n               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.\n\n               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about \n               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth \n               at Williams' feet.\n\n               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, \n               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's \n               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle \n               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him \n               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Hamish?\n\n               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put \n               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Test of manhood.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         You win.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                              (blocks him)\n                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. \n                         The English won't let us train with \n                         weapons, so we train with stones.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         The test of a soldier is not in his \n                         arm. It's here.\n\n               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to \n               show William something in his palm.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         No. It's here.\n\n               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's \n               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, \n               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders \n               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands \n               over William, waiting for him to get up.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         A contest, then.\n\n               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in \n               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to \n               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are \n               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run \n               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the \n               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I still say this is no test. A \n                         catapult can throw a stone farther \n                         than a man can.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         That depends on the man.\n\n               Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the \n               line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone \n               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.\n\n               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Can you do it when it matters? As it \n                         matters in battle? Could you crush a \n                         man with that throw?\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         I could crush you like a roach.\n\n               William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Then do it. Come, do it.\n\n               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts \n               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands \n               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         You'll move\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I will not.\n\n               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.\n\n                                     FARMER STEWART\n                         That's not fair!\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         He's tired, he should get a longer \n                         run.\n\n               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a \n               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.\n\n               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and \n               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's \n               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. \n               William never flinches. The people cheer.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Brave show!\n\n               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         I threw longer than last time!\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         An ox is strong, but not clever.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand \n                         in one place.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         That's not the point.\n\n               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and \n               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the \n               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         That is.\n\n               Everybody cheers and laughs! They surround William.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         A fine display, young Wallace!\n\n               William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and \n               tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, \n               his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Good to see you again.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         I should'a remembered the eggs.\n\n               Grinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins.\n\n               William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes \n               Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Would you honor me with a dance?\n\n               She's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.\n\n                                     GIRL\n                         You've taken over your father's farm?\n                              (beat)\n                         They say he died long ago. Fighting \n                         the English.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         He died in an accident, with my \n                         brother. Their cart turned over.\n\n               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily \n               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, \n               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In \n               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, \n               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.\n\n                                     NOBLEMAN\n                         I have come to claim the right of \n                         prima noctes. As the lord of these \n                         lands, I will bless this marriage by \n                         taking the bride into my bed on the \n                         first night of her union.\n\n               Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward.\n\n                                     STEWART\n                         No, by God!\n\n               The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who \n               see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to \n               the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.\n\n                                     NOBLEMAN\n                         It is my noble right.\n\n               Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride \n               intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She \n               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, \n               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. \n               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's \n               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more \n               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a \n               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is \n               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.\n\n               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins \n               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the \n               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, \n               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.\n\n               EXT. THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               The farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at \n               the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, \n               through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.\n\n               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               A thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain.\n\n               A hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find \n               William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Good evening, sir. May I speak with \n                         your daughter?\n\n               Mrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion \n               appears behind her scowling parents.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Marion... Would you like to go for a \n                         ride on this fine evening?\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         The boy's insane!\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         It's good Scottish weather, Madam, \n                         the rain is fallin' straight down.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         She absolutely may not, she'll -- \n                         Marion!\n\n               Marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she \n               runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away.\n\n               THE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR\n\n               William and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, \n               through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; \n               the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty.\n\n               William stops the horse and they look out over it all \n               together. He speaks, without turning to face her.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Your father doesn't like me, does \n                         he?\n\n                                     MARION\n                         It's not you. He dislikes that you're \n                         a Wallace. He just says... the \n                         Wallaces don't seem to live for very \n                         long.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Thank you for accepting.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Thank you for inviting.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I'll invite you again, but your mother \n                         thinks I'm crazy.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         You are. And I'll come again.\n\n               He lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just \n               doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse.\n\n               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               They reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches \n               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they \n               look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open \n               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Marion, come in!\n\n               He walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each \n               other again. She waits for him to kiss her...\n\n                                     MOTHER\n                         Marion, come in!\n\n               She still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. She starts \n               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he \n               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops \n               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away.\n\n               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he \n               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, \n               the one she gave him years before.\n\n               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY\n\n               William is re-thatching the roof of his barn, when he hears \n               riders approaching, and looks down to see that it is \n               MacClannough, backed by Campbell and Hamish. Uh-oh.\n\n                                     MACCLANNOUGH\n                         Young Wallace --\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Sir, I know it was strange of me to \n                         invite Marion to ride last night. I \n                         assure you, I --\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         MacClannough's daughter is another \n                         matter. We come to fetch you to a \n                         meeting.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         What kind of meeting?\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         The secret kind.\n\n               William goes back to repairing his roof.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Your father was a fighter. And a \n                         patriot.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I know who my father was. I came \n                         back home to raise crops. And, God \n                         willing, a family. If I can live in \n                         peace, I will.\n\n               Campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away, with \n               Hamish. MacClannough lingers.\n\n                                     MACCLANNOUGH\n                         If you can keep your intention to \n                         stay out of the troubles, you may \n                         court my daughter. If you break your \n                         intention, I'll kill you.\n\n               MacClannough rides away. William sits down on the roof, and \n               looks out at the graves of his father and brother.\n\n               EXT. MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Outside the half-timbered house, William stands in the shadows \n               of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper \n               window. Marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the \n               vines, dropping into William's arms.\n\n               Giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees...\n\n               SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - NIGHT\n\n               Hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along \n               a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, \n               the Scottish wind whipping through their hair.\n\n               They stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking \n               a loch gleaming in the moonlight. So beautiful it's sacred.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         You've been here before?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly \n                         dreams I don't want. I started riding \n                         at night to fill up my mind so that \n                         when I did sleep I'd dream only of \n                         the ride and the adventure.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Did it work?\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         No. You don't choose your dreams. \n                         Your dreams choose you.\n\n               He looks at her. They kiss suddenly, so long and hard that \n               they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other.\n\n               Through their passion...\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I want... to marry you!\n\n                                     MARION\n                         I... accept your proposal!\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I'm not just saying it!\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Nor I!\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         But I won't give you up to any \n                         nobleman.\n\n                                     MARION\n                              (stopping)\n                         You scare me.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I don't want to scare you. I want to \n                         be yours, and you mine. Every night \n                         like this one.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         This night is too beautiful to have \n                         again.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I will be with you, like this. \n                         Forever.\n\n               They kiss again...\n\n               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY\n\n               Marion moves through the market. English soldiers admire her \n               as she walks. She stops, looking at white lace and cloth.\n\n               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly \n               she withdraws his note, and reads:\n\n               INSERT - HIS NOTE\n\n               Tonight. By the trees.\n\n               EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Marion slips out of the house and runs to the trees, where \n               William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed \n               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off.\n\n               EXT. RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH - NIGHT\n\n               The church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch.\n\n               INT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT\n\n               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by \n               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, \n               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The \n               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is \n               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as \n               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.\n\n               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she \n               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches \n               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this \n               moment.\n\n               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         You have come to pledge, each to the \n                         other, before Almighty God.\n\n               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth \n               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand \n               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I will love you my whole life. You \n                         and no other.\n\n               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered \n               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those \n               years ago.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.\n\n               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're \n               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest \n               intones holy phrases...\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless \n                         and keep thy love, now and forever.\n\n               The lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure \n               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door \n               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the \n               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.\n\n                                     PRIEST\n                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him \n                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.\n\n               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive \n               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into \n               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges \n               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE\n\n               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, \n               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their \n               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their \n               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn.\n\n               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY\n\n               It's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, \n               merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like \n               jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table \n               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging \n               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his \n               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks \n               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she \n               remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I've missed you.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Shush. It's only been a day.\n                              (beat)\n                         And it's seemed like forever.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Tonight then.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         My parents are growing suspicious! I \n                         can't keep meeting you every night!\n\n               Playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, \n               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their \n               wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Then when?\n\n                                     MARION\n                         ...Tonight!\n\n               Tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling.\n\n               ANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY\n\n               They spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful.\n\n               The soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of \n               them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the \n               one who's been staring at her.\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         Where are you going... lass?\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Let go.\n\n               A second drunken SOLDIER pipes up.\n\n                                     SOLDIER #2\n                         Why don't you marry my friend here? \n                         Then I'll take the first night!\n\n               The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves \n               him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to \n               the laughter of his friends. Then he snatches her again and \n               kisses her hard on the lips.\n\n               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw \n               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her \n               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over \n               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale \n               public gang rape. As the townspeople try to move in the three \n               soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, \n               keep them townspeople back.\n\n                                     SOLDIER #1\n                         Bitch, who do you think you are?\n\n               He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, \n               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and \n               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!\n\n               It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what \n               just happened, and in that instant William is on them. He \n               wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant \n               to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and \n               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.\n\n               Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short \n               swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their \n               knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting \n               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         William!\n\n               She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now \n               bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William \n               with a knife. William sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a \n               leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.\n\n                                     MARKET WOMEN\n                         Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!\n\n               But there's no time for celebration. There's blood and ale \n               everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling...\n\n                                     FALLEN SOLDIER\n                         Rebels! Help!\n\n               MORE SOLDIERS hear the call and come running, reinforcements \n               converging from all over the village.\n\n                                     VILLAGE FOLKS\n                         Run, William! Run!\n\n               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws \n               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it \n               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William \n               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of \n               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!\n\n               William pauses out in the central street of the village, \n               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts \n               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; \n               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval \n               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.\n\n               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down \n               at his mangled soldiers. The one with the ruptured arm is \n               lying in agony.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         What happened?\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         ...girl.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         What girl?!\n\n                                     SOLDIER\n                         ...on horse.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         The girl on the horse! Stop her!\n\n               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and \n               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's \n               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even \n               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...\n\n               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there \n               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden \n               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.\n\n               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught \n               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward \n               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching \n               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.\n\n               WILLIAM\n\n               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the \n               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've \n               lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper \n               into the trees.\n\n               IN THE TOWN, MARION\n\n               recovers; her dress has torn free! She starts to get up; but \n               the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         So this is the little whore he was \n                         fighting for.\n\n               EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY\n\n               William moves into the shelters of the trees, expecting to \n               see Marion. He doesn't. He listens; only the rustling of the \n               wind through the treetops.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Marion!\n\n               Nothing, except the wind.\n\n               INT. ROYAL MAGISTRATE'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY\n\n               Marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an \n               oak staff behind her elbows. She and two dozen soldiers are \n               in the tavern the English have commandeered.\n\n               The Magistrate is a battlescarred veteran, a brutal pragmatist \n               angry with his CORPORAL.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to \n                         pay when that gets round.\n\n                                     CORPORAL\n                         Burn the village.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         But he is free. You never catch 'em \n                         in the Highlands.\n\n               He studies Marion, her mouth now stuffed with burlap. He \n               notices the strip of cloth around her neck, and touches the \n               weave curiously.\n\n                                     CORPORAL\n                         Clans weave that cloth in their own \n                         patterns.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         So why is this strip concealed?\n                              (beat)\n                         He fought for you, eh?\n\n               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY\n\n               The Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village \n               center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople \n               don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the \n               fringes of the square, too curious to pull away.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         An assault on the king's soldiers is \n                         the same as assaulting the king!\n\n               He looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant.\n\n               He jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat!\n\n               Her eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The \n               townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are \n               shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Now. Let this scrapper come to me.\n\n               LONG SHOT - EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY\n\n               From a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the \n               same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves \n               reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, \n               William appears, hurrying out to him.\n\n               We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously \n               for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells \n               him something that makes William step backwards...\n\n               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY\n\n               At a barrier across the main road into the center of the \n               village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully \n               armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT...\n\n               THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE\n\n               He has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is \n               something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the \n               twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery.\n\n               Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!\n\n               EXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT\n\n               We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse \n               pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their \n               eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their \n               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...\n\n               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch \n               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as \n               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's \n               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly \n               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the \n               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!\n\n               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his \n               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's \n               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a \n               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder \n               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two \n               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.\n\n               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV\n\n               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, \n               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; \n               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next \n               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the \n               broadsword, a man dies.\n\n               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from \n               the village, follow in his wake.\n\n               EXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY\n\n               The Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty \n               more of his men are barricaded around the village square.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Don't look surprised! We knew he'd \n                         bring friends!\n\n               The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads \n               down a side street.\n\n               The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?\n\n               Which way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, \n               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The \n               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.\n\n               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on \n               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!\n\n               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.\n\n               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues.\n\n               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters.\n\n               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         No! I beg you... mercy!\n\n               IN THE TOWN SQUARE\n\n               As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English \n               soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his \n               hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams \n               him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs \n               and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Please. Mercy!\n\n               Wallace's eyes shift, falling on\n\n               THE STAIN OF BLOOD\n\n               Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, \n               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. Wallace \n               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat \n               with the sword.\n\n               ON THE OTHER SCOTS\n\n               Silenced by what they've just seen and done. On old Campbell's \n               face is a look of reverence, and awe.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Say Grace to God, lads. We've just \n                         seen the coming of the Messiah.\n\n               William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees.\n\n               And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople \n               too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant.\n\n                                     CROWD\n                         AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!\n\n               William's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. And there in \n               the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he \n               gave to Marion, now stained with her blood. He lifts it, \n               crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war.\n\n               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT\n\n               The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at \n               the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound...\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Pour it straight into the wound. I \n                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey, \n                         but indulge me.\n\n               They obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run \n               it through Campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. There \n               is a terrible SIZZLE, and Campbell reacts to the pain.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, \n                         lads.\n\n               Campbell looks down at his left hand. His thumb is missing!\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now \n                         it's nothing but a fly swatter.\n\n               Wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. Hamish \n               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. Wallace looks at \n               his friend, and looks away; killing the Magistrate did not \n               bring Marion back.\n\n               SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming! The farmers scramble \n               for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; \n               but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more \n               farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could \n               find for weapons. Their leader is MacGREGOR.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         MacGregor -- from the next valley!\n\n               MacGregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.\n\n                                     MACGREGOR\n                         We heard about what was happenin'. \n                         And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can \n                         have your fun without us.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Go home. Some of us are in this, I \n                         can't help that now. But you can \n                         help yourselves. Go home.\n\n                                     MACGREGOR\n                         We'll have no homes left when the \n                         English garrison at the castle comes \n                         through to burn us out.\n\n               They all look at Wallace.\n\n               EXT. ENGLISH MILITARY STRONGHOLD - NIGHT\n\n               Furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone \n               spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. The garrison is \n               led by BOTTOMS, the English lord who claimed the right of \n               prima noctes. Now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.\n\n                                     LORD BOTTOMS\n                         Gather the horses! Align the infantry!\n                              (grabs a man)\n                         Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling.\n\n               Tell him that I will hang five rebels for every good \n               Englishman killed! FORM FOR MARCH!\n\n               The troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. At the same \n               time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the \n               keepers to open it. They pull up the chains and the heavy \n               gate rises. The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- \n               and is hit in the chest with an axe!\n\n               The Scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, \n               led by Wallace! Arrows pick soldiers from their perches, \n               Scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that \n               it's over almost without a fight. Lord Bottoms looks around \n               in confusion...\n\n                                     LORD BOTTOMS\n                         Stop them... Don't let... Align...\n\n               Scots drag Lord Bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed \n               bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the \n               shaft through Bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but \n               Wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers -- and Bottoms \n               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is \n               none other than the Highland farmgirl he forced into his bed \n               on her wedding night.

Edgy, they perk up at the sound of \n               muffled hoofbeats -- then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure -- \n               Wallace -- suddenly looms up behind them, galloping and \n               swirling fire! He hurls burning torches into the clustered \n               soldiers, setting some of them on fire!\n\n               MEANWHILE, HAMISH has crawled to Marion's grave and is digging \n               frantically. The new dirt parts easily and he pulls the \n               shrouded body out, cringing with the effort.\n\n               MORE SOLDIERS rush from behind the rocks at the far side of \n               the graveyard. Wallace charges them, driving them back. He \n               grabs the reins of Hamish's horse, hidden among trees, and \n               gallops to him.\n\n               Hamish hands the shrouded body up to William and bounds into \n               the saddle of his own horse.

And \n                         I brought you this tarta --\n\n               As he reaches into his cloak, both Hamish and Campbell \n               instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck.\n\n                                     SENTRY\n                         We checked them for arms.\n\n               Carefully, Faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and \n               replaces Wallace's tattered old one.\n\n                                     FAUDRON\n                         It's your family tartan! My wife \n                         wove it with her own hands.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Thank her for me.\n\n               A loud voice interrupts...\n\n                                     VOICE\n                         Him? That can't be William Wallace! \n                         I'm prettier than this man!\n\n               They all look at a slender, handsome young man, STEPHEN, who \n               is talking to himself -- or more accurately, seems to listen \n               to some unheard voice, then answer it...\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         All right, Father, I'll ask him!\n                              (to William)\n                         If I risk my neck for you, will I \n                         get a chance to kill Englishmen?\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you \n                         converse with God Almighty?\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         In order to find his equal, and \n                         Irishman is forced to talk to God.\n                              (quickly)\n                         Yes, Father!...\n                              (to Wallace)\n                         The Almighty says don't change the \n                         subject, just answer the fookin' \n                         question.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Insane Irish --\n\n               Stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at \n               Campbell's throat.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Smart enough to get a dagger past \n                         your guards, old man.\n\n               Wallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         That's my friend, Irishman. And the \n                         answer's yes. You fight for me, you \n                         kill the English.\n\n               Stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm \n                         the most wanted man on the Emerald \n                         Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald \n                         Isle of course, more's the pity.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         A common thief.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         A patriot!\n\n               Wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the \n               sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\n               A column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- \n               moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands.\n\n               English LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a \n               pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five \n               Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots \n               run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft.\n\n                                     SCOUT\n                         Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west!\n\n                                     DOLECROFT\n                         They've blundered at last! After \n                         them!\n\n               The English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed \n               direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and \n               ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English \n               horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the \n               English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see...\n\n                                     SCOUT\n                         We're in a bog!\n\n                                     DOLECROFT\n                         Here, it's firm this way --\n\n               But as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear \n               on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling.\n\n               Dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, \n               with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right \n               of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, \n               Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, \n               screams, and leads the charge...\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY\n\n               The Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with \n               the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, \n               clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's \n               plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy \n               sheathed broadsword across his shoulders.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Stop here and rest.\n\n               They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing \n               water from sheep belly canteens.\n\n               INT. STIRLING CASTLE - DAY\n\n               LORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the \n               disaster. He reads the message, and pales.\n\n                                     PICKERING\n                         Another ambush! My God! ...What about \n                         our infiltrator?\n\n                                     ASSISTANT\n                         He has already joined them, M'lord.\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT\n\n               The moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night.\n\n               Most everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against \n               a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a \n               shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty \n               feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and \n               then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, \n               cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Marion! Is... is it you?\n\n               Joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before \n               he touches her, as if she might evaporate.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I'm dreaming.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Yes, you are. And you must wake.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I don't want to wake. I want to stay \n                         with you.\n\n                                     MARION\n                         And I with you. But you must wake.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I need you so much! I love you!\n\n                                     MARION\n                         Wake up, William. Wake up!\n\n                                     HAMISH'S VOICE\n                         Wake up, William!...\n\n                                     MARION/HAMISH\n                         Wake up!...\n\n               William clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her.\n\n               HE WAKES\n\n               lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, \n               William's arms clutched empty to his chest.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         William! Hounds!\n\n               Wallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed \n               Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         We must run in different directions!\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         We don't split up!\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         They used hounds on us in Ireland, \n                         it's the only way!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide \n                         them and run!\n\n               Shoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then \n               takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the \n               woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. \n               The BARKS are getting closer.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Split again!\n\n               Again they divide, and race in different directions.\n\n               But no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer.\n\n               We INTERCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK \n               OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the \n               dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long \n               chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches.\n\n               Wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a \n               new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is \n               down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         No matter how we go, they follow. \n                         They have our scent. My scent.\n\n                                     FAUDRON\n                         Run! You must not be caught!\n\n               Faster now, faster. The barks are getting very close.\n\n               Wallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood \n               beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we \n               MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         We can't stop!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         They've tricked us.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         What's the crazy man saying, Lord?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         The dogs have a scent. My scent. \n                         Someone must have given it to them.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Who would do such a thing?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Exactly.\n\n               Wallace pulls out his dagger...\n\n               THE DOGS\n\n               bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at \n               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.\n\n                                     HANDLER\n                         Be ready! We have them!\n\n               The soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their \n               prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs \n               find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their \n               snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight \n               furiously to tear the dogs from the body.\n\n               Lord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is \n               Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the \n               scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked \n               into his shirt.\n\n                                     LORD PICKERING\n                         Damnation! Damnation!\n\n               As Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around.\n\n                                     LORD PICKERING\n                         After him! Get them going again!\n\n                                     HANDLER\n                         Their noses are drowned in new blood, \n                         they'll follow nothing now!\n\n               And just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't \n               pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among \n               his men leans in from behind him to whisper...\n\n                                     STEPHEN OF IRELAND\n                         The Almighty says for you to give \n                         His regards to the Devil.\n\n               Pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger \n               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As \n               Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen \n               has already run back into the trees.\n\n               Pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even \n               the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around \n               them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus \n               of demonic, bloodcurdling yells --\n\n                                     WALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN\n                         ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!\n\n               Three wild men tear out of the darkness from different \n               directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and \n               run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by \n               their torches, fell with them in all directions.\n\n               Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of \n               the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- \n               and then laughing like hyenas!\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         I thought I was dead when ya pulled \n                         that dagger!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         No English lord would trust an \n                         Irishman!\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Let's kill him anyway.\n\n               They laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he \n               stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream.\n\n               VARIOUS SHOTS - THE STORY SPREADS THROUGH SCOTLAND...\n\n               Two men are talking in A VILLAGE...\n\n                                     VILLAGER\n                         ...and William Wallace killed fifty \n                         men!

SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY\n\n               A Highlander, a RUNNER, slips like a shadow up the hillside, \n               to a circle of ancient monoliths. There, hidden among the \n               stone pillars, he finds Wallace and his band resting.\n\n                                     RUNNER\n                         The English are advancing an army \n                         toward Stirling!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Do the nobles rally?\n\n                                     RUNNER\n                         Robert the Bruce and most of the \n                         others will not commit to war! But \n                         word has spread and Highlanders are \n                         coming down on their own, by the \n                         hundreds -- by the thousands!\n\n               EXT. ROAD - DAY\n\n               Wallace rides down the road, followed by his band. As they \n               pass people on the road, the women, the children, all cheer.\n\n                                     PEOPLE\n                         Wallace! It's William Wallace! God \n                         bless Wallace and Scotland!\n\n               At a crossroads, more of Wallace's men join them, in clusters. \n               One group carries something long, encased in wool covers. \n               Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave \n               their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after \n               the riders. They put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their \n               wives and head off to fight.\n\n               EXT. STIRLING FIELD - DAY\n\n               Stirling Castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, \n               cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge.\n\n               SCOTTISH NOBLES have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking \n               the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and \n               banners, and are attended by squires and grooms.\n\n               The mists of morning shroud most of the field. But from the \n               opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a \n               huge army moving forward. LOCHLAN, a noble, gallops to Mornay.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         It sounds like twenty thousand!\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         The scouts say it is ten.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         And we have but two!\n\n               THE COMMON SCOTTISH SOLDIERS\n\n               are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and \n               daggers. As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed \n               against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN.\n\n                                     YOUNG SOLDIER\n                         So many!\n\n                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN\n                         The nobles will negotiate. If they \n                         deal, they send us home. If not, we \n                         charge. When we are all dead and \n                         they can call themselves brave, they \n                         withdraw.\n\n                                     YOUNG SOLDIER\n                         I didn't come to fight so they could \n                         own more lands that I could work for \n                         them!\n\n                                     VETERAN\n                         Nor did I. Not against these odds!\n\n               He lowers his pike and starts to desert. At first one-by-one \n               and then in clumps, more highlanders follow.\n\n               THE NOBLES see the desertion.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now! \n                         Wait until we have negotiated!\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         They won't stop -- and who could \n                         blame them?\n\n               Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by \n               his friends. He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms \n               bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather \n               shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, \n               Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it.\n\n               The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace \n               and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. The \n               soldiers whisper among themselves...\n\n                                     YOUNG SOLDIER\n                         William Wallace?\n\n                                     VETERAN\n                         Couldn't be.\n\n               The common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up \n               the hill to see the confrontation. As Wallace and his captains \n               reach the nobles, Stephen laughs.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         The Almighty says this must be a \n                         fashionable fight, it's drawn the \n                         finest people.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         Where is thy salute?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         For presenting yourselves on this \n                         battlefield, I give you thanks.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         This is our army. To join it, you \n                         give homage.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I give homage to Scotland. And if \n                         this is your army, why does it go?\n\n               Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen \n               men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, \n               Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing \n               that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.\n\n               He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen.\n\n               They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.\n\n                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN\n                         We didn't come to fight for them!\n\n                                     SHOUTS FROM MOB\n                         Home! The English are too many!\n\n               Wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Sons of Scotland!...

Wal-lace! WAL-LACE!\n\n               BAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But \n               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy \n               army. Hamish, Campbell and Stephen move up beside William.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Fine speech. Now what do we do?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Bring out our spearmen and set them \n                         in the field.\n\n               Campbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse \n               over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them \n               to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.\n\n               Wallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to \n               meet the English contingent.\n\n               OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS\n\n               meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. \n               CHELTHAM, head of the English contingent, glares at Wallace.\n\n                                     CHELTHAM\n                         Mornay.

Absolutely. Here are \n                         Scotland's terms. Lower your flags \n                         and march straight to England, \n                         stopping at every Scottish home you \n                         pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred \n                         years of theft, rape, and murder. Do \n                         that, and your men shall live. Do it \n                         not, and every one of you will die \n                         today.\n\n               Cheltham barks at the Scottish nobles...\n\n                                     CHELTHAM\n                         You are outmatched! You haven't even \n                         any cavalry! In two centuries no \n                         army has won without it!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I'm not finished. Before we let you \n                         leave, your commander must cross \n                         that bridge, stand before this army, \n                         put his head between his legs, and \n                         kiss his own ass.\n\n               The outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines.\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         I'd say that was rather less cordial \n                         that he was used to.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Be ready, and do exactly as I say.\n\n               They return to the Scottish lines. Wallace dismounts where \n               his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears. Hamish, eyebrows \n               raised, looks expectantly at Wallace; Wallace nods.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Wish I could see the noble lord's \n                         face when he tells him.\n\n               LORD TALMADGE, AT HIS COMMAND POST\n\n               The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's \n               report. Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN \n               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. Suddenly \n               the Scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the English!\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give \n                         no quarter! And I want this Wallace's \n                         heart brought to me on a plate!\n\n               Cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...\n\n               EXT. THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY\n\n               The English army moves forward toward the bridge. It's so \n               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it \n               at any one time. The English heavy cavalry, two hundred \n               knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.\n\n               WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS\n\n               Things look terrible. Stephen turns to William.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         The Lord tell me He can get me out \n                         of this mess. But He's pretty sure \n                         you're fooked.\n\n               ON THE ENGLISH SIDE\n\n               Talmadge sees the Scots doing nothing.\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         Amateurs! They do not even contest \n                         us! Send across the infantry.\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                         M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         The Scots just stand in their \n                         formations!\n\n               Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Get the infantry \n               across so they can finish the slaughter!\n\n               The English leaders shout orders and keep their men moving \n               across the bridge. Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.\n\n               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE\n\n               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to \n               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower \n               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they \n               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in \n               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!\n\n               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground \n               literally shakes with the charge.\n\n               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to \n               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH \n               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the \n               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...\n\n               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Steady! Hold... hold... NOW!\n\n               The Scots snap their 14-foot spears straight up in unison.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         FORM!\n\n               Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first \n               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above \n               the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five \n               foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.\n\n               The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their \n               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum \n               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on \n               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale \n               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.\n\n               TALMADGE\n\n               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN \n               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.\n\n               WALLACE AND HIS MEN\n\n               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and \n               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen \n               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still \n               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull \n               up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile \n               than the knights; the field runs with blood.\n\n               Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Here I am, English coward! Come get \n                         me!!\n\n               TALMADGE is even more enraged -- and his judgment is gone.\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         Press the men across!\n\n                                     CHELTHAM\n                         But M'lord!\n\n               Talmadge himself gallops forward.\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         PRESS THEM!\n\n               WALLACE smiles. He grabs Hamish.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and \n                         cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be \n                         sure the English see him ride away!\n\n               Hamish hurries off with the message.\n\n               The English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge.\n\n               The Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback.\n\n               They have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored.\n\n                                     LOCHLAN\n                         If he waits much longer --\n\n               Hamish hurries up.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Ride around and ford behind them!\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         We should not divide our forces!\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Wallace says do it! And he says for \n                         you to let the English see you!\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                              (understanding)\n                         They shall think we run away.\n\n               Mornay leads his riders away.\n\n               LORD TALMADGE\n\n               sees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham...\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         See! Every Scot with a horse is \n                         fleeing! Hurry! Hurry!\n\n               He drives half his army across the river.\n\n               WALLACE\n\n               lifts his sword.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         For Scotland!\n\n               He charges down the hill...\n\n               THE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS\n\n               The Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English.\n\n               The English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         Press reinforcements across!\n\n               The English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers \n               onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the \n               other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam \n               into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall \n               back on each other, further blocking the bridge.\n\n               UP ON THE HILLTOP\n\n               The nobles look back with grudging admiration.\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         He's taking the bloody bridge! The \n                         English can't get across! He's evened \n                         the odds at one stroke!\n\n               With rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur...\n\n               DOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the \n               English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge \n               itself. The waters below it run red with blood.\n\n               Talmadge has begun to panic.\n\n                                     TALMADGE\n                         Use the archers!\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                         They're too close, we'll shoot out \n                         own men!\n\n               ON THE BRIDGE\n\n               the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; \n               nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he \n               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight \n               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old \n               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English \n               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but \n               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs \n               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin \n               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.\n\n               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a \n               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable \n               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; \n               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, \n               his hair, and his brain.\n\n               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining \n               English General tries to save the army.\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                         We are still five thousand! Rally!\n\n               The English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording \n               the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank \n               and ride over the surprised English infantry.\n\n               AT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE\n\n               sees the Scottish nobles attacking. The English soldiers are \n               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.\n\n               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not \n               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing \n               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow \n               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!\n\n               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies \n               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on \n               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.\n\n               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders \n               of his men.\n\n                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS\n                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!\n\n               INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY\n\n               William kneels before one of Scotland's ancient elders, who \n               lifts a silver sword and dubs William's shoulders.\n\n                                     ELDER\n                         I knight thee Sir William Wallace.\n\n               William rises and faces the Great Hall, crowded with hundreds \n               of new admirers, as well as his old friends in their new \n               clothes and armor. The crowd chants --\n\n                                     CROWD\n                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace!!\n\n               Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the \n               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained \n               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he \n               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment \n               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a \n               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in \n               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, \n               and fingers the cloth she gave him.\n\n               INT. SCOTTISH COUNCIL - DAY\n\n               The nobles of Scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a \n               massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned \n               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring \n               at each other. Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert \n               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the \n               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig...\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Does anyone know his politics?\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         No. But his weight with the commoners \n                         could unbalance everything. The \n                         Balliols will kiss his ass, so we \n                         must.\n\n               A court STEWARDS steps in and formally announces...\n\n                                     STEWARD\n                         Lords of Scotland: Sir William \n                         Wallace!\n\n               The nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other \n               in their acclamation as Wallace strides in, flanked by Hamish, \n               Campbell, and Stephen, splendid in their tartans.\n\n               Old Craig rises.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Sir William. In the name of God, we \n                         declare and appoint thee High \n                         Protector of Scotland! And thy \n                         captains as aides decamp!\n\n               The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape \n               a golden chain of office around his neck. Wallace takes the \n               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the \n               necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud.\n\n               Almost before the applause dies, a member of the BALLIOL \n               clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...\n\n                                     BALLIOL\n                         Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and \n                         your captains hail from a region \n                         long known to support the Balliol \n                         clan, may we invite you to join us?\n\n               But Wallace's gaze has locked onto Robert the Bruce, who \n               stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the \n               leadership power of each other.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         You are Robert the Bruce.\n\n                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE\n                         I am.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         My father fought in support of yours.\n\n               The Balliols shrivel. The nobles on the Bruce side can barely \n               keep from grinning. Suddenly the men on the other end of the \n               table change their attack.\n\n                                     BALLIOL\n                         With this new success, the result of \n                         all of Scotland's efforts, now is \n                         the time to declare a king!\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         Then you are prepared to recognize \n                         our legitimate succession!\n\n                                     BALLIOL\n                         You're the ones who won't support \n                         the true claim! I demand consideration \n                         of these documents!\n\n               Wallace glances again at the Bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed \n               of the bickering.\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         Those were lies when they were \n                         written! Our documents prove \n                         absolutely that --\n\n               Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Sir William!

One class -- \n                         free. One price -- courage.\n\n               He turns again and strides toward the door.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         But... what will you do?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I will invade England.

That's impossible, it --\n\n               Wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length \n               of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps \n               of the nobles.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         LISTEN TO ME!

And \n                         I go to make sure they have it.\n\n               Wallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his \n               friends file out behind him.\n\n               INT. EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Wallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce \n               runs out after them.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Wait! ...I respect what you said. \n                         But remember, these men have lands, \n                         castles.

Its \n                         nobles share allegiance with England \n                         and its clans war with each other. \n                         If you make enemies on both sides of \n                         the border, you'll end up dead.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         We all end up dead. It's only a \n                         question of how. And why.\n\n               Wallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an \n               urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         I'm no coward!

What does that mean -- to be \n                         noble? Your title gives you claim to \n                         the throne of our country. But men \n                         don't follow titles, they follow \n                         courage! Your arm speaks louder than \n                         your tongue. Our people know you. \n                         Noble and common, they respect you. \n                         If you would lead them toward freedom, \n                         they would follow you.

With the collision, THE BATTLE IS ON. It's a night \n               battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being \n               splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate.\n\n               The oil beats the first wave of Scots back, but Wallace rushes \n               forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the \n               attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and \n               again. It breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, \n               broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. Wallace grabs a torch, \n               throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts --\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Back!

We will \n                         be more merciful than they have been. \n                         We will spare women, children, and \n                         priests. For all else, no mercy.\n\n               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the \n               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace \n               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.\n\n               INT. THE PALACE IN LONDON - DAY\n\n               Prince Edward and Phillip, his fencing friend and lover, \n               hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard \n               below; they look out the window and see the arrival of \n               Longshanks.\n\n               They lean back into the room and Edward begins to pace \n               nervously.\n\n                                     PHILLIP\n                         It is not your fault! Stand up to \n                         him.\n\n               Edward shows Phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt \n               behind his back.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I will stand up to him, and more.\n\n               Longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. First \n               he glares at Phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his \n               piercing stare to his own son.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         What news of the north?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent \n                         riders to speed any word.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         While I am in France fighting to \n                         expand your future kingdom I learn \n                         that Stirling castle is lost, our \n                         entire northern army wiped out! And \n                         you have done nothing?!\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I have ordered conscriptions...\n\n               A messenger enters and hands the prince a message. Edward \n               reads it and nearly loses his balance.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Wallace has sacked York!\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         Impossible.\n                              (to messenger)\n                         How dare you bring a panicky lie.\n\n               The messenger has also brought a basket. He approaches the \n               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, \n               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks \n               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the \n               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his \n               nephew, York's (former) Governor.\n\n                                     PHILLIP\n                         Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast \n                         could do such a thing?!\n\n               The king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         If he can sack York, he can invade \n                         lower England.\n\n                                     PHILLIP\n                         We would stop him!\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         Edward, who is this shitpoker who \n                         speaks to me as if I needed his \n                         advice?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         I have declared Phillip my High \n                         Counselor.\n\n               Longshanks nods as if impressed. He moves to Phillip and \n               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.\n\n               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the \n               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories \n               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.\n\n               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at \n               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, \n               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.\n\n               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, \n               parrying, letting his arms be cut.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         You fight back at last!\n\n               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples \n               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the \n               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He \n               exhausts his fury on him.\n\n               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.\n\n               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the \n               discussion, as if this fight was normal business.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him \n                         off. But who will go to him? Not I. \n                         If I came under the sword of this \n                         murderer, I would end up like my \n                         nephew. And not you, the sight of my \n                         faggot son would only encourage an \n                         enemy to take over this country. So \n                         whom do I send?\n\n               Longshanks calculates.\n\n               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY\n\n               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase \n               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.\n\n               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, \n               who receives a report from a scout.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         A royal entourage comes, flying \n                         banners of truce, and the standards \n                         of Longshanks himself!\n\n               Wallace buckles on his sword.\n\n               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY\n\n               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men \n               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent.\n\n               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no \n               threatening moves.\n\n               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle \n               of his broadsword, ready.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Longshanks! I have come.\n\n               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, \n               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the \n               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only \n               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and \n               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another \n               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves \n               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!\n\n               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!\n\n               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more \n               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she \n               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.\n\n               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, \n               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.\n\n               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she \n               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.\n\n               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive \n               yet proud curtsey.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I am the Princess of Wales.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?\n\n               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I come as the king's servant, and \n                         with his authority.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         It's battle I want, not talk.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         But now that I am here, will you \n                         speak with a woman?\n\n               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading \n               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous \n               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg \n               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and \n               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, \n               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, \n               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots \n               surround the tent, ready for ambush.\n\n               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, \n               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The \n               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower \n               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.\n\n               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I understand that you have recently \n                         been given the rank of knight.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I have been given nothing. God makes \n                         men what they are.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Did God make you the sacker of \n                         peaceful cities? The executioner of \n                         the king's nephew, my husband's own \n                         cousin?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         York was the staging point for every \n                         invasion of my country. And that \n                         royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, \n                         even women and children, from the \n                         city walls.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         That is not possible.\n\n               But knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly \n               dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Longshanks did far worse, the last \n                         time he took a Scottish city.\n\n               The Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES...\n\n                                     CRONY\n                              (Latin)\n                         He is a murdering bandit, he lies.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                              (Latin!)\n                         I am no bandit. And I do not lie.\n\n               They are startled at Wallace's fluency in Latin.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Or in French if you prefer that: \n                         Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to \n                         his face, and see if his eyes can \n                         convince you of the truth.\n\n               She stares for a long moment at Wallace's eyes.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Hamilton, leave us.\n\n                                     CRONY (HAMILTON)\n                         M'lady --\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Leave us now.\n\n               He reluctantly obeys. Seeing that she wants the exchange to \n               be private, Wallace turns and nods for his men to leave.\n\n               Stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non-stop, \n               leans in and whispers to William...\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Her husband's more of a queen than \n                         she is. Did you know that?\n\n               Stephen moves off with Hamish and Campbell. Wallace and the \n               princess are left alone.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Let us talk plainly. You invade \n                         England. But you cannot complete the \n                         conquest, so far from your shelter \n                         and supply. The King proposes that \n                         you withdraw your attack. In return \n                         he grants you title, estates, and \n                         this chest with a thousand pounds of \n                         gold, which I am to pay to you \n                         personally.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         A Lordship. And gold. That I should \n                         become Judas.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Peace is made is such ways.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!\n\n               The outburst startles even those watching from a distance.\n\n               The Princess is mesmerized by Wallace's passion.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I understand you have suffered. I \n                         know... about your woman.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         She was my wife. We married in secret \n                         because I would not share her with \n                         an English lord. They killed her to \n                         get to me. And she was pregnant.\n\n               The Princess is stunned; Wallace is dead still.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I've never told anyone. I don't know \n                         why I tell you -- except because you \n                         look... much like her. And someday \n                         you will be a queen, and you must \n                         open your eyes!\n                              (beat)\n                         Tell your king that William Wallace \n                         will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, \n                         while I live.\n\n               The Princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of \n               him, and lowers herself to her knees. The Crony and her other \n               attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. \n                         Not from the king, but from myself. \n                         And not to you, but to the orphans \n                         of your country.\n\n               She lifts her face. Their eyes hold a moment too long.\n\n               LATER, EXT. FIELD - DAY\n\n               Wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of \n               their company and watch as the Princess' procession leaves.\n\n               Hamish studies Wallace's face; Wallace notices and gives him \n               a non-committal shrug. As the carriage rolls away, its window \n               curtains lift back slightly. All they see are the Princess' \n               fingers, but they know she looked back. Wallace reins his \n               horse away, to ride back to camp.\n\n               INT. EDWARD'S PALACE - DAY\n\n               The doors open; the Princess enters Longshanks' war council; \n               Prince Edward is there, among a dozen others.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled \n                         by the heathen. So he accepted our \n                         bribe.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         No. He did not.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         Then why does he stay? My scouts say \n                         he has not advanced.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         He waits. For you. He says he will \n                         attack no more towns -- if you are \n                         man enough to come fight him.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         You spoke with this Wallace in \n                         private. What kind of man is he?\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         ...A mindless barbarian.

His army starves. Our stall \n                         has worked, he must withdraw. You \n                         may return to your embroidery.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Humbly, M'lord.\n\n               She barely curtseys, and starts out.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You brought back the money, of course?\n\n               He already knows she didn't; Hamilton is standing near him.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         No. I have it to ease the suffering \n                         of the children of this war.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                              (glances at son)\n                         This is what happens when you must \n                         send a woman. And a fool.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Forgive me, Sire. I thought that \n                         generosity might demonstrate your \n                         greatness to those you mean to rule.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         My greatness is better demonstrated \n                         with this.\n\n               From a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and \n               throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         The weapon has been outlawed by the \n                         Pope himself!\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         So the Scots will have none of them, \n                         will they? My armorers have already \n                         made a thousand.\n\n               Longshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly \n               pale.\n\n               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY\n\n               The Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace \n               is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, \n               beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in \n               distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         William -- French guards?\n\n               The riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes \n               a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette.\n\n               Wallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit.\n\n               She trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French \n               guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves \n               to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding \n               cape.\n\n               Secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow.\n\n               EXT. A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY\n\n               Wallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, \n               Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen \n               have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. \n               As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position \n               and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind \n               the armor.\n\n               William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air \n               and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt \n               what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         That is why the Pope outlawed the \n                         weapon! It makes war too terrible.\n\n                                     MORNAY\n                         How many does Longshanks have?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         A thousand.\n                              (beat)\n                         You have made me Guardian of Scotland. \n                         So I tell you this is what we face.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         We must sue for peace.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Peace?!\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         We cannot defeat this --\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         With cavalry -- not heavy, like the \n                         English, but light, fast horsemen, \n                         like you nobles employ -- we could \n                         outmaneuver their bowmen!\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         It is suicide.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Sir William --\n\n               The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to \n               intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         We won at Stirling and still you \n                         quibbled! We won at York and you \n                         would not support us! Then I said \n                         nothing! Now I say you are cowards!\n\n               The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen \n               are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, \n               backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Please, Sir William! Speak with me \n                         alone! I beg you!\n\n               The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the \n               target Wallace shot, so they are alone.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         You have achieved more than anyone \n                         dreamed. But fighting these odds \n                         looks like rage, not courage. Peace \n                         offers its rewards! Has war become a \n                         habit you cannot break?\n\n               The question strikes deep.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         War finds me willing. I know it won't \n                         bring back all I have lost. But it \n                         can bring what none of us have ever \n                         had -- a country of our own. For \n                         that we need a king. We need you.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         I am trying.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Then tell me what a king is! Is he a \n                         man who believes only what others \n                         believe? Is he one who calculates \n                         the numbers for and against him but \n                         never weighs the strength in your \n                         own heart? There is strength in you. \n                         I see it. I know it.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         I must... consult with my father.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         And I will consult with mine.\n\n               Robert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the \n               other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They \n               look to him; what do we do now?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Remember when the English turned \n                         their hounds on us? Maybe we should \n                         introduce them to our dogs.\n\n               INT. THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER\n\n               In the faint nimbus of the single candle, young Robert sits \n               across from his leper father. The son grips his own head, as \n               if stunned by a blow.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         This... cannot be the way.\n\n                                     THE LEPER\n                         You have said yourself that the nobles \n                         will not support Wallace, so how \n                         does it help us to join the side \n                         that is slaughtered?\n\n               Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays \n               his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand.\n\n                                     THE LEPER\n                         My son. Look at me. I cannot be king. \n                         You, and you alone, can rule Scotland. \n                         What I tell you, you must do -- for \n                         yourself, and for your country.\n\n               Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not \n               look away.\n\n               EXT. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY\n\n               The Scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in \n               the gray mists. They see glimpses of the enemy in the \n               distance. Wallace deploys the Scots: Campbell with the \n               schiltrons (spear formations), Stephen with the infantry, \n               the noble Mornay leading the cavalry, and with Wallace and \n               Hamish on horseback, looking over the field. Hamish sees \n               gazing up at an empty hill above the field.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         The Bruce is not coming, William.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.\n\n               He'd better, the odds look long. And it's nasty ground; one \n               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English \n               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick \n               smoke to hide their movements.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Stephen ready?\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Aye.\n\n               The Priest from their home village is moving through the \n               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two \n               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, \n               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to \n               join the schiltrons.\n\n               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS\n\n               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.\n\n               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS\n\n               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking \n               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!\n\n               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He \n               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some \n               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Irish troops!\n\n               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY\n\n               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears \n               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         So that's where Longshanks got his \n                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill \n                         Scottish cousins for the English.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         Their families are starving, they'll \n                         feed them however they can. If you \n                         don't want to fight them --\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         No. I'll stand with you.\n\n               Loyal to the end. Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, \n               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, \n               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know \n               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the \n               English heavy cavalry advancing.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         They can't be that stupid to attack \n                         the schiltrons again.\n\n               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English \n               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, \n               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         It's only a faint to shield the \n                         crossbows!\n\n               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the \n               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you \n               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the \n               front ranks of the schiltrons.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!\n\n               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers \n               with ten war dogs.\n\n               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp \n               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long \n               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their \n               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the \n               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash \n               the dogs, fear races through the English line.\n\n               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, \n               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, \n               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; \n               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked \n               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing.\n\n               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay \n               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, \n               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and \n               are regrouping.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Now! Charge! Charge them!\n\n               Mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.\n\n               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND\n\n               Longshanks and his officers see Mornay and his cavalry melt \n               away. The English general looks knowingly at Longshanks.\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                         Mornay?\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         For double his lands in Scotland, \n                         and matching estates in England.\n\n               WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN\n\n               They see the Scottish army abandoned.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Betrayed!\n\n               Wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce.\n\n               He looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another \n               volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are \n               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and \n               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his \n               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen \n               and the infantrymen race behind him.\n\n               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace \n               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with \n               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another...\n\n               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, \n               hacking the knights as they run by.\n\n               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the \n               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; \n               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the \n               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, \n               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.\n\n               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND\n\n               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.\n\n                                     GENERAL\n                         My God, and still they come!\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         Use the reinforcements! But take \n                         Wallace alive!\n\n               The General signals and the English reinforcements surge \n               into the battle.\n\n               IN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE\n\n               On horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of \n               the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the \n               schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the \n               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another \n               soldier. Wallace dismounts.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Hamish! Ham --\n\n               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen \n               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and \n               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace \n               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish...\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Get him away!\n\n               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward \n               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the \n               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.\n\n               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then \n               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         A charge! Form up! Form up!\n\n               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.\n\n               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder \n               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight \n               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.\n\n               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp \n               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending \n               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...\n\n               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The \n               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over \n               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams \n               into him, William also unseats the rider.\n\n               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet \n               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.\n\n               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, \n               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he \n               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of \n               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the \n               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.\n\n               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He \n               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him \n               absolution.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Fight me! Fight me!\n\n               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged \n               as he screams.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         FIGHT ME!\n\n               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being \n               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a \n               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.\n\n               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!\n\n               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to \n               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!\n\n               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out \n               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen \n               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him \n               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, \n               as Stephen mounts too.\n\n               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to \n               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see \n               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the \n               Scots.\n\n               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire \n               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have \n               died along with his heart.\n\n               LONGSHANKS\n\n               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the \n               Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied.\n\n               EXT. ROAD - SUNSET\n\n               Remnants of the defeated army straggle past. Wallace and \n               Stephen are trying to help Hamish carry his father, but now \n               old Campbell says...\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Son... I want to die on the ground.\n\n               But as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at \n               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. \n                         Goodbye, boys.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         No. You're going to live.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         I don't think I can do without one \n                         of those... whatever it is...\n\n               Hamish is too grief-stricken to speak.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         You... were like my father...\n\n               Old Campbell rallies one more time for this.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         ...And glad to die, like him... So \n                         you could be the men you are. All of \n                         ya.\n\n               The last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too.\n\n                                     CAMPBELL\n                         I'm a happy man.\n\n               Hamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has \n               died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the \n               people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat.\n\n               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY\n\n               Wallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the \n               chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto \n               the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks \n               from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on \n               the nobles' face, and follow William out.\n\n               INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n               Hamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- \n               but he is gone.\n\n               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT\n\n               Wallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at \n               Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. \n               But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the \n               wounds, nothing seems to touch him.\n\n               With his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth \n               from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, \n               filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly \n               white, something from a better, purer world.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               INT. PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT\n\n               Thunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire \n               are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the \n               far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands \n               at the window and watches the rain against the panes.\n\n                                     ADVISOR\n                         Their nobles have sworn allegiance, \n                         M'lord.

It is very cold -- \n                         is it not, our flower?\n\n               From the other side of the window, we see the Princess as \n               she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the \n               window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her \n               eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass.\n\n               INT. BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER\n\n               The elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, \n               stares across the table at his son.\n\n                                     LEPER\n                         I am the one who is rotting.

MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               Mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and \n               carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the \n               restless sleep of a tortured soul.\n\n               He thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS \n               of Wallace riding toward him.\n\n               He wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats!\n\n               Coming closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- \n               and those strange, approaching hoofbeats...\n\n               WALLACE, ON HORSEBACK\n\n               rides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His \n               horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, \n               on foot, pursuing.\n\n               At a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher.\n\n               IN HIS BED, MORNAY\n\n               sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides \n               through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down.\n\n               Out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace \n               trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs \n               his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window!\n\n               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - SLOW MOTION\n\n               The horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the \n               castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle \n               servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse \n               surface, and swim to the shore, escaping!\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY\n\n               The news has spread through the countryside. In the town \n               square, drunken Scotsmen chant...\n\n                                     PEOPLE\n                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!\n\n               Old Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle \n               on the hill above the town.\n\n               INT. BRUCE CASTLE - DAY\n\n               Robert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from \n               far below. Old Craig enters.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Is it true about Mornay?\n\n               Craig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         And he rode through the window? My \n                         God.\n\n               He can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the \n               people CHANTING...\n\n               EXT. LONDON - GARDENS - DAY\n\n               Longshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent \n               with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it.\n\n                                     LONGSHANKS\n                         His legend grows!

I have \n                         picked you a Queen.\n\n               EXT. THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY\n\n               Locharmbie is a small, picturesque castle on a hillside. As \n               the queen's entourage moves through the gates, they close \n               behind her. She steps out of the carriage and moves into\n\n               INT. CASTLE - THE GREAT HALL - DAY\n\n               Inside the great hall are thirty killers, led by their CHIEF \n               ASSASSIN, a cutthroat with a mangled eye.\n\n                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN\n                         We came in small groups, so the rebels \n                         would not suspect.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         And you have reached Wallace's men?\n\n                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN\n                         We tell the villagers, and the \n                         traitors pass it on. All that's left \n                         is for you to say where.\n\n               EXT. MARION'S GROVE - NIGHT\n\n               Wallace is in the grove of trees where Marion is buried.\n\n               Drinking in the silence, his own isolation. He hears a RUSTLE \n               behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. Then his face \n               registers... it's Hamish and Stephen.\n\n               Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- \n               unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them.\n\n               INT. CAVE - NIGHT\n\n               They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's \n               dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Thanks for the food and drink. And \n                         for bringing 'em yourselves.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         We're here to stay. We don't care to \n                         live, if we can't fight beside ya.\n\n               Stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. He swigs, \n               hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, \n               but smiles for the first time in many weeks.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         There is... one thing, William. \n                         Longshanks is offering a truce. He \n                         has dispatched his daughter-in-law \n                         as his emissary, and she has sent \n                         word that she wishes to meet you -- \n                         in a barn.\n\n               Wallace frowns; a barn?\n\n               EXT. A BARN IN THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY\n\n               Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood. As he \n               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a \n               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. But in full view \n               of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward.\n\n               INSIDE THE BARN\n\n               are the assassins, killing knives ready.\n\n                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN\n                         It's William Wallace, sure! And... \n                         he's given up his sword! Be ready!\n\n               They position themselves at every entrance.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE BARN\n\n               Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the \n               door. But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy \n               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from \n               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize \n               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they \n               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.\n\n               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place \n               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on \n               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand \n               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. \n               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside.\n\n               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               The Princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a \n               bonfire. She stands on the wall, looking out at it. And then \n               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and \n               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking \n               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and \n               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is \n               silhouetted, and he can see her.\n\n               The lone rider is William Wallace.\n\n               CLOSE - A CANDLE\n\n               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into \n               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns \n               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.\n\n               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS\n\n               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE\n\n               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared \n               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.\n\n               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the \n               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside.\n\n               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first \n               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for \n               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them \n               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the \n               implications of this moment.\n\n               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through \n               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each \n               other in the darkness. Then she strikes a match and relights \n               the candle, and they look at each other.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         A meeting in a barn. It had to be a \n                         trap. And only you would know I would \n                         be aware of it.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         It does me good to see you.\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         I am much diminished since we met.\n\n               She wants to say something -- but instead she says something \n               else.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         There will be a new shipment of \n                         supplies coming north next month. \n                         Food and weapons. They will trav --\n\n                                     WILLIAM\n                         No. Stop. I didn't come here for \n                         that.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Then why did you come?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Why did you?\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Because of the way you're looking at \n                         me now. The same way... as when we \n                         met.\n\n               He turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I know. You looked at me... and saw \n                         her.\n\n               He twists back toward the window.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         You must forgive me what I feel. No \n                         man has ever looked at me as you \n                         did.\n\n               Surprised, he looks at her now.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         You have... you have a husband.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I have taken vows. More than one. \n                         I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, \n                         and sworn to give him a son. And I \n                         cannot keep both promises.\n\n               Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an \n               unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         You understand. Consider, before you \n                         laugh and say no. You will never own \n                         a throne, though you deserve one. \n                         But just as the sun will rise \n                         tomorrow, some man will rule England. \n                         And what if his veins ran not with \n                         the blood of Longshanks, but with \n                         that of a true king?\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I cannot love you for the sake of \n                         revenge.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         No. But can you love me for the sake \n                         of all you loved and lost? Or simply \n                         love me... because I love you?\n\n               Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.\n\n               IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED\n\n               we see the surging, pent-up passion... and\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               THE LOVERS\n\n               Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays \n               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across \n               their faces.\n\n               Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, \n               as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of \n               bed, rushing to the window to look out.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         No one! Hurry!\n\n               He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear \n               path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and \n               touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask...\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         When we... did you think of her?\n\n               Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- \n               her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go.\n\n               EXT. GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT\n\n               Wallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies.\n\n               MONTAGE\n\n               -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way \n               to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing \n               and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, \n               as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked \n               and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men \n               away, the people cheering him...\n\n               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT\n\n               Once again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Rest, William.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I rest.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Your rest is making me exhausted.\n\n               Stephen offers the jug; Wallace declines.\n\n                                     STEPHEN\n                         Come, it'll help you sleep.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Aye. But it won't let me dream.\n\n               Pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down.\n\n               LONGSHANKS, INT. HIS PALACE - NIGHT\n\n               He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still \n               he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. But he \n               ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting.\n\n               THE PRINCESS, EXT. THE WALLS OF HER CASTLE - NIGHT\n\n               she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts.\n\n               ROBERT THE BRUCE, IN A STONE ROOM OF HIS CASTLE\n\n               sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. The coffin \n               is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his \n               father as a knight in final repose. Ranks of candles light \n               the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone. A SHUFFLE... \n               Robert looks up to see old Craig.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         May he rest in peace...

Wallace has the commoners \n                         stirred up again, from the Highland \n                         clans to the lowland villages. In \n                         another six months Christ and the \n                         Apostles could not govern this \n                         country.\n\n               Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Longshanks knows his son will scarcely \n                         be able to rule England, much less \n                         half of France. He needs Scotland \n                         settled, and he trusts you, after \n                         Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he \n                         will recognize you as king of \n                         Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to \n                         this as well.\n\n               He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in \n               Scotland. The Bruce barely glances at it.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         If I pay homage to another's throne, \n                         then how am I a king?\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Homage is nothing. It is the crown \n                         that matters!\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         The crown is that of Scotland. And \n                         Scotland is William Wallace.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         That is another matter. There is a \n                         price to all this, required both by \n                         Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, \n                         and you will be our king. And we \n                         will have peace.\n\n               Robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at Craig.\n\n               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT\n\n               A commotion; the nobles, their heads hooded, are led in on \n               horseback by guerrillas from the village. The nobles stop, \n               feel their hoods pulled off, and see Wallace.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Sir William.

FOREST - NIGHT\n\n               Wallace stands alone, looking at the moon and stars.

ROAD INTO EDINBURGH - SUNSET\n\n               William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking \n               down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his \n               dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it \n               to Hamish.\n\n                                     HAMISH\n                         Keep these.

Tears roll \n               down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, \n               Wallace rides away.\n\n               EXT.

THE HOUSE\n\n               Wallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops.\n\n               Bruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. \n               Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto \n               Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters \n               drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace.\n\n               English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, \n               and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if \n               broadswords might spring from his boots.\n\n               They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the \n               Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out \n               the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs \n               the English Captain of the soldiers.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         He is not to be harmed.

ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY\n\n               A procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way \n               toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his \n               head bare to the sun.

His lips are so parched they bleed.\n\n               INT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY\n\n               Edward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, \n               breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves.\n\n               INT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY\n\n               The Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's \n               bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Is it true? Wallace is captured?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Simply because he eluded your trap, \n                         do you think he is more than a man? \n                         My father is dying. Perhaps you should \n                         think of our coronation.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         When will his trial be?\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Wallace's? For treason there is no \n                         trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, \n                         then executed.\n\n               With a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face.\n\n               INT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY\n\n               The Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Longshanks promised!\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         You are surprised he would lie? \n                         Balliol was murdered in a church \n                         yesterday. You are Longshanks' new \n                         designate. You will be king.\n\n               INT. TOWER DUNGEON\n\n               Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal \n               Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates.\n\n                                     ROYAL MAGISTRATE\n                         William Wallace!

Do you confess? ...DO YOU \n                         CONFESS?!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I do not confess.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive \n                         they purification... And in the end, \n                         I promise you'll beg for the axe.\n\n               EXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER\n\n               The stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to \n               this day as the Wallace Tower.\n\n               INT. PRISON - NIGHT\n\n               Wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints.\n\n               We can only see his eyes, as he prays.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         I am so afraid... Give me strength.\n\n               OUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR\n\n               The jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters.\n\n                                     JAILER\n                         Your Highness!\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I will see the prisoner.\n\n                                     JAILER\n                         We've orders from the king --\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         The king will be dead in a month! \n                         And his son is a weakling! Who do \n                         you think will rule this kingdom? \n                         Now OPEN THIS DOOR!\n\n               The jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock \n               at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright.\n\n                                     JAILER\n                         On your feet, you filth!\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Stop! Leave me!\n                              (they hesitate)\n                         There is no way out of this hell! \n                         Leave me with him!\n\n               Reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they \n               can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's \n               eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- \n               dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries \n               to distract her.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         M'lady... what kindness of you to \n                         visit a stranger.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Sir, I... come to beg you to confess \n                         all, and swear allegiance to the \n                         king, that he might show you mercy.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Will he show mercy to my country? \n                         Will he take back his soldiers, and \n                         let us rule ourselves?\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps \n                         even live in the Tower. In time, who \n                         knows what can happen, if you can \n                         only live.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         If I swear to him, then everything I \n                         am is dead already.\n\n               She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the \n               tears. And the jailers are watching.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Your people are lucky to have a \n                         princess so kind that she can grieve \n                         at the death of a stranger.\n\n               She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but \n               she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading...\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         You will die! It will be awful!\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         Every man dies. Not every man really \n                         lives.\n\n               She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers...\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Drink this! It will dull your pain.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         It will numb my wits, and I must \n                         have them all. If I'm senseless, or \n                         if I wail, then Longshanks will have \n                         broken me.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I can't bear the thought of your \n                         torture. Take it!\n\n               On the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air \n               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing \n               suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, \n               her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the \n               mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits \n               the purple drug out through the mouth hole.\n\n               INT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT\n\n               Longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption.\n\n               Edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his \n               eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I have come to beg for the life of \n                         William Wallace.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         You fancy him.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         I respect him. At worst he was a \n                         worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou \n                         great king... and win the respect of \n                         your own people.\n\n               Longshanks shakes his head.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Even now, you are incapable of mercy?\n\n               The king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes.\n\n               The princess looks at her husband.\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         Nor you. To you that word is as \n                         unfamiliar as love.\n\n                                     EDWARD\n                         Before he lost his powers of speech, \n                         he told me his one comfort was that \n                         he would live to know Wallace was \n                         dead.\n\n               She leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The \n               guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's \n               eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once \n               showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses \n               to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear...\n\n                                     PRINCESS\n                         You see? Death comes to us all. And \n                         it comes to William Wallace. But \n                         before death comes to you, know this: \n                         your blood dies with you. A child \n                         who is not of your line grows in my \n                         belly. Your son will not sit long on \n                         the throne. I swear it.\n\n               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back \n               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband \n               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the \n               dying king rasping the air like a saw.\n\n               EXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY\n\n               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer \n               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped \n               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through \n               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: \n               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.\n\n               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in \n               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street \n               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.\n\n               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing \n               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest \n               of the crowd jeers more.\n\n               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution \n               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table \n               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an \n               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         We will use it all before this is \n                         over. Or fall to your knees now, \n                         declare yourself the king's loyal \n                         subject, and beg his mercy, and you \n                         shall have it.\n\n               He emphasizes \"mercy\" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is \n               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows \n               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...\n\n               WE INTERCUT:\n\n               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE \n               from her room in the palace...\n\n               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, \n               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.\n\n               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.\n\n               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in \n               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered \n               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.\n\n               ON THE EXECUTION STAND\n\n               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around \n               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.\n\n                                     CROWD\n                         That's it! Stretch him!\n\n               In the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries \n               through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace \n               is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the \n               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go \n               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods \n               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the \n               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, \n                         kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, \n                         and you will feel no more.\n\n               With great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate \n               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.\n\n               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Very well then. Rack him.\n\n               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, \n               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by \n               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet \n               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and \n               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man \n                         remains conscious through such pain. \n                         Enough?\n\n               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, \n               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we \n               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, \n               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; \n               Wallace wants to say something.\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         That... will... clear your sinuses.\n\n               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears.\n\n               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift \n               the terrible instruments of dissection.\n\n               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE \n               as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside \n               him.\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                         It can all end. Right now! Bliss. \n                         Peace. Just say it. Cry out. \"Mercy!\" \n                         Yes?... Yes?\n\n               The crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the \n               procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting...\n\n                                     CROWD\n                         Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy!\n\n               Wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET!\n\n                                     MAGISTRATE\n                              (booming)\n                         The prisoner wishes to say a word!\n\n               SILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray...\n\n                                     HAMISH AND STEPHEN\n                         Mercy, William... Say Mercy...\n\n               Wallace's eyes flutter, and clear. He fights through the \n               pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams...\n\n                                     WALLACE\n                         FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM!\n\n               The shout RINGS through the town. Hamish hears it. The \n               Princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, \n               just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. Longshanks \n               and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the \n               wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert \n               the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as \n               if he has heard...\n\n               IN THE LONDON SQUARE\n\n               the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English \n               strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives \n               a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his \n               head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and \n               Wallace looks toward the crowd.\n\n               THE CROWD, WALLACE'S POV\n\n               He sees Hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing...\n\n               SLOW MOTION - THE AXE\n\n               begins to drop.\n\n               WALLACE'S POV\n\n               In the last half-moment of his life, when he has already \n               stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone \n               standing at Hamish's shoulder. She is beautiful, smiling, \n               serene.\n\n               She is Marion.\n\n                                                              CUT TO BLACK:\n\n               ROBERT THE BRUCE\n\n               His face has changed. He is standing AT THE OPEN GRAVE WHERE \n               MARION LAY, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. \n               He holds the handkerchief. As he tucks it into his own pocket, \n               and we MOVE IN on his eyes, we realize the VOICE OVER belongs \n               to him.\n\n                                     ROBERT (V.O.)\n                         After the beheading, William Wallace's \n                         body was torn to pieces. His head \n                         was set on London bridge, where \n                         passerby were invited to jeer at the \n                         man who had caused so much fear in \n                         England.\n                              (beat)\n                         His arms and legs were sent to the \n                         four corners of Britain as warning.\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH TOWNS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY\n\n               We see the people, as the remains of William Wallace are \n               displayed in a box. The faces of the young men are fiery.\n\n                                     ROBERT (V.O.)\n                         It did not have the effect that \n                         Longshanks planned.\n\n               More young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and \n               gather into fighting units. Among them is Hamish, carrying a \n               shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, \n               and the words \"For Freedom.\"\n\n               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY\n\n               Robert the Bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of \n               the Scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of Scots, \n               sits on his horse and looks down at the English generals in \n               their martial finery. The English are haughty, victorious, \n               at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the \n               ceremony of submission from Scotland's new king.\n\n                                     ROBERT (V.O.)\n                         And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a \n                         body of Scottish veterans, rode out \n                         to pay homage to the armies of the \n                         English king, and accept his \n                         endorsement of my crown.\n\n               FROM BELOW, ON THE OPEN PLAIN - DAY\n\n               The Scots -- the remains of William Wallace's army -- look \n               so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. \n               One ENGLISH COMMANDER turns and jokes with another...\n\n                                     ENGLISH COMMANDER\n                         I hope you washed your ass this mornin -- \n                         it's never been kissed by a king \n                         before.\n\n               UP ON THE HILL, Robert the Bruce sits on his horse, and waits. \n               He looks down at the English generals, at their banners, \n               their army. He looks down the ranks at his own.\n\n               He sees Hamish. Stephen. Old MacClannough is there, his eyes \n               watery, his weapon sharp. The Scottish bride Lord Bottoms \n               took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside \n               her. Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all.\n\n               Old Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside \n               the Bruce, grows impatient.\n\n                                     CRAIG\n                         Come, let's get it over with.\n\n               But Robert holds something -- uncurling his fist, he looks \n               at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. The \n               nobles start to rein their horses toward the English.\n\n                                     ROBERT\n                         Stop.\n\n               Robert the Bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his \n               breastplate, and turns to the Highlanders who line the hilltop \n               with him. He takes a long breath, and shouts --\n\n                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE\n                         You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed \n                         with me!\n\n               Bruce's broadsword slides from its scabbard. A cry rises \n               from Highlanders, as from a tomb, rising --\n\n                                     SCOTS\n                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!\n\n               The chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. The \n               Scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the English are \n               shocked even more. Robert the Bruce, king of Scotland, spurs \n               his horse into full gallop toward the English, and the \n               Highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run \n               through hell itself. In SLOW MOTION we see their faces...\n\n               And OVER THIS, we hear the voice of William Wallace...\n\n                                     WALLACE'S VOICE\n                         In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots \n                         of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, \n                         charged the fields of Bannockburn. \n                         They fought like warrior poets. They \n                         fought like Scotsmen. And won their \n                         freedom. Forever.\n\n               On Wallace's army behind Robert the Bruce, charging down the \n               hill to victory and glory, we slow to FREEZE FRAME and hear \n               their chant, huge, echoing...\n\n                                     SCOTS\n                         Wal-lace!
