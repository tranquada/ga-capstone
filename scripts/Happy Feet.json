I thought this one\r\n             was barren.\r\n\r\nIN THE DOME\r\n\r\nWe`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of\r\na stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this\r\nspace, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are\r\ntalking, subtitled:\r\n\r\n                       VOICE#2\r\n             More or less. But one of the stars we're\r\n             harvesting supports these things here.\r\n\r\nProjected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in\r\nwinter with tiny people milling around in black coats\r\n\r\n                                                        (CONTINUED)\r\n                                                        85.\r\nCONTINUED:\r\n\r\n                         VOICE#1\r\n             So...?\r\n\r\n                       VOICE#2\r\n             Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know\r\n             about before was these things here\r\n\r\nAn image of the dancing penguins appears.\r\n\r\n                       VOICE#2 (CONT'D)\r\n             Just thought you'd want to see them\r\n             before...you know.\r\n\r\nThe shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.\r\n\r\n                        VOICE#1\r\n             Hmm.   Charming\r\n\r\n                         VOICE#2\r\n             So.    We go ahead. Or...?\r\n\r\n                       VOICE#1\r\n             No. Better leave them be. See what\r\n             sector twelves got to offer instead.\r\n\r\nThe bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of\r\nthe universe\r\n\r\nWith that the two figures head off across the great shadowy\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nThe projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the\r\ngiant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge\r\npenguins.\r\n\r\nAs they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind\r\ntheir backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.\r\n\r\nRUN TITLES\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\n\n\n\nHappy Feet\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0George Miller\u00a0\u00a0John Collee\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Animation\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Family\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:26:30.885942"}
