LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY\n\n\tThe hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is\n\tspeaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is\n\ta projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,\n\tFANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and\n\tTRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser\n\tpointing device.  We see her from a considerable\n\tdistance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and\n\tassured.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tOur society creates these socially\n\t\tand psychically disenfranchised\n\t\tmen, and their revenge on society\n\t\tis terrible.  They are hard to\n\t\tcatch.  They are \"the nice guy next\n\t\tdoor,\" their employers -- if they\n\t\twork at all -- find them quiet and\n\t\tuncomplaining.  Early abuse and\n\t\trejection have taught them\n\t\tpassivity.  Only in their violent\n\t\tfantasies do they feel alive.  What\n\t\tthey seek in their frenzied\n\t\tassaults on their victims is relief\n\t\tfrom passivity.  For these men, ten\n\t\tminutes relief is worth far more\n\t\tthan the life of another human\n\t\tbeing.  Torture, the pain they\n\t\tinflict, the screams of the victim,\n\t\tare all part of the ritual that\n\t\tgives them a brief respite from\n\t\ttheir own psychic pain.  And then\n\t\tthe depression, the forgetting, the\n\t\tfeeling of sadness and despair\n\t\tbegins the cycle all over again.\n\t\tLike addicts seeking their drug,\n\t\tAlbert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,\n\t\tBerkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they\n\t\tseek out their next victim.\n\n\tDuring the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera\n\thas moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the\n\tbalcony railing.\n\n\tCLOSEUP: HELEN\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tThe cycle is endless until they are\n\t\tcaught.  And they are caught by\n\t\tchance -- they run a red light, and\n\t\ta body is in the trunk.  A leaking\t\n\t\tpipe brings a plumber to a basement\n\t\twhere they is the smell of death.\n\n\tHer eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in\n\tthe balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.\n\n\tHELEN'S POV:\n\n\tSitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED\n\tMAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed\n\tarms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.\n\n\tHELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:\n\n\tBackstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly\n\talert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of\n\texposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the\n\twings on the other side of the stage, also springs to\n\tattention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...\n\n\tTheir POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer\n\tthere.\n\n\tHELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tAt any time, right now, as you\n\t\tlisten, the FBI estimates there are\n\t\t30 to 35 serial killers stalking\n\t\ttheir victims.  The serial killer is\n\t\ta plaque that must be addressed not\n\t\tonly by the law, but by science.\n\t\tFlorida spent eight million dollars\n\t\tto execute Ted Bundy.  It would\n\t\thave been better spent building a\n\t\tforensic penal facility devoted to\n\t\tresearch.\n\n\tOnce again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself\n\tthat the smiling man is not there...\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tConfined for life, without parole,\n\t\tand subjected to scientific study,\n\t\tthese men's lives might finally, in\n\t\tsome small measure, educate and\n\t\tthereby protect society.  Thank\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tApplause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are\n\tcarefully casing the crowd.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tLATER:\n\n\tThe crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the\n\tladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes \n\tas well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE\n\tTHROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO\n\tDRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY\n\n\tTHE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks\n\taround.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He\n\thastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.\n\tBefore the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to\n\tstand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the\n\thigh heels to a stall several doors down.\n\n\tCLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:\n\n\tAnd a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the\n\tankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from\n\tview as\n\n\tHELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper\n\taround the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise\n\tmakes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is\n\tjust able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES\n\tDOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.\n\n\tLike a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently\n\tyanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.\n\n\tCORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears\n\tthe clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He\n\treacts...\n\n\tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED\n\n\tThe RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a\n\thook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP (o.s.)\n\t\tDoctor Hudson?  Are you okay in\n\t\tthere?\n\n\tThe MAN lets slip a little slack.\n\n\tHELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,\n\tget just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little\n\tscream.\n\n\tCORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous\n\tsounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for\n\ta split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now\n\tthere is more SOUND from inside...\n\n\tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tCOP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder\n\twe see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at\n\ther throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the\n\ttoilet seat.\n\n\tCOP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we\n\tsee a broom closet door opening.\n\n\tHELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a\n\tsecond, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,\n\this gun still in his hand.\n\n\tRED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at\n\tHELEN.\n\n\tCOP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions\n\tin his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,\n\tthe sound reverberating against the tile walls.\n\n\tSTAGE AREA\n\n\tThe audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.\n\tHELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSLAM CUT:\n\n\tINT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT\n\n\tAs HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try\n\tdesperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now\n\tpale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her\n\teyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tAndy!  Andy!\n\n\tShe races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT\n\tFEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a\n\thall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...\n\n\tINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS\n\n\tThe room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it\n\tis used on and off by her computer, Andy.)\n\n\tHELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO\n\tHERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,\n\twhere she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)\n\tThe sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm\n\therself with the sound of her own voice...\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tIt is October twelfth, 1994 in the\n\t\tcity of San Francisco, California,\n\t\tU.S.A., the strongest, richest,\n\t\tmost stable and happiest country in\n\t\tthe world.  That is the sole place\n\t\tof life in the universe.  Under\n\t\tGod.\n\n\tCLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,\n\tothers scattering from the nervous haste...\n\n\tCLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she\n\ttosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard\n\treflection with a certain detachment...\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tGood God.  What happened to you?\n\n\tShe barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will\n\therself from near-hysteria to relative calm...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tHALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.\n\tShe pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.\n\tOf the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The\n\tother shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the\n\tscreen comes a command.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHESSMASTER\n\t\t'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam\n\t\tmove.'\n\n\tShe studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a\n\tmove.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other\n\tcomputer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHESSMASTER\n\t\t'Lousy move.  Not really into this\n\t\tgame, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've\n\t\tgot a feeling about you.  Let's\n\t\tmeet.  Like a date.'\n\n\tHELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\t'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your\n\t\tlife.'\n\n\t\t\t\tCHESSMASTER\n\t\t'Another romantic dream gone all to\n\t\thell.'\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\t'Maybe it's better to just dream\n\t\ton; avoid the disappointments of\n\t\tlife.  Come on, move.'\n\n\tShe pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window\n\tcurtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the\n\tT-shirt HELEN wears says \"Shrinks 'R' Us.\"  She crosses to\n\tthe window with her glass of cognac, looks out.\n\n\tVIEW:\n\n\tA sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The\n\tmorning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.\n\tHELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the\n\tair, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream\n\thorror of the night...\n\n\tO.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.\n\n\tCLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the\n\thandset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\t\t(carefully)\n\t\tYes?\n\t\t\t(listens)\n\t\tYou son-of-a-bitch!  Son of\n\t\ta bitch...\n\n\tStiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tYou filthy... son of a bitch!\n\n\tOn the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his\n\tmove: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:\n\n\t\t\t\tCOMPUTER\n\t\t\t(filter)\n\t\tYou Queen is in check.\n\t\tProtect your Queen.\n\n\tOVER CREDITS:\n\n\tHOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is\n\tmorning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in\n\ta long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly\n\tnear the end of a satisfactory run.\n\n\tTHE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY\n\tSLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW\n\tAT WORK HERE.\n\n\tNOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S\n\tOPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE\n\n\tA SCREAM!\n\n\tEND TITLE AND CREDITS:\n\n\tINT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY\n\n\tMUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST\n\tDIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...\n\n\tTHE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;\n\tcentered in the right side of the upper chest, near the\n\tshoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES\n\tFROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none\n\tin the circle.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J. (V.O.)\n\t\tMy third grade teacher at the\n\t\tconvent shot better than that.\n\n\tTHE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tYeah, but she had divine guidance.\n\n\tWe now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.\n\tHALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking\n\tyoung woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.\n\tappears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,\n\tthirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of\n\tsergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose\n\tsweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear\n\teven smaller and younger than she is.\n\n\tRUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior\n\tin authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored\n\tand laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his\n\tbelt.\n\n\tM.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,\n\tAND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tI'd feel a whole lot safer with\n\t\tSister Loretta for my backup.  Look\n\t\tat this guy: you shredded him!\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tWell, he's dead, he can't hurt me\n\t\tnow.\n\n\tThe target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back \n\tto shooting position.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tIt's sloppy shooting.  It's in\n\t\tcharacter, Ruben, but unnecessary.\n\t\tAnd bad for your career.\n\n\tRUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the\n\tcircle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tI've been practicing.  Now can I\n\t\tkiss your tummy?\n\n\tM.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tPerp's holding a hostage, the\n\t\tshoulder on his gun hand is gonna\n\t\tbe exposed.\n\n\tSOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her\n\tfire.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tAnswer it.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tI'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't\n\t\tyou at least interested in which\n\t\tone it is?\n\n\tShe's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he\n\tanswers, she raises her gun and aims...\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tI'm here, where are you?...\n\t\tHeeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On\n\t\tduty, have to call you back... You,\n\t\ttoo, you too.  My God, you made my\n\t\tday.\n\n\tHe hits the \"end\" button...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tYou hit the brachial nerve...\n\n\tSHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,\n\tinside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY\n\tIN THE MIDDLE!\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tYou're good enough you'll never\n\t\thave to kill anyone.  I joined the\n\t\tcops to save lives, not waste them.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tYou know, M.J., when I watch you\n\t\tshoot, I realize I've got a little\n\t\tproblem with my stance... could you\n\t\tjust move over here and critique my\n\t\tlegs?\n\n\tHe slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.\n\tShe is unloading her weapon...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tThe problem is between your legs.\n\t\tYou told your shrink about that?\n\n\tShe is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tI tell my shrink about you,\n\t\tSergeant.  I tell him you're the\n\t\ttop cop of my dreams.\n\n\tRuben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which\n\the has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks\n\tone up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(putting away her\n\t\t\t gear)\n\t\tDon't take that mess in the car.\n\n\tThey're on the move; as they go away from us...\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tHe's in love with you already...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY\n\n\tThey pull up in front of an apartment building in the\n\tPacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the\n\tthick yellow ticker tape \"POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS\"\n\tis already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.\n\tA couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN\n\tSCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay\n\tM.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tOh, Christ, the Mouth is already\n\t\there.\n\n\tShe is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak\n\tof a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tHey.

Talk to you\n\t\tlater...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(as they escape behind the\n\t\t\t barrier tape)\n\t\tWhat the hell does she want to do,\n\t\tscare everybody to death?\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tThat's her job... Jesus, Quinn is\n\t\there already.\n\n\tQUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide\n\tstands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.\n\tAs they climb up toward him...\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINN\n\t\tI been waiting... I have to do\n\t\teverything myself.  Photo, crime\n\t\ttech, the Coroner are already\n\t\tinside.  The Landlady calls it in;\n\t\ttenant is not answering when\n\t\tcalled, she sticks her head in,\n\t\tsees the body, uses the deceased's\n\t\ttelephone to call 911.  Otherwise\n\t\tnothing disturbed.  It's all yours,\n\t\tkid.  I'll take care of the Mouth\n\t\tand the Haircut.\n\n\tM.J. and Ruben enter...\n\n\tINT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY\n\n\tFour uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;\n\tat the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman\n\tchain-smoking (the Landlady).\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(to cop)\n\t\tThat the Landlady?\n\t\t\t(to Ruben)\n\t\tYou wanna talk to her, Ruben?\n\t\t\t(back to cops)\n\t\tWho was first on the scene?\n\n\tMike answers her question by answering to Ruben!\n\n\t\t\t\tMIKE\n\t\tI was.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(forcefully)\n\t\tI'm over here?

BATHROOM - DAY\n\n\tThe same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair\n\tstill in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and\n\tpushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one\n\tleg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is\n\tslightly posed, but casual, relaxed.\n\n\tBending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE\n\tMEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.\n\n\tM.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.\n\tForeground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is\n\tfinishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's\n\tmen wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between\n\tthem; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the\n\tbody.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO\n\tTHE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  \n\t\n\tON M.J.:\n\t\n\t\t\t\tDOC (V.O.)\n\t\tLiver and rigor are telling me\n\t\tabout eight hours.  I'm gonna take\n\t\ther out now if it's alright.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tI'm seeing ligature marks on her\n\t\tneck here, petechial hemorrhages in\n\t\ther eyes.

TV features the antics of a\n\tnervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.\n\n\tCLOSE UP HELEN:\n\n\tWe hear a faint but impatient voice call:\n\n\t\t\t\tV.O.\n\t\tPeter... Peter...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCROSS FADE TO:\n\n\tINT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT\n\n\tDim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not\n\tcomfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.\n\tShe is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks\n\tolder.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE\n\tDOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and\n\tvideo, on which a movie's final credits are running.\n\n\tTHE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON\n\n\tPETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.\n\tBoyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near\n\this hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts\n\tthe tape on 'eject.'\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tPut in the Kevin Costner.\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tWhy don't we save it for later?\n\t\tIt's almost time for Letterman.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tYou know I don't like to watch talk\n\t\tshows by myself.  Where're you?\n\n\tHe inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he\n\tapproaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a\n\tlock of hair back from the forehead.\n\n\tShe ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE\n\tDOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tSee, now you've annoyed her.  You\n\t\tknow she doesn't like you to touch\n\t\tme.\n\t\t\t(to dog)\n\t\tDoes she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve\n\t\tyou so much!\n\t\t\t(to Peter)\n\t\tDid you feed her?\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tYes, I fed her.  If she says she's\n\t\thungry, she's lying to you.  Again.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tShe doesn't lie!  You sure you fed\n\t\ther?\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tShe lies all the time.  Why would I\n\t\tsay I fed her if I didn't?\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tThat's what I don't know.  Why\n\t\twould you lie?  That's the\n\t\tproblem... I can't understand why\n\t\tanyone would lie.\n\n\tHe leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking\n\tto her dog over the TV soundtrack.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN (cont'd)\n\t\tYou wouldn't lie to Mummy, would\n\t\tyou?  Just to get Dad in trouble?\n\t\tSuch a naughty widdle dog...\n\n\tHER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a\n\tsmall, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,\n\tthen through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the\n\tbasement door behind him.\n\n\tTHE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets\n\tand computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a\n\tsmall TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,\n\tfreeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an\n\toutdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.\n\n\tPETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over\n\tsomething to turn the video back on.\n\n\tThe CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is\n\tthe YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a\n\ttable, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,\n\tbut not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being\n\tasphyxiated by slow degrees.\n\n\tPETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to\n\trepeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made\n\ttoward his wife.  He whispers:\n\n\t\t\t\tPETER\n\t\tDidn't I promise I'd come right\n\t\tback?\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tEXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN\n\n\tALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of\n\tglorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves\n\tdown, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom\n\tof the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A\n\tfew festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new\n\tCRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a\n\tnumber of unmarked cars.\n\n\tRUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.\n\n\tAs he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH\n\tTHE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S\n\tstubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns\n\taway.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tUp all night with a sick friend.\n\n\tNIKKO'S face is tight with anger.\n\n\t\t\t\tNIKKO\n\t\tYou dumb son of a bitch!  You don't\n\t\teven know how to treat a woman.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tWho?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to\n\t\tme why she gave you the boot...\n\n\tHe moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE\n\tWOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is\n\tnow tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath\n\ta sign that says \"NO DUMPING\".  The usual technicians,\n\tphotographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tIs Niccoletti assigned here?\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(angry about it)\n\t\tQuinn decided we should form a task\n\t\tforce -- they're all one case, now.\n\t\tHe wants all the senior detectives\n\t\ton it...\n\t\t\t(to Doc)\n\t\tShe wasn't killed here.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOC\n\t\tNot likely.\n\n\tM.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels\n\tbeside her... to Ruben...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tTell me what you see.\n\n\tHe inspects the dead girl's fingernails.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tShe didn't fight back, no hair or\n\t\tskin under her fingernails.  I'm\n\t\tnot seeing any bruises or\n\t\tcontusions...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tWhat about her arms?\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tNeedle marks, fresh, here.  look at\n\t\tthis...\n\n\tNikko appears, looming over her...\n\n\t\t\t\tNIKKO\n\t\tProbably so stoned she never knew\n\t\twhat got her.  Like Goetz's sick\n\t\tfriend.  Right Goetz?\n\n\tThey ignore him.  M.J. stands...\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tShe's blue as hell.  No marks on her\n\t\tneck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --\n\t\tno ligature marks.  Outdoors...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tLook at her legs.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tSpread out like she was sexually\n\t\tassaulted here.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOC\n\t\tAfter she was dead.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tShe was dragged up here from the\n\t\troad, you can see the tracks.  She\n\t\twas already dead or unconscious.\n\t\tLet's get plaster casts on any --\n\t\tall footprints.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tIf this is just the dump site,\n\t\twhere did he do the job?  Where did\n\t\the pick her up?\n\n\t\t\t\tNIKKO\n\t\tDoped up kids all over town.  Park\n\t\twas full of them last night.  Very\n\t\teasy pickin'.  Goetz's type.\n\n\tRuben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes\n\tRuben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between\n\tthem.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tWhat the hell are you doing?  The\n\t\tMouth and the Haircut are right\n\t\tdown there, thank God they didn't\n\t\tsee that.\n\n\tDown below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-\n\tof-Lovers.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tNiccoletti, they're on the wrong\n\t\tside of the tape, you want to push\n\t\tthem back?  Now.\n\n\tNikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for\n\tRUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow\n\ther back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the\n\thillside to their cars...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tRuben, my God, I ought to put you\n\t\ton report.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tYou're right.  I can't stand that\n\t\tbastard.  Sorry.\n\t\t\t(getting back to\n\t\t\t work)\n\t\tThis is something new.  Not the\n\t\tsame guy, that's for sure.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tYeah, everything's different.\n\n\tBut she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tGet the pictures, and casts of\n\t\tfootprints.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tLook at him, grandstanding...\n\n\tNikko is talking to Susan Schiff...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tThat's all we need...\n\n\tShe strides toward them...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tDetective Niccoletti?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSAN\n\t\tWhat's this about the Boston\n\t\tStrangler, M.J.?\n\n\tM.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also\n\tthinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at\n\tthis point -- or not?\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tHey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on\n\t\tthe wrong side of the tape.  We're\n\t\tstill trying to find any footprints\n\t\tor tire marks and we don't want to\n\t\tchew up the ground, okay?  I'll\n\t\ttalk to you later.\n\t\t\t(to Nikko)\n\t\tYou, too.\n\n\tShe's got Susan outside the tape...\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSAN\n\t\tInspector, will you confirm\n\t\tsomebody is copying the Boston\n\t\tStrangler?  This is the fourth, is\n\t\tthat correct?\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tWe're going to review all the\n\t\tevidence carefully before making\n\t\tany statement...\n\n\tShe is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other\n\tside.  Susan races for her silver Audi...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tRuben, put the light on...\n\n\tFrom outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm\n\tclap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.\n\n\tM.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster\n\tcar, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,\n\ttrolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the\n\tfamiliar San Francisco chase scenes.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tNow listen up, Ruben.  You never,\n\t\tnever, never mess with somebody\n\t\tinside the case!\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tExcuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do\n\t\tyou...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tYou damn well better start working\n\t\ton that impulse control.  A woman\n\t\twho is implicated in this case?\n\t\tSomeone who's practically a piece\n\t\tof evidence?\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tIt's against your rules that I try\n\t\tto help a witness who's scared\n\t\tshitless?  Who's...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tThe woman's unstable.  You could\n\t\twind up with a harassment charge.\n\t\tAnything.  You're like some horny\n\t\tlittle teenager.\n\n\tM.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view\n\tmirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she\n\ttries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tAnybody who's ever watched TV knows\n\t\tabout that corner.\n\n\tHaving lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tEverybody could see you -- unshaved,\n\t\tsame clothes from yesterday,\n\t\treeking of sex.\n\n\tRUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot\n\tand jumps out.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(going away)\n\t\tPark the car.  Call the lab.  Get\n\t\tDoc to lean on the coroner for a\n\t\treally fast prelim on the sperm.\n\n\tRUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J. (O.S.)\n\t\tWhen you get it, call me.\n\n\tRUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tRUBEN\n\t\tShe loves me.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT.

AS:\n\n\tTHERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS\n\tEXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.\n\n\tTHE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED\n\tSWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION\n\tGRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND\n\tSHADOWS.\n\n\tOUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J. & HELEN\n\t\tNo!!\n\n\tPETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN\n\tSCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...\n\n\tA PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT\n\tTEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.\n\n\tSWAT TEAM\n\n\tLIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.\n\n\tPETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND\n\tSLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\n\tINT. AUDITORIUM - LATER\n\n\tM.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE\n\tBULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tJesus that hurts.  You think the\n\t\trib is busted?\n\n\t\t\t\tPARAMEDIC\n\t\tThat looks like just a bad bruise.\n\t\tI'll tape it up if you want to...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tI'll take some Tylenol and codeine,\n\t\tinstead, how about a lot of number\n\t\tsix?\n\n\tThe medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around\n\tthem.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on\n\ther shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(it hurts)\n\t\tOh, God.\n\n\tSAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND\n\tLIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun\n\tand hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she\n\tmisunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her\n\tresignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of\n\tofficer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE\n\tAS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINN\n\t\tI'll take it, kid.  You take two\n\t\tweeks paid leave.  Don't waste a\n\t\tsecond thinking about that shitbag.\n\t\tThen come back.  You're a cop, M.J.\n\n\tHe nods to Helen...\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINN (cont'd)\n\t\tGet the civilians outta here.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tShe's in no shape to give her\n\t\tstatement tonight...\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINN\n\t\tNo, she can come in tomorrow...\n\t\tgonna want to know a lot of\n\t\tthings...\n\n\tB.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING\n\tHIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage\n\tand lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past\n\tthem, as...\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tThe only one who could tell you\n\t\twhat you really need to know is\n\t\tdead.\n\n\t\t\t\tQUINN\n\t\tYeah, it's a thought...\n\n\tOf no importance to him, he turns away...\n\n\tINT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\n\tIn the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big\n\texterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion\n\tgrenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus\n\tunder the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and\n\tHELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...\n\n\tTHE AUDITORIUM (POV).\n\n\tThe cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a\n\tsmall door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...\n\n\tEXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT\n\n\tIt is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the\n\tcorner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA\n\tCIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.\n\tM.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.\n\tSHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK\n\tAWAY...\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\tYou could use a long hot bath, you\n\t\tknow that?  You better get somebody\n\t\tto drive you home.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tWhy can't I drive home?  I will.\n\t\tYou.  Look at you.  You need a ride\n\t\thome.  And you don't even know it.\n\n\t\t\t\tM.J.\n\t\t\t(beat)\n\t\tWell, thanks.\n\n\tThe two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside\n\tthe circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL\n\tSHOT.\n\n\tTHE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSAN\n\t\tHey!  Halloran!  What's the story\n\t\there?\n\n\tOn the two women getting in the car...\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tIf she has to ask, she's never\n\t\tgonna know.\n\n\tHIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE\n\tNIGHT.\n\n\t\t\t\tTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopycat\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Frank Pierson\u00a0\u00a0Ann Biderman\u00a0\u00a0Jay Presson Allen\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Mystery\u00a0\u00a0Thriller\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:23:00.780150"}
