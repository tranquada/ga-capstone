LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY\n</b>\n\tThe hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is\n\tspeaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is\n\ta projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,\n\tFANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and\n\tTRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser\n\tpointing device.  We see her from a considerable\n\tdistance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and\n\tassured.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tOur society creates these socially\n\t\tand psychically disenfranchised\n\t\tmen, and their revenge on society\n\t\tis terrible.  They are hard to\n\t\tcatch.  They are \"the nice guy next\n\t\tdoor,\" their employers -- if they\n\t\twork at all -- find them quiet and\n\t\tuncomplaining.  Early abuse and\n\t\trejection have taught them\n\t\tpassivity.  Only in their violent\n\t\tfantasies do they feel alive.  What\n\t\tthey seek in their frenzied\n\t\tassaults on their victims is relief\n\t\tfrom passivity.  For these men, ten\n\t\tminutes relief is worth far more\n\t\tthan the life of another human\n\t\tbeing.  Torture, the pain they\n\t\tinflict, the screams of the victim,\n\t\tare all part of the ritual that\n\t\tgives them a brief respite from\n\t\ttheir own psychic pain.  And then\n\t\tthe depression, the forgetting, the\n\t\tfeeling of sadness and despair\n\t\tbegins the cycle all over again.\n\t\tLike addicts seeking their drug,\n\t\tAlbert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,\n\t\tBerkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they\n\t\tseek out their next victim.\n\n\tDuring the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera\n\thas moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the\n\tbalcony railing.\n\n<b>\tCLOSEUP: HELEN\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tThe cycle is endless until they are\n\t\tcaught.  And they are caught by\n\t\tchance -- they run a red light, and\n\t\ta body is in the trunk.  A leaking\t\n\t\tpipe brings a plumber to a basement\n\t\twhere they is the smell of death.\n\n\tHer eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in\n\tthe balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.\n\n<b>\tHELEN'S POV:\n</b>\n\tSitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED\n\tMAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed\n\tarms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.\n\n\tHELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:\n\n\tBackstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly\n\talert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of\n\texposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the\n\twings on the other side of the stage, also springs to\n\tattention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...\n\n\tTheir POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer\n\tthere.\n\n\tHELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tAt any time, right now, as you\n\t\tlisten, the FBI estimates there are\n\t\t30 to 35 serial killers stalking\n\t\ttheir victims.  The serial killer is\n\t\ta plaque that must be addressed not\n\t\tonly by the law, but by science.\n\t\tFlorida spent eight million dollars\n\t\tto execute Ted Bundy.  It would\n\t\thave been better spent building a\n\t\tforensic penal facility devoted to\n\t\tresearch.\n\n\tOnce again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself\n\tthat the smiling man is not there...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tConfined for life, without parole,\n\t\tand subjected to scientific study,\n\t\tthese men's lives might finally, in\n\t\tsome small measure, educate and\n\t\tthereby protect society.  Thank\n\t\tyou.\n\n\tApplause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are\n\tcarefully casing the crowd.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tLATER:\n</b>\n\tThe crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the\n\tladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes \n\tas well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE\n<b>\tTHROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO\n</b><b>\tDRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY\n</b>\n\tTHE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks\n\taround.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He\n\thastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.\n\tBefore the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to\n\tstand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the\n\thigh heels to a stall several doors down.\n\n<b>\tCLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:\n</b>\n\tAnd a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the\n\tankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from\n\tview as\n\n\tHELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper\n\taround the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise\n\tmakes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is\n\tjust able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES\n<b>\tDOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.\n</b>\n\tLike a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently\n\tyanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.\n\n\tCORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears\n\tthe clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He\n\treacts...\n\n<b>\tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED\n</b>\n\tThe RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a\n\thook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)\n\n\t\t\t\tCOP (o.s.)\n\t\tDoctor Hudson?  Are you okay in\n\t\tthere?\n\n\tThe MAN lets slip a little slack.\n\n\tHELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,\n\tget just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little\n\tscream.\n\n\tCORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous\n\tsounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for\n\ta split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now\n\tthere is more SOUND from inside...\n\n<b>\tINT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tCOP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder\n\twe see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at\n\ther throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the\n\ttoilet seat.\n\n\tCOP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we\n\tsee a broom closet door opening.\n\n\tHELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a\n\tsecond, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,\n\this gun still in his hand.\n\n\tRED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at\n<b>\tHELEN.\n</b>\n\tCOP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions\n\tin his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,\n\tthe sound reverberating against the tile walls.\n\n<b>\tSTAGE AREA\n</b>\n\tThe audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.\n\tHELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSLAM CUT:\n</b>\n<b>\tINT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT\n</b>\n\tAs HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try\n\tdesperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now\n\tpale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her\n\teyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tAndy!  Andy!\n\n\tShe races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT\n\tFEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a\n\thall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...\n\n<b>\tINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tThe room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it\n\tis used on and off by her computer, Andy.)\n\n\tHELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO\n\tHERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,\n\twhere she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)\n\tThe sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm\n\therself with the sound of her own voice...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tIt is October twelfth, 1994 in the\n\t\tcity of San Francisco, California,\n\t\tU.S.A., the strongest, richest,\n\t\tmost stable and happiest country in\n\t\tthe world.  That is the sole place\n\t\tof life in the universe.  Under\n\t\tGod.\n\n\tCLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,\n\tothers scattering from the nervous haste...\n\n\tCLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she\n\ttosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard\n\treflection with a certain detachment...\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\tGood God.

And moves into her OFFICE.\n\tShe pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.\n\tOf the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The\n\tother shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the\n\tscreen comes a command.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHESSMASTER\n</b>\t\t'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam\n\t\tmove.'\n\n\tShe studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a\n\tmove.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other\n\tcomputer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tCHESSMASTER\n</b>\t\t'Lousy move.  Not really into this\n\t\tgame, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've\n\t\tgot a feeling about you.  Let's\n\t\tmeet.  Like a date.'\n\n\tHELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHELEN\n</b>\t\t'I'm a terrible date.

Come on, move.'\n\n\tShe pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window\n\tcurtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the\n\tT-shirt HELEN wears says \"Shrinks 'R' Us.\"  She crosses to\n\tthe window with her glass of cognac, looks out.\n\n<b>\tVIEW:\n</b>\n\tA sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The\n\tmorning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.\n\tHELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to <u>feel</u> the\n\tair, the freedom.

M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking\n\tyoung woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.\n\tappears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,\n\tthirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of\n\tsergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose\n\tsweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear\n\teven smaller and younger than she is.\n\n\tRUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior\n\tin authority to M.J.

The door is locked.\n\tFrantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.\n\n<b>\tHER POV:\n</b>\n\tRUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just\n\tturning down the stairs and is gone...

Then he picks HELEN up and\n\tcarries her back into her apartment.\n\n<b>\tINT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\n\tRUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw\n\tup over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it\n\tto her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer\n\twater, then watches her take the pills.

A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.\n\tShe is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks\n\tolder.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE\n\tDOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and\n\tvideo, on which a movie's final credits are running.\n\n<b>\tTHE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON\n</b>\n\tPETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.\n\tBoyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near\n\this hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.

He locks the\n\tbasement door behind him.\n\n\tTHE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets\n\tand computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a\n\tsmall TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,\n\tfreeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an\n\toutdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.\n\n\tPETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over\n\tsomething to turn the video back on.\n\n\tThe CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is\n\tthe YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a\n\ttable, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,\n\tbut not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being\n\tasphyxiated by slow degrees.\n\n\tPETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to\n\trepeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made\n\ttoward his wife.
