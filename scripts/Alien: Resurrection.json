DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK.\n</b>\nWe sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes \ninto view:\n\nthe U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically \njust beyond Pluto's orbit.\n\nWe TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and \n\n<b>INT.  AURIGA\n</b>\nalong the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two \nguards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful \nshockrifles, expressions empty and cold.\n\n<b>INT.  MEDLAB\n</b>\nAlong a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, \nlights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. \n\nAs we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, \nthen another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a \nCryogenic tube, not big enough for a human.\n\nStill TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass \nencased in a clear, aspic-like gel. \n\nTubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine.\n\nAs we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can \nsee what might even be a face.\n\nEyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming.\n\n<b>ANGLE: WHEAT.\n</b>\nA birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen.  \nSharp contrast to what we have seen before.\n\nThere is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven \nor eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair.\n\n<b>GIRL'S VOICE\n</b>\nMy mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there \nare.\n\nThe girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her \nchest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see.\n\nShe looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty \nyards away.\n\nThe girl's expression becomes perplexed.\n\nShe slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, \nwriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more \ndistraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout.\n\nThe sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another.  \nShe looks down in  growing horror and sees:\n\nBlood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, \na sea of blood now, dark, thick.\n\nThe girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely \ncovered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she \nfinally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  LAB\n</b>\nInstruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure.\n\nScientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic.\n\nWe can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the \nsize of a man, and in a new case.\n\nThe camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a \nsecond one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. HALLLWAY\n</b>\nTiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning \ninto another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving \nuntil we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of \ndark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us...\n\nANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream \nit keeps shifting.\n\nShe opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless.\n\nShe reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard.\n\nTearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  OPERATING CHAMBER\n</b>\nAnd the cause of this dream becomes apparant:\n\n<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST\n</b>\nbeing cut open with a lasersaw.\n\nWe see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it.  \nAnd her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her \nface her identity is unmistakable.\n\nAround her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a \nyoung and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands \na bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nCareful ... ready with the amnio...\n\nGediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it.  \nPulls apart the chest.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nThere she is...\n\nHe says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a \nsleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at \nsevering umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nHere we go.\n\nHe holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator \nfilled with  amniotic fluid.\n\nThe alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of \nhis grasp.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nWatch it!\n\nEverybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from \nhim, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the \ntop rapidly.\n\nEverybody looks at each other for a moment.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nWell ...\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThe host?\n\nA surgeon looks at Ripley's readings.\n\n<b>SURGEON\n</b>\nDoing fine.\n\nGediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nSew her back up.\n\nGediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the \nalien.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nWell, that went as well as could be expected--\n\nRipley's hand LASHES OUT, GRABS the surgeon's forearm.  He yells in \npain as her fingers dig into him, the others scramble knocking things \nover and we HEAR HIS BONE CRACKING.\n\n<b>SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. RIPLEY'S CELL\n</b>\nSudden stillness.\n\nRipley crouches in the middle of a small, dark chamber.  She's wide \neyed, staring straight ahead in a state of near catatonia. Hair tangled \nand wild. But at least she's not so  blue as before.\n\nThe only light on her comes from directly above, from a thick pane of \nglass in the center of the ceiling.\n\n<b>ANGLE: ABOVE THE CELL\n</b>\nA guard stands on the floor above, looking into the cell through the \nsquare of glass in  the floor, directly above Ripley.\n\n(We see other panes of glass lining the floor, indicating more cells \nbelow.)\n\n<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY\n</b>\nShe is still for a long while.  Then she lifts her hands, looking at \nthem.\n\nTouches her face, her skin.\n\nShe fingers her tunic, pulls down the neck.  There is a scar running \nalong her chest.\n\nShe fingers it thoughtfully. -\n\nShe looks at her forearm.  Tattooed near the crook of her elbow is the \nnumber 8.\n\nShe looks up, her face unreadable.\n\n<b>CUT TO':\n</b>\n<b>INT.  LAB\n</b>\nRipley is sitting on a table as Gediman draws blood from her.\n\nHe deposits it in a test beaker, studies her eyes.\n\nWren enters, looking at a chart.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nHow's our number Eight today?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN:\n</b>\nAppears to be in good health...\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\n(noticing his tone)\n\nHow good?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nExtraordinary. As in, completely off our projected charts.\n\n(shows him some photos) Look at the scar tissue.  See the recession?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThis is from --\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nYesterday!\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThis is good.  This is very good.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nI'd like to run some tests: strength, coordination...  We're not \nlooking at a normal cloning arc.\n\n<b>WREN:\n</b>\nApproved.\n\nWren goes up to Ripley, studies her face with satisfaction.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nWell, it looks like you're going to make us all very proud.\n\nShe grabs his throat with dazzling speed, applying deadly pressure as \nshe  brings his face to hers.  Her eyes are burn but lost.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nWhy?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nOh my God...\n\nHe is as wide eyed as WREN, and he isn't having his windpipe crushed.\n\nAfter a moment the shock wears off and he slams his hand into the \nalarm.\n\nKlaxons, red light fire up.\n\nA guard rushes in, levels his weapon at Ripley.  After a moment of \nstaring him down, she opens her hand.  Wren falls to his knees gasping.\n\nThe guard FIRES his rifle at her -- a powerful electrical charge lashes \nout and sends her flying back into the corner.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nNo! No! I'm all right!\n\nThe guards keep their weapons -- 'burners', these shockrifles are \ncalled -- leveled  at Ripley. She has recovered from the shock quickly, \nsits crumpled in the corner, looking at nothing in particular.\n\nRIPLEY (wearily)\n\nWhy...?\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM\n</b>\nWren and Gediman watch through a one way mirror as a scientist tests \nRipley.\n\nWith them is General PEREZ, the man in charge this boat. Ramrod \nstraight and about  as gruff as you would expect, he stares at Ripley \nsuspiciously.\n\n<b>ANGLE: RIPLEY\n</b>\nThe scientist is holding up cards with pictures on them: house, dog, \nboat.\n\nRipley gives answers we can't hear through the glass, looking pissed \noff and bored.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nIt's unprecedented.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nTotally!  She's operating at a completely adult capacity.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nAnd her memories?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThere are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nShe's freaked.\n\nWren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\n\"It\" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional \nautism.\n\nCertain reactions....\n\nPerez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall.\n\n<b>TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT HALL - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nThe two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second \nobservation room.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN:\n</b>\nBut the thing is, we can't terminate her. It.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nYou haven't told me what you think has caused this.\n\nCloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought \nto adult term.  I'm right?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nThere's been cases..\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nNot like this.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nWell, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a \ncollective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like \ninstinct, only  more complex structurally.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nIn some cases. You're talking about the alien.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nYes.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nYou promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nIt's not like the other ones..\n\nPerez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second \nobservation room door opens..\t\n\nHe steps in, the other two right behind him.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO\n</b>\nDarker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards \nby the door.\n\nApart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nBut there is some genetic mix.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nYes.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nWill there be further mutation?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nMutation isn't exactly... I don't think so.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThat's one of the things we need to study.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nAll right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for \nGod's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises.\n\nAnd as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the \nridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at \nthe back of his head.\n\nThe reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, \nstops it.\n\nAs it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the \nalien's face.\n\nIts bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off.\n\nPerez turns to look at it with the others.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nIt took a hell of a lot to get us here.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nNo shit.\n\nWren shoots him another look.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nHow soon before this one's ovulating?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nDays.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nIs that normal?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nNo way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated.\n\n(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies.\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nThey're coming.  Soon.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT. MESS HALL\n</b>\nRipley sits across from Gediman. He is eating at a good pace - Ripley, \nhowever, has stopped.  She is staring at her fork, her brows furrowed.  \nTurns it over in her hand, in her mind.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\n\"Fork.\"\n\nThe memory comes, and she shakes her head wearily.\n\nRIPLEY (softly)\n\nFuck....\n\nGEDIMAN (pretending to correct her)\n\n\"Fork.\"\n\nEver so slightly, she smiles. The smile fades, and after a moment:\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nHow did you...\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nHow did we get you?  Blood samples from Fiori 16. On ice. \n\nDo you remember that place?\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nDoes it grow?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nDoes it.....Yeah. Rapidly.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nIt's a queen.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nHow did you know that?\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nIt'll breed.  You'll die.  Everyone in the ... fucking.... (searches \nfor the word, then spits it out) ... Company.  Will die.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nCompany?\n\n<b>WREN (O.S.)\n</b>\nWeyland Yutani.\n\nHe has entered behind her, comes up to the table.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nOur Ripley's former employers.  Terran Growth conglom, had some defense \ncontracts  under the military. Before your time, Gediman -- they went \nunder decades ago, bought out by Walmart.  Fortunes of war.\n\n(to Ripley)\n\nYou'll find things have changed a good deal since your time.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\n1 doubt that.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nWe're not flying blind here, you know.  This is United Systems \nmilitary, not some greedy corporation. The potential benefits of this \nrace go way beyond urban pacification.\n\nNew alloys, new vaccines ... there's nothing like this in any world \nwe've seen.  \n\nYou should be very proud.\n\nShe laughs, bitterly.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nOh, I am.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nAnd the animal itself is wonderous. They'll be invaluable once we've \nharnessed them.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nIt's a cancer.  You can't teach it tricks.\n\nThis stops Wren, and he retreats silently.  Ripley repeats word to \nherself, thinking.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\n\"Them\" ...\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  HALL   CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nAs Wren is leaving the mess, he is accosted by an ensign.\n\n<b>ENSIGN\n</b>\nDoctor, General Perez is asking for you. We've been hailed.\n\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>EXT.  DEEP SPACE\n</b>\nWe see the Auriga far in the distance Suddenly A SHIP ROARS INTO FRAME, \nheading for it.  \n\nA small vessel, it is every bit dirty and jerry-rigged as the Auriga is \npristine.  \n\nTo accentuate the difference, the sudden roar of its engines is \naccompanied by \n\n<b>HEAVY, THRASHING ROCK MUSIC.\n</b>\n<b>CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>INT.  COCKPIT    CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nThe music is coming from nearby.  Piloting the ship toward the Auriga \nis HILLARD, a roughskinned woman in her forties, along with RANE, a \nslight and quiet fellow.\n\nBehind them stands ELGYN, the leader of the group.\n\nHas the kind of authority that doesn't need to flaunt itself.\n\nMaybe fifty, by the silver in his hair. He speaks into the vidcom\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\n(good naturedly)\n\nMy authorization code is 'fuck you', son.  Now open the goddamn bay or \nGeneral Perez  is gonna do a Wichita stomp on your virgin ass.\n\nHe switches off.\n\n<b>RANE\n</b>\nWichita stomp?\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nI guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman.\n\n(to Hillard)\n\nBring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel.\n\n<b>HILLARD\n</b>\nDarlin', it's done.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nDon't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright.\n\nHe puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he \nexits.\n\nThey're more than friends.\n\nHe moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nChristie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking.\n\nHe proceeds into:\n\n<b>INT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS\n</b>\nIt's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most \nof the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly \nthe size of winnebagos.\n\nAs Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of \nthem.\n\nShe's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth \nand prettiness.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nCall!  CALL!\n\nThe music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner.  \n\nElgyn switches it off.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nCall!\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nWhat?\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nWe're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured?\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nI checked 'em an hour ago.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nI don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your \nhide.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nTrust me, boss.\n\nELGYN (laughs)\n\nNot my style.\n\nHe leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel \ndolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late \nforties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nHow's it looking?\n\nVRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a \ntotal fucking write-off.\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nYou'll make it good.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nDon't be so sure.\n\n(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs!\n\nELGYN (straightening up)\n\nThey just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far.\n\nHe exits.\n\n<b>CUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS\n</b>\nCHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has \ndistinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me \nauthority.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nWhat's our status?\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nWe're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality.\n\n<b>ST JUST\n</b>\nOh great.  Army food..\n\nST JUST (\"San-Jhoost\") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool.  \n\nMoves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is \nstrapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer \nholder, but a very complex one.\n\nELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get \nthose harvesters on their feet.\n\nThis'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are \nfriendly.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nWe expecting any trouble?\n\n<b>ELGYN\n</b>\nFrom Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant.\n\n<b>CUT TO: INT.

You son of a whore!\n\nJOHNER jumps down from the machine, laughing.  He's thickset, mean and \nugly, with ugly scars crisscrossing his ugly bald head.\n\nThought I'd give you a little haircut there.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nYou fuck!\n\nCall, who has been over on the other side of the thresher, ably climbs \nup on it  and switches it off.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nYou should see your face.

You hang with us a while, you'll learn \nI'm not the man with whom to fuck.\n\nHe exits, full of annoying bravado.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nThat inbred cocksucker.\n\nHe feels his forehead, comes up with a bit of blood.  Realizes how \nclose it was ...\n\nCall looks up at the thresher.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\n1 hate machines.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nWell, now we know it works ...\n\n<b>CUT TO: EXT.  AURIGA DOCKING BAY\n</b>\nAs it opens to admit the proportionally tiny ship.  The bay on the \nbottom of the Auriga \n\n- the doors are actually OVER the ship, which rises into the airlock.\n\n<b>INT.  AIR LOCK\n</b>\nThe outer doors close under the ship.  Pressurized air shoot into the \nairlock for a few seconds, and then the inner door opens. the ship \nrising into the bay.\n\n<b>INT.  BAY\n</b>\nThe ship moves slowly along the huge dock to land gently at far end.  \nThe top of  the ship is nearly level with a grated platform that runs \nthe length of the bay.\n\nThree soldiers in full armour stand rigid on the platform. The hatch \natop the ship slowly  opens. One by one the crew files out. Seeing them \nen masse, we get a clearer view of  what separates them from this \nEnvironment.  They're not wearing uniforms.  They're an  eclectic, \nfiercely indivualist group, their look varied -- spots of bright color \nshowing  through militarian space gear.  Johner's bright tuorquise \nbowling shirt.  Elgy's and St Just's floorlength leather dusters.  Even \nVriess's chair stands out as he wheels down the platform.\n\nWhat they have in common is the toughness, the wary eyes, leathery \nskin.  The cool readiness to kill.  These guys are smugglers.  A long \nwhile ago, you'd have called them pirates\n\nAll eight of them emerge, one by one, looking around them.  They file \npast the silent, uniformed soldiers.  The last one suddenly puts a hand \non Johner's jacket, stops him.\n\nThere is a bulge under it.  A green sensor light on the back of the \nsoldier's glove turns  red when he touches the bulge.\n\n<b>SOLDIER\n</b>\nNo projectile weaponry is allowed on board the vessel, sir.\n\nJohner opens his jacket, shows what he's packing: a large thermos.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nMoonshine. My own. Much more dangerous.\n\n<b>SOLDIER\n</b>\nSorry, sir.\n\nELGYN (to Perez)\n\nWhat, do you think we're going to hijack the vessel?  All eight of us?\n\nNo, I think one of your asshole crew is going to get drunk and put a \nbullet through  the hull. we are in space, Elgyn.\n\nHe enters from the antechamber, motions for the crew to follow him. \n\nVriess comes abreast of the soldier.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nWanna check the chair?\n\nThe soldier makes no response, simply falls in behind Call, the last of \nthem.\n\n<b>CUT TO:  INT.

The group \nproceeds down it, the crew looking about them at the sterile grandeur.\n\n<b>ST JUST\n</b>\nThis place is really clean.\n\nJOHNER (to a guard)\n\nHey.  You got any whores on this vessel?\n\n(the guard remains stonefaced)\n\nAny loose women with bad eyesight?\n\n<b>PEREZ\n</b>\nI think you'll find our accomodations somewhat spartan.  Although the \ncook sets a good-table.\n\nJOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for.\n\nVRIESS (to Call)\n\nWhat's the matter?\n\nShe is looking around her, somewhat tensely.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nI don't like army.\n\n<b>HILLARD\n</b>\nYeah, join the fucking club.\n\n<b>CUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY\n</b>\nA stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, \nand identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail \nnapkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills.\n\n<b>WIDER ANGLE: INT.

Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up \nin the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and \nhissing at it. \n\nGediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the \nbeast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue \nissues slowly forth, dripping with slime.\n\nGEDIMAN (softly, fascinated)\n\nIs that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see \nme?\n\nThe creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes.\n\nSomething moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand \ncloses on his shoulder.\n\nIt's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems \nonly mildly surprised.\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nHow did you get in here?\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nBeautiful, aren't they?\n\n<b>GEDIMAN\n</b>\nYes.  Yes they are.

Lightly at first, then deeply - \nholding his head with both hands.

FAST.\n\nVriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly \ncompared to the beast.\n\nHe turns the corner, spins around.\n\nThe hall is fifty feet long.  At the far end a few soldiers running \nthrough.\n\n<b>SERGEANT\n</b>\nSeal off that sector!\n\nA soldier runs to obey, working the door controls.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nNo!\n\nThe soldier sees him, but the fear on the boy's face telegraphs his-\ndecision.\n\nVreiess starts pumping toward the door.  He's strong, picking up speed, \nbut the alien rounds the corner and bolts after him.\n\nVriess can't even look back as the thing gains on him.  The door begins \nto come down, the soldier finishing the sequence and running off.\n\nVriess rolls, face set -- the alien a few feet behind, reaching for him\n\nAn EXPLOSION far away ROCKS THE SHIP -- the hall tilted momentarily, \nVriess gets a  boost as he rockets downhill, the beast still on him, \nthe door closing, too low for him to clear. He gets there and SLAMS a \nlever, his chair FLATTENS out to a dolly  position, his head just \nCLEARS the closing door as the alien SLAMS into it, Vriess spinning out \nand flying off the chair it tilts, landing in a heap next to him.\n\nLying still on the ground, he listens as the beast slams against the \ndoor a few more times, then fades off.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nFuck everything....\n\nHe reaches up for the chair and from the back of it he pulls out a \nshotgun.\n\n<b>CUT TO: INT.

He \nbarely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back \nof his skull.\n\nHillard has time.  She SCREAMS as her lover's brains come out his \nmouth.\n\nThe beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it \nclaws into one of the guards. Everybody else is scrambling for cover.\n\nSt Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes \nout, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a \npipe.\n\nAnother guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him. \nJohner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it.\n\nCall has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls \nto open the door.\n\nIt starts to rise.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nChristie!  Hillard!  Come on!\n\nThe door rises fully.  Ripley stands behind it.\n\nCall starts back, not sure what the woman will do.\n\nRipley surveys the scene.\n\nThe Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops.  \nLooks up.\n\nEveryone watches as the two creatures sense each other.  ThE alien \nhisses. rears back.\n\nRipley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her \nface, but her posture passive, sacrificial.  She does not move.\n\nEveryone watches, too afraid to breathe.\n\nThe alien LUNGES at her, leaping across the room in two bounds. It's on \nher -- and she SPINS, GPABBING IT, and HURLS IT AWAY.\n\nIt lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, \nknocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, \npiston tongue at her face, inches away. \n\nShe locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its \ntendons strain, snap.\n\nCALL (to a guard)\n\nShoot it!  Shoot them both!\n\nShe grabs his gun and BURNS them both.  Two less-than-human SCREAMS \nfill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart.\n\nThe beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley \nagain.\n\nRipley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with \ninhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head.\n\nShe dives at it as it comes out from under....\n\nCall shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's \nmomentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the \nAlien lands with a spine snapping crunch,\n\nRipley only slightly better.\n\nA few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down \nthe spiral staircase to that level.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nWhere are you going?\n\nThe creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying \nstrength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... \nits jaws open, dripping shaking...\n\nThe tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT.\n\nA scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she \nSCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE.\n\nShe stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near.  \nThey watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to \nCall.  Ripley looks a tad pissed.\n\nCall tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well.\n\nRipley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on.\n\nCall looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still \ntwitching.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nWhat the FUCK is going on here?\n\n<b>RANE\n</b>\nWhat was that thing?

CHAMBER/CELLBLOCK - A BIT LATER\n\nThe group is still in the adjoining chamber, but looking here into the \ncellblock where \n\nRipley had been.  DiStephano and St Just come first, guns ready, \nlooking about them.\n\nThey are followed by Christie and Wren.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nThere's a console in the guards, station.  We can punch up a diagnostic \nof the ship and plan a route.  To your ship.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nThat likes me fine.\n\nHe signals for the others to follow, everyone moving cautiously.\n\n<b>ANGLE: HILLARD\n</b>\nGently lays her coat over Elgyn's face. Johner looks down a moment.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nVia con Dios, man.\n\nHillard stands. Call puts ahand on her shoulder but Hillard moves away, \na distrustful look on her face.\n\nRipley, bringing up the rear, watches the whole group with a sort of \nfascinated detatchment.\n\nCall looks back at her.  Ripley smiles, coldly.\n\n<b>ANGLE: IN THE CELLBLOCK\n</b>\nThe group makes their way slowly, quietly.  They approach a bank of \nelevators, but Wren points down an adjoining doorway.  They are about \nto go there when the elevator door lights up, indicating arrival.\n\nThe group backs up, spreads out. Those who can find cover take it. guns \ndrawn.\n\nThe elevator doors open.  It is too dark inside to see:\n\nSuddenly sparks fly from the broken overhead in the elevator and a \nfigure appears in the light.\n\nEveryone jolts, about to fire. before they realize it is\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nWho sits in his chair, a shotgun in each hand, eyes wide. twitchier \nthan they.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nOh, fuck...\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nvriess!\n\nVRIESS (mock casual)\n\nHey, whatchyou guys doing?

Parts of the ship are simply not there, the \nsections around those holes red.  Wren points them out.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nWe've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- \nJesus, right by the engine room.

Not even you.\n\nHer voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nSo what's our route?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nI'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked \non both sides here,\n\nI'm not sure\n\n<b>DISTEPHMO\n</b>\nSir?  There is the lift.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nShow me.\n\nDiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's \nindicating revealed.\n\n<b>DISTEPHMO\n</b>\nThe lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to \nengineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a \nmaintenece access tunnel here\n\n(points to the center of the shaft)\n\nthat runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nSounds reasonable.\n\n<b>DISTEPHANO\n</b>\nI don't have the code for the access tunnel door.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nI can override.\n\n<b>DISTEPHMO\n</b>\n(indicating the route)\n\nThen we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom \nof the shaft.\n\nUp, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free.\n\n<b>ANGLE: VRIESS\n</b>\nIs unloading additional ammo from inside his chair.  He toss one of his \nshotguns to Hillard.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nThey never check the chair...\n\nHe pulls out a grenade launcher.

Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , \nguns drawn.\n\nBringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun..

He looks up.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nThe cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble.\n\n<b>ANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS\n</b>\nWe see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.

The crew move swiftly and \ngracefully down the stairs and into the kitchen.\n\nIn here it's a tad labyrinthian, and the size of the room it darker. \nWren heads straight for the other end.\n\nThey swim.  Safety is a good fifty feet away.\n\nThey are tense, concentrated.  Swimming past dark spaces.  Anything \ncould be hiding here.\n\nJohner looks about him, very nervous.  Dark spaces.  He looks behind.\n\nThree aliens are right behind him.\n\nPanic blows half the air out of his mouth as he swings around and FIRES \nat them, tags one as the other two swim off into shadows with horrible \nease.\n\nRipley, all the way to the stairs, sees.  She hurries the others past \nher.\n\nThey swim frantically for safety, Hillard Wren, Christie and Vriess.\n\nRane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, \npull him into it.\n\nHillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still \nfiring at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot.\n\nCall is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating \nthe surface.\n\nShe is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB.\n\nA net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the \nsurface.\n\nCall struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as \nWren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear \nthrough it, but they are getting weaker.\n\nRipley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close \nbehind.\n\nShe looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface \n-- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running \nout of air KICKS at it, it  lets go.\n\nThe others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but \nit's tough, she  still can't get her head up --\n\n--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful \nof water and begins thrashing.\n\nRipley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart \nwith a mighty heave, she glides up through --\n\n<b>CLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE\n</b>\nJust BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER \n<b>CLAMPS DOWN ON HER.\n</b>\nRipley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the \nsurface.\n\nWren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in \nfour shots.\n\nChristie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, \nin a circular sweep.\n\nThey decimate a number of eggs\n\n<b>ANGLE: UNDERWATER\n</b>\nRipley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its \nfingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint.  \nWorse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing \nhorribly.\n\nIn utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are \n<b>COMING RIGHT AT HER.\n</b>\n<b>ABOVE - THE SURFACE\n</b>\nMost of the crew has gotten up out of the water.

It falls back into the water.\n\n<b>CHRISTIE\n</b>\nA trap!  They set a goddamn ambush!\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nGive me that!\n\nHe pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him \nmouth to mouth.\n\nJohner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing \nSMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail \nbubble from below the surface.\n\nJOHNER (grinning feverishly)\n\nOkay!  Everybody out of the pool!\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nLet's get the fuck!\n\nDi Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand,\n\nHILLARD (to Wren)\n\nWhich way?\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nUp here.\n\nHe takes off, the others following.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nUp through the lift shaft!\n\nHe stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley \ncome up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt.\n\n<b>ST JUST\n</b>\nCompany!\n\nHe's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens.\n\nShe herds them into the shaft.\n\n<b>CUT TO: INT.

Enough room \nfor or three\n\nelevators, one of which is two stories below.\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\n<b>UP!\n</b>\nHe starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each \nshaft section.\n\nCall comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders.\n\nThey climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin \nPOUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might.\n\n<b>JOHNER\n</b>\nMove!\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nNot far!\n\nStill POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls \nit out.\n\n<b>ANGLE: LIFT\n</b>\nWren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet \nfrom the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad \nbeside it as Call climbs up behind him.\n\nThe aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft \nto grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming \nup the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans \non ladders.\n\nOn one of the aliens a facehugger crawls, constantly moving about on \nthe adult alien's head like a frightened spider.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nHurry!\n\n<b>WREN\n</b>\nIt's jammed!  Shit!  Gun!\n\nShe hands him her gun and without hesitation he SHOOTS HER THROUGH THE \n<b>CHEST.\n</b>\nShe flies back and DOWN THE SHAFT, lands HARD on an elevator six \nstories below.\n\nEyes wide and empty.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\n<b>NOO!\n</b>\nHe fires up at Wren, but Wren has punched in the code and slipped \nthrough the opening door..\n\nRipley LEAPS through the air and grabs the ledge, hauling herself up \njust in time to see  the door shut.  The lock lights turn red.\n\nShe SLAMS against the door, but to no avail.\n\nThe aliens are getting closer.  St Just, the closest to the bottom, \nsuddenly lets go of  the ladder.  His knees hooked over a rung, he \ndrops, hangs up side down, his guns  filling his hands.\n\nHe blows several holes in the nearest alien.\n\nRipley is furious, maybe surprised just how so.  Suddenly an alien \nRISES OVER THE LEDGE, it's not three feet away from her and she \nSCREAMS, HURLS herself at it and they both go\n\nFLYING OFF into-space, they hit the wall on the other side, they fall. \n\nRIPLEY GRABS a pole, it practically tears her arm out of her socket but \nshe holds on, the alien isn't so lucky, it plummets unable to find \npuchase. We see it fall past  the unmoving body of Call.\n\n<b>ANGTE: CALLS FACE\n</b>\nAs the facehugger CLAMPS onto it. Pauses. Pushes off a bit, two digits \nprobing Call's nostrils.  Sensing no breath, the thing scurries away to \nfind a better host.\n\nAnother alien is fast approching Christie and Vriess. Vriess \nfrantically tries to reload.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nIt's on us!\n\nChristie turns, aims -- Vriess grabs the ladder as Christie FIRES, but \nthe alien is too close, it grabs Christie, spurting blood all over him.  \nHe SCREAMS, lets go of the ladder\n\nVriess takes the weight of both as Christie fires again, the alien \nflying off  and down the shaft.\n\n<b>HILLARD\n</b>\nWe gotta go!\n\nThe last alien suddenly starts scurrying back down after his brothers.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nWe're locked in.\n\n<b>JOHNER \n</b>\nFuck!\n\n<b>PURVIS\n</b>\nHow far to the next door?\n\n<b>DISTEPHANO\n</b>\nAll the way.\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nThen we climb.\n\nThey start, moving as fast as they can.\n\nVRIESSS (to Christie)\n\nYou just hang on, man.

Ripley easily \nahead of the rest.\n\nFinally:\n\n<b>RIPLEY\n</b>\nI think I see the door.\n\nPURVIS (exhausted)\n\nGreat.\n\nVriess is having increasing trouble.  Hillard notices him lagging \nbehind, and why.\n\n<b>HILLARD\n</b>\nVriess!  Jesus!\n\nVriess is moving very quickly, considering. But the effort is becoming \ntoo much.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nWe're coming...\n\nJohner scrambles down next to Vriess.\n\nhe checks the pulse in Christie's neck.\n\nVriess, man... he's dead.\n\nRefusing to hear it, Vriess struggles to climb further.\n\n<b>VRIESS\n</b>\nWe'll get him to medlab... just a little while ...\n\nJohner looks over at Hillard.  Without saying a word, she pull out a \ngood-sized hunting  knife, flicks it open.\n\nShe slices through the cord holding them together, and Christie's body \nfalls free.\n\nVriess shuts his eyes, feeling it.

Is there anything fucking else we should \nknow about them?!\n\nHe's addressing this at Ripley, but she's as puzzled as the rest of \nthem.\n\nThe lift comes up to them, stops suddenly as emergency brake is \nflipped.\n\nThey wait, guns ready. Out of the hatch pops Call, not especially dead.\n\n<b>CALL\n</b>\nGet on!\n\nA moment of stunned silence, then they all jump on top of the lift.\n\nCall drops back down inside.\n\nAn alien comes up level with the lift, prepares to jump.

Bu the alien is still grabbing \nfor her --\n\nRipley pries open the doors again, the crew pouring out into the hall. \nRipley follows, jumps down and opens the lift doors\n\nThe alien hisses at Ripley as she pulls Call out -- the -alien grabs \nCall's ankle, but\n\nRipley wrenches her free.\n\nThey roll out but the alien is still fighting, Pulling itself inside \nthe lift.\n\nRipley grabs Hillardl's shotgun.  Levels it at the cables holding the \nlift.
