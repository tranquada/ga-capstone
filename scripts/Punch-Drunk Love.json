Do you remember all that\n            pudding?\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            Yeah.\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            So that pudding was bought, I\n            bought that pudding because of a\n            pretty interesting promotion that's\n            sponsored by Healthy Choice and\n            American Airlines. It's designed to\n            encourage airline travel and\n            obviously designed to encourage\n            buying Healthy Choice products.\n            They make frozen meals, deli meats,\n            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice\n            creams, this sort of thing.....\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            Yeah?\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            ....I'm sorry....I lost my\n            thoughts, what I was saying....\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            You were talking about the\n            promotion --\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            -- the promotion says: buy any 10\n            Healthy Choice products and get 500\n            miles of airline travel or 1,000\n            for purchases made with a special\n            coupon. So in the supermarket, you\n            notice their products, first you\n            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken\n            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty\n            good deal....but then I noticed\n            they had soup at 89 cents a\n            can.....and you start to do the\n            math and you start to notice that\n            it's a really amazing deal because\n            I stumbled across the pudding at 25\n            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing\n            is the bar codes on the label.\n            That's those little bar codes, you\n            know? The universal product codes?\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            Yeah.\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            That's what's used to redeem the\n            mileage, so in noticing the\n            pudding, each cup had an individual\n            bar code -- in other words: Two\n            dollars and fifty cents for ten\n            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add\n            in the coupon: it's one thousand.\n            You see?\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            Yeah.\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            You see?\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            Yeah, no, I see --\n\n<b>                         BARRY\n</b>            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars\n            on pudding you could earn over one\n            million frequent flyer miles.\n\n<b>                         LENA\n</b>            That's insane.
