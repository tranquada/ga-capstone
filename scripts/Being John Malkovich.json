The\n\tpuppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's\n\tbrow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special\n\tdevice that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet\n\tcollapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to\n\tits face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down\n\taround the front of the stage. He is heaving.

Join the struggle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t CRAIG\n</b>\t\t    You'll have me, after all I've done\n\t\t    to you?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LOTTE\n</b>\t\t    People make mistakes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t CRAIG\n</b>\t\t    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.\n\t\t    I just want you to know that.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LOTTE\n</b>\t\t    I know.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t CRAIG\n</b>\t\t    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to\n\t\t    help things grow, to encourage life.\n\t\t    Do you and your friends need a farmer?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LOTTE\n</b>\t\t    Sure. We could really use a farmer.\n\t\t    We'd be grateful for the help.\n\t\t\t    (beat)\n\t\t    Also, I think, you know, if you\n\t\t    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little\n\t\t    puppet show every once in a while,\n\t\t    would do a lot to lift our spirits.\n\t\t    You know, if you wouldn't mind too\n\t\t    terribly.\n\n\tCraig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LOTTE (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.\n\n\tShe puts her arm around him and leads him toward the\n\televator.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t CRAIG\n</b>\t\t    I love you, Lotte.\n\n\tWe come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put\n\tit around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.\n\tWe follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a\n\tmarionette being controlled from above by an emotionless\n\tMantini in a gray jumpsuit.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t MANTINI\n</b>\t\t\t    (in Craig's voice)\n\t\t    I can't wait to see where you and your\n\t\t    friends live, Lotte.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t LOTTE (O.S.)\n</b>\t\t    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.\n\n\tNow we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w\n\tfollow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t FLEMMER\n</b>\t\t    One serpent, coming up.\n\n\tFlemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves\n\tinto his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,\n\tlooks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal\n\ttunnel.\n\n\tMUSIC IN: \"Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head\" by They\n\tMight Be Giants. It plays throughout the credits.\n\n<b>\tFADE OUT\n</b>\n\n\n<b>\tTHE END\n</b>\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Being John Malkovich</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Charlie Kaufman\" title=\"Scripts by Charlie Kaufman\">Charlie Kaufman</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Comedy\" title=\"Comedy Scripts\">Comedy</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Fantasy\" title=\"Fantasy Scripts\">Fantasy</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Being John Malkovich Script.html#comments\" title=\"Being John Malkovich comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:00:14.707850"}
