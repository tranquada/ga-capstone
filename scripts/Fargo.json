A snowfall.\n\n\tA car bursts through the curtain of snow.\n\n\tThe car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,\n\ta brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales\n\tsticker showing in its rear window.\n\n\tAs the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,\n\tthe title of the film fades in.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFARGO\n</b>\n\tGreen highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,\n\tMINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities\n\tdiverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another\n\tjust after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.\n\n\tThe car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.\n\n<b>\tHOTEL LOBBY\n</b>\n\tA man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,\n\tgoes to the reception desk.

Then, with one curved arm half pressing\n\tagainst, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly\n\tsteps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the\n\ttrees angling toward the cabin and the source of the\n\tgrinding noise.\n\n\tShe slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her\n\tdownhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the\n\tnext.\n\n\tThe roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,\n\ther breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints\n\tdown toward the cabin's back lot.\n\n\tA tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted\n\tjacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a\n\tlarge power tool which his body blocks from view.\n\n\tMarge advances.\n\n\tThe man is forcing downward something which engages the\n\troaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.\n\n\tThe man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the\n\tcold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams\n\tas he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a\n\tshod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.\n\n\tThe roar is very loud.\n\n\tMarge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.\n\n\tGrimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we\n\tcan now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.\n\n\tMarge's eyes shift.\n\n\tA large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.\n\n\tGrimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends\n\tdown out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.\n\tHe uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.\n\n\tMarge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward\n\tGrimsrud, who is still turned away.\n\n\tGrimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.\n\n\tMarge closes in, grimacing.\n\n\tGrimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log\n\tthat pushes down into the machine.\n\n\tThe dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of\n\tCarl Showalter's body.\n\n\tMarge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it\n\tsounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the\n\troar of the power tool.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARGE\n</b>\t\tStop!  Police!  Turn around and\n\t\thands up!\n\n\tStartled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.\n\n\tHe stares.\n\n\tMarge bellows again:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARGE\n</b>\t\t...

He mutters in Swedish as he\n\treaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.\n\n\tMarge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand\n\treaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.\n\n\tIt comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with\n\ta snap of the wrist.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tMARGE\n</b>\t\t...  All right, buddy.  On your\n\t\tbelly and your hands clasped\n\t\tbehind you.\n\n<b>\tTHE CRUISER\n</b>\n\tMarge drives.
