KITCHEN - MORNING\r\n\r\n          ANGLE ON: BILLY MATTHEWS, 8, ravenously eating a plate\r\n          of hashbrowns, runny fried eggs and syrupy waffles.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)\r\n          Doug?...\r\n          We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,\r\n          staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that\r\n          honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you\r\n          move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns\r\n          with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look\r\n          and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then\r\n          looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites\r\n          and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.\r\n\r\n          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)\r\n          Doug?\r\n          Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY\r\n          MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          I've got some stuff to do for the party\r\n          tomorrow. Can you take Billy to school?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          What \"stuff\"? This party isn't going to\r\n          be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a\r\n          wing platter from Costco?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its\r\n          going to be a nice party with nice food\r\n          and nice music. And wings have carbs, so\r\n          you can't eat them anyway.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n\r\n                         (MOUTH FULL)\r\n          I'll eat 'em.\r\n          Doug gives Billy a look.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          No you won't.

There aren't any\r\n          emergencies at the office this morning.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          You have emergencies?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (INDIGNANT)\r\n          Yes, I have emergencies. That's what my\r\n          pager is for. one beep from that thing,\r\n          and bam. I'm off. Like a cheetah.\r\n          Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n\r\n                         (MOUTH FULL)\r\n          The battery ith gone in that thing. You\r\n          took them out for the TV clicker.\r\n          Doug gives Billy a look.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I did do that. I forgot about that. I\r\n          need to get some batteries in there.\r\n          Because dentists do have emergencies. We\r\n          are doctors, you know? We take the same\r\n          oath. The oath of saving lives.\r\n          Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.\r\n          Billy swats his hand away.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n\r\n                         (MOUTH FULL)\r\n          Uh uh. Carbth.\r\n          Doug nods, defeated, as Billy hops up and dumps the\r\n          remaining lucky charms in the trash.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 3.\r\n\r\n          INT. VOLVO - LATER THAT MORNING\r\n\r\n          DOUG drives a Volvo station wagon along the streets of\r\n          Cincinnati. BILLY is next to him, in the passenger\r\n          seat, looking bored. Doug notices.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You know, I use to race a car like this.\r\n          Put a hemi under the hood... Nobody saw\r\n          me coming.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n          Really?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yup. It could really... smoke some ass.\r\n          Billy raises his eyebrows, impressed. Doug smiles. This\r\n          was a good time to break the \"no saying ass\" rule.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Yes, sir. They called it the dragon\r\n          wagon. You're lucky to be in here\r\n          without a helmet, pal. We both are.\r\n          Doug downshifts a gear, and the tame engine roars\r\n          artificially. Billy is impressed.\r\n\r\n                         BILLY\r\n          Awesome! Hey, can I jam the radio?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Heck yeah, you can jam the radio.\r\n          Doug tussles Billy's hair and smiles.\r\n\r\n           SMASH CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. TRAFFIC LIGHT - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          The Volvo pulls up to a red light. Radio Disney blares\r\n          \"MICKEY LOVES MAMBO\" from the stereo. BILLY bobs his\r\n          head along with the music. DOUG looks out the window\r\n          and sees a mid-twenties guy in a Porsche, staring at him.\r\n          Doug nods hello, then awkwardly faces forward.\r\n\r\n                         FADE OUT:\r\n\r\n          FADE BACK IN ON:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 4.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Bob is\r\n          good enough looking, but with a gawky wimpishness and\r\n          burdened eyes. He tries to ignore the speakerphone.\r\n\r\n          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE (CONT'D)\r\n          Bob!?\r\n          Bob cringes at the shrill, female voice.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Hey, honey.\r\n\r\n          VOICE ON SPEAKERPHONE\r\n          You need to come tell Haley she can't go\r\n          to a party tonight.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          (into speaker phone)\r\n          Well, I'm technically at the office right\r\n          now, so...\r\n          The door behind him flings open, and KAREN LEVENSTEIN,\r\n          attractive and harsh-looking, steps in holding a phone.\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n          Are you kidding me!? You work in our\r\n          guest bedroom, not an office.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          I know, I was just trying to make this\r\n\r\n                         DEADLINE--\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n          Yeah, and I have to go to a job that\r\n          actually makes us money, Bob. So, get\r\n          out here and tell Haley she's not going\r\n          anywhere!\r\n          Bob nods obediently and hurries out of the room.\r\n\r\n          INT. BOB'S HOUSE / KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER\r\n\r\n          Bob enters the kitchen. His five year-old daughter,\r\n          CLAIRE, wearing a dance leotard, walks up to him and\r\n          smiles.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 5.\r\n\r\n                         CLAIRE\r\n          Hey, Daddy. Listen.\r\n          (screams at the top of her\r\n\r\n                         LUNGS)\r\n\r\n                         EEEEEIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAA1\r\n          Bob winces, and looks around for his other daughter.\r\n\r\n          SFX: PHONE RINGS\r\n          Bob reaches for it, but his other teenage daughter,\r\n          HALEY, runs in, wearing a denim mini-skirt and Ugg boots.\r\n\r\n                         HALEY\r\n          No!! Don't touch that! It's Julien!\r\n          Haley snatches the phone away from Bob.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Actually, I need to talk to you--\r\n\r\n                         HALEY\r\n\r\n                         (IGNORING BOB)\r\n          Hey, Julien. Yeah, totally.

I'm talking, here. God!\r\n          Haley storms out of the room. Bob goes to say something,\r\n          but CLAIRE enters and looks up at him.\r\n\r\n                         CLAIRE\r\n\r\n                         (SCREAMING AGAIN)\r\n          Eeeeeeeiiiiiaaaaa!!\r\n          Bob just stares at her, as Karen enters the Kitchen.\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n          (yelling above Claire)\r\n          Did you talk to her?

And we\r\n          agreed that my career would be the\r\n          priority, and you would work out of the\r\n          house. You might not like it, but my job\r\n          is higher paying.

You don't want to wear nice\r\n          things, don't. Off!\r\n          Bob sighs and takes the shirt off. Karen snatches it\r\n          from him.\r\n\r\n                         KAREN (CONT'D)\r\n          Now take Claire to her ballet class.\r\n          It's starts in five minutes.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Well, I have to get another--\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n          Go!

BOB'S CAR - A MOMENT LATER\r\n\r\n          Bob sits in the car, SHIRTLESS, next to Claire. He looks\r\n          over at her, and notices a pink hoodie in her lap.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          You going to wear that?\r\n\r\n                         CLAIRE\r\n          For five dollars, I'm not.\r\n          Bob sighs and reaches for his wallet.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 7.\r\n\r\n          INT. CHILDREN'S DANCE STUDIO - FIVE MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          A bunch of kids in dance leotards are starting a class.\r\n          Claire comes running into the group, as Bob enters behind\r\n          her, wearing the pink hoodie. It's way too small, and\r\n          doesn't quite cover his belly. He sits with the parents\r\n          and nods awkwardly to them. It's embarrassing.\r\n\r\n          FADE TO BLACK:\r\n\r\n          FADE BACK IN ON:\r\n\r\n          INT. MODERN HOUSE - MORNING\r\n\r\n          We see the pristine living room of an expensive,\r\n          architectural house.\r\n\r\n          MALE VOICE (O.C.)\r\n          Woody.\r\n\r\n                         (GETTING ANGRY)\r\n          Woody Stevens!\r\n          We see WOODY STEVENS, 40s, handsome, but with shifty eyes\r\n          and a Michael Keaton hairline, walk through the stylish\r\n          house speaking into a cordless headset.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          .No, you listen to me. You're not\r\n          going to push me around. We agreed on a\r\n          price, and that's the price I'll pay.

Thanks, doctor.\r\n          Doug nods. He looks around for something else to do, but\r\n          there's nothing.

Matthews is open.\r\n          Billy looks up and cringes a little bit, but passes the\r\n          ball to DOUG. Doug dribbles it under his leg and charges\r\n          the basket.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Taking it into the paint. Who's got the\r\n          D? Whoop, too late, dudes! Booya!\r\n          Doug jumps up to slam the ball, but only hammers it into\r\n          the rim. The rim clangs loudly and the ball goes flying\r\n          backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug\r\n          notices.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Well, that's not really my shot. I\r\n          usually hit from downtown, you know?\r\n          Doug grabs the ball out of the bushes and dribbles back\r\n          to the three point line.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 13.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          That's where the big games get won. Back\r\n          here from the three--\r\n          Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads\r\n          towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.\r\n          It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his\r\n          head, humiliated.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          That was a pass, dudes!\r\n          It wasn't.\r\n          Doug nods with false confidence to the kids, stands there\r\n          awkwardly for a moment, then quietly heads inside.\r\n\r\n          INT.

Doug puts the bag\r\n          of celery down.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I'm okay.

He looks around the neighborhood\r\n          cockily, smiles, then kicks the bike into gear and rides\r\n          into the street.

DOUG and BOB turn the corner and nod to him.\r\n          Woody nods back, revs his engine, and joins alongside\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DUDLEY'S COMPUTER-CLUTTERED GARAGE - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          We see a garage crowded with disassembled Apple\r\n          computers, printers, and a Harley Davidson Sportster.\r\n          Out walks DUDLEY, who's biker outfit doesn't quite mesh\r\n          with his thick-lensed eyeglasses.\r\n          Dudley cockily pulls on a \"Wild Hogs\" jacket, kick starts\r\n          the motorcycle, presses a button to open the garage door,\r\n          and rides the motorcycle out. However, as he gets\r\n          halfway out of the garage, the garage door catches on\r\n          something, and snaps back down. It clotheslines Dudley\r\n          off the bike, which rolls down the driveway and into some\r\n          garbage cans. Dudley lays in the driveway, staring up at\r\n          the sky with a pained look on his face.\r\n\r\n          EXT. DUDLEY'S DRIVEWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride towards Dudley's house, but find\r\n          DUDLEY sitting in his driveway with his arms around his\r\n          knees. He shrugs and motions to his motorcycle - Which\r\n          he has stood back up, but has a bent wheel and smashed\r\n          headlight. Doug and Bob take in the situation and then\r\n          look at Woody. Woody rolls his eyes...\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - LATER\r\n\r\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY ride along. We see DUDLEY is riding\r\n          bitch on Woody's bike, and Woody doesn't seem thrilled\r\n          about it. The camera pans around and we see they are all\r\n          wearing \"Wild Hogs\" jackets. And on this, we:\r\n\r\n          END MUSIC CUE\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. \"BYKER'S ISLAND\" BIKER BAR - LATER\r\n\r\n          The guys pull up at a biker-theme bar with a motorcycle\r\n          mounted above the entrance.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 16.\r\n          Woody is obviously humiliated to have Dudley behind him,\r\n          as they park the bikes among a crowd of other bikers.\r\n          Dudley climbs off the back of Woody's bike and pats him\r\n          on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Thanks, Woody. I feel really safe with\r\n          you.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I noticed that. And if you ever lay your\r\n          head on my back when you're riding bitch\r\n          again, I'm going to throw you into\r\n          traffic.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I was trying to keep my face out of the\r\n          wind.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I felt you smell my hair!\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Guys!

The place is\r\n          crowded with curiously gentle-looking bikers. Woody\r\n          looks around the bar with a smirk.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Man, I wish we could find a place that\r\n          wasn't so freaking lame.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          What are you talking about?

We're Wild Hogs.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          We're not Wild Hogs.

She's very hot. Even after\r\n          ten years. Not that I'm not still good\r\n          looking...\r\n          Doug looks at the guys.

Like, siding?\r\n          (considers, then)\r\n          Yeah, that feels about right. Aluminum\r\n          is sturdy, lightweight... recycled.\r\n          Woody smiles and puts a map down on the table.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          --And ready for the trip of a lifetime.\r\n          The guys look at the map, puzzled.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We don't need a map for Daytona.

It's time for a\r\n          change. Let's go on our own trip this\r\n          year. Just us, like it was in college.\r\n          Forget these guys. Forget Daytona beach.\r\n          Bike Week is just corporate white guys\r\n          playing dress up. This bar is, too. And\r\n          we didn't get into this to play dress up -\r\n          we got in this to live. \"Be cool and\r\n          Ride free.\" That's the Wild Hog creed.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          No, it's not. It's the slogan for the\r\n          Downtown trolley.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I know. But, it works as our creed, too.\r\n          So let's live it!\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          But, I boogie board in Daytona.

Let the big\r\n          people talk.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, what kind of trip are you\r\n          suggesting? Another bike week somewhere?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No. That's the best part. We don't do\r\n          some planned out trip. We follow the\r\n          open road. U.S. 50. The backbone of\r\n          America. We take a week and go all the\r\n          way to San Francisco. Think about it,\r\n          guys. Camping out, stopping wherever we\r\n          want, whenever we want... Just freedom.\r\n          When was the last time we had that?\r\n          The guys consider this, but look sceptical.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          I don't know, man.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You're afraid to ask your wife.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n\r\n                         (COVERING)\r\n          No...\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (TO DOUG)\r\n          What do you think?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, Daytona isn't the \"backbone of\r\n          America,\" but it is a tradition.

Drop a\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          hint.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          It's eight O'Clock. It started at seven.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          oh.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Still, that's late. We should just\r\n          flicker the lights on and off. People\r\n          will get it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 22.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          People are having fun. Look at the\r\n          Miltons.\r\n          ANGLE ON: THE LIVING ROOM. A happy-looking couple, THE\r\n          MILTONS, are dancing around to Prince's \"1999.\" Doug \r\n          laughs. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG \r\n          Oh, man. There should be laws against \r\n          that... Is Fred having a seizure? \r\n\r\n                         KELLY \r\n          No, Fred's having a good time. With his \r\n          wife. Remember what that was like? \r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, we have fun all the time. But I'm\r\n          not going to let myself look like that.\r\n          He wears dress socks with shorts, too.\r\n          I've seen it. Do you want me to do that?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY \r\n          I don't care. Why do you? \r\n          Doug searches for a response, as ROGER, 70, Kelly's Dad, \r\n          clinks his wine glass at the front of the room. \r\n\r\n                         ROGER \r\n          Excuse me, everybody. I have a little \r\n          toast. For my daughter and her husband. \r\n          Roger winks at Doug and Kelly. Doug smiles weakly. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG \r\n          (sotto, to Kelly) \r\n          He's drunk. We should do something. \r\n\r\n                         ROGER \r\n          I want to start by saying how proud I am \r\n          of my son-in-law. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG \r\n          (sotto, to Kelly) \r\n          --No, he's fine. Let him talk. \r\n\r\n                         ROGER\r\n          Now, I have to make an admission. Ten\r\n          years ago, when Doug and Kelly got\r\n          married. I was worried. Doug was a\r\n          little wild...\r\n          The guests laugh. Doug gives an unsure chuckle.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 23.\r\n\r\n                         ROGER (CONT'D)\r\n          I mean, he had that old trans-am with the\r\n          huge engine... Remember how he'd peel\r\n          out of anywhere? Even the grocery\r\n          parking lot after buying baby formula?\r\n          The guests laugh again. Now Doug isn't.\r\n\r\n                         ROGER (CONT'D)\r\n          Or the way he'd just grab Kelly and run\r\n          off to some crazy island to snorkel with\r\n          something that thinks you're lunch.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          The guests continue to laugh. Kelly looks at Doug, now.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          She sees this is landing on him. He's getting upset.\r\n\r\n                         ROGER (CONT'D)\r\n          But, not anymore. He's now become the\r\n          son-in-law I would have always hoped for.\r\n          Responsible, reliable, and a great\r\n          husband to my daughter. So cheers to--\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          No, no. No cheers-- Because that wasn't\r\n          an accurate toast. I'm still the same,\r\n          shitty son-in-law I used to be.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          The guests laugh. They think he's joking.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n                         ROGER\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Come on, Doug. You should be proud!\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          You've grown up! Cheers!\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          The guests nod and clink their glasses. Doug shakes his\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          head.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Grown up? No, I haven't. I'm still\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          young. No cheers! Stop clinking!\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Doug, stop it. You're being rude.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Well, tell them I'm the same as I used to\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          be, Kelly. Tell your Dad not to like me.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          You're not the same, Doug. The old Doug\r\n          wouldn't have made fun of Fred Milton for\r\n          dancing, because he would have been out\r\n          there dancing himself. With me.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 24.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          So what are you saying?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          I'm saying you have changed. And\r\n          frankly, i don't like it. I like you the\r\n          way you were. I liked it when you\r\n          weren't afraid of looking stupid. I\r\n          liked it when we laughed. I liked it\r\n          when we danced.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, I'll dance! It's just this music is\r\n          lame. People like me need a fresh beat!\r\n          Doug walks over to the stereo and changes the station.\r\n          \"Cand Sho \" h y-50 Cent starts playing. Doug nods along\r\n          with the beat, as the guests all now stare at him.\r\n\r\n                          DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n           (yelling over music)\r\n           Awwww, yeah. This is the shit! It ain't\r\n           1980 anymore, man. Yeah!\r\n\r\n                          (SINGS ALONG)\r\n           I take you to the... Andy shop--\r\n           Doug tries to confidently sing along, but struggles \r\n           awkwardly, as he's obviously never heard the song before. \r\n\r\n                          KELLY \r\n           (urging, to Doug) \r\n           Honey, stop it. You're being an ass. \r\n\r\n                          DOUG \r\n           What!? I thought this was what you \r\n           wanted? I'm dancing!\r\n           Doug starts grinding and shimmying to the beat. Kelly \r\n          grits her teeth. \r\n\r\n                          DOUG (CONT'D) \r\n           Come on, baby! Just because we're \r\n           married ten years doesn't mea n we're old \r\n           people. Let's dance! It fee ls goooood! \r\n           Doug makes another spastic dance move, then suddenly \r\n          grimaces and grabs his chest.\r\n\r\n                          DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n           Nope, that feels bad--\r\n\r\n                          KELLY\r\n           Doug? What's wrong? Are you okay? \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 25.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. I'm just-- Ow: That's-- Yeah, I\r\n          should go to the hospital--\r\n          Doug staggers across the carpet as people run to help\r\n          him.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Doug!?\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - AN HOUR LATER\r\n\r\n          Doug is in a bed, with Kelly next to him. A DOCTOR\r\n          enters with a chart.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Well, Mr. Matthews--\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Dr. Matthews, actually.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Oh, really? Great. Then, I can say this\r\n          a lot easier. You had a hypertensive\r\n          myocardial seizure.\r\n          Doug nods confidently, then, after a moment:\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (DEFEATED)\r\n          I'm a dentist, actually... I have no\r\n          idea what you just said.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Oh. Sorry. It looks like you had a\r\n          stress-induced panic attack.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Stress-induced? I'm not stressed.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Well, it's probably been pretty buried. I\r\n          actually see it a lot with middle-aged men.\r\n          Work, family, it can take a toll on you.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I'm not middle-aged.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 26.\r\n\r\n                         DOCTOR\r\n          Yeah, I see that a lot, too. Anyway. We\r\n          should have you out of here soon.\r\n          The doctor smiles and exits the room. Kelly looks at\r\n          Doug.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I am middle aged, aren't I?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Only mathematically.\r\n          Doug takes this in.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY (CONT'D) \r\n          Doug, Let me ask you a question. When\r\n          was the last time you sang a Bon Jovi\r\n          song?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          You used to sing Bon Jovi songs at the\r\n          top of your lungs. Like you didn't care\r\n          who heard you, or how dopey it sounded.\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          Then one day, you just stopped. That's\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          how it's been with everything. Romance,\r\n          sense of humor, the way you used to give\r\n          me that cocky little wink when you took\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          off your shirt... It's all faded away,\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          leaving just a shell of what you used to\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          be. Why? Why no more Bon Jovi songs?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I don't know. There's just a lot\r\n          weighing me down these days, you know?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Like what? You have a great career, a\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          perfect family. Money is fine. The only\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          thing that could be weighing you down is\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          me. Is it me? Are you tired of me?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                          \r\n          No! of course, not. I could never be\r\n\r\n                         TIRED OF--\r\n          Doug stops himself, as it dawns on him. You can see the\r\n          horror of realization creep across his face. He looks at\r\n          Kelly, wide-eyed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 27.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (REALIZING)\r\n          It's me. I'm weighing me down. I'm not\r\n          a guy I'd hang out with anymore, I'm...\r\n          Me. What's cool about me? I don't even\r\n          eat carbs. \r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Then eat them. I'd rather have you sing \r\n          than have a thirty-four waist. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG \r\n          I still have a thirty-- \r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          No, you don't, Doug. I buy your pants.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Look. We've been married ten years. And\r\n          personally, I'd like to be married fifty\r\n          more, but if you stay like this...\r\n          Then... I don't know...\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We are going to be married fifty more\r\n          years, Kelly. I'm going to find old\r\n          Doug. I just have to figure out where to\r\n          look.\r\n          Kelly takes a breath, and pulls out a map. She hands it \r\n          to Doug, who looks at it. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D) \r\n          Woody's map? \r\n\r\n                         KELLY \r\n          I took it away from him at the party. He \r\n          wouldn't stop waving it at Bob and \r\n          Dudley. \r\n\r\n                         DOUG \r\n          I thought you agreed it was a bad idea. \r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          It might be. But I'm desperate, Doug. I\r\n          want us to be happy again. So go on it.\r\n          It's my anniversary present to you.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Really?\r\n          (considers, then)\r\n          I only got you an ankle bracelet.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 28.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          All I want is old Doug back. Please.\r\n          This marriage can't survive without him. \r\n          Doug takes this in, and smiles at her. She's a good\r\n          wife, and he knows it. Suddenly, BOB enters the room.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Doug! Are you okay?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah, I'm okay. Just stress.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Oh, man. Thank god.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          Where's Karen?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Oh, she's waiting in the parking--\r\n          SFX: A loud honk from the parking lot.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n          That's her.\r\n          Bob looks out the window nervously. Kelly looks at Doug.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          You all need this trip.\r\n          Doug gives her a knowing nod, then turns to Bob.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Bob. Let's forget about Daytona Bike\r\n          week. Let's ride across U.S. 50.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Yeah? Are you sure? I mean, We'll be\r\n          leaving behind everything we're used to.\r\n          SFX: The horn honks again from outside.\r\n\r\n          KAREN (O.C.)\r\n          (yelling from parking lot)\r\n          Bob!? You said two minutes! I'm not\r\n          circling!!\r\n          Bob cringes. Doug shares a look with Kelly, then to Bob:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 29.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. I think that might be okay.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET - THE NEXT WEEK\r\n\r\n          DOUG is riding his Harley, which is loaded with gear\r\n          (sleeping bag, spare gas tank, saddle bags). He\r\n          approaches a freeway entrance ramp, where WOODY and\r\n          DUDLEY and BOB are waiting on their bikes, next to an\r\n          entrance ramp sign that reads: U.S. Highway 50. The guys\r\n          all tap fists, then notice Dudley is grinning ear to ear.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (TO DUDLEY)\r\n          What? What's wrong with you?\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I got a tat.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          A tattoo? You got a tattoo?\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I'm a biker, dude! I got a tat!\r\n          Dudley yanks his jacket down to his elbows and we see he\r\n          is wearing a sleeveless shirt underneath. On his bicep\r\n          is a tattoo of the Macintosh Apple. The guys nod, trying\r\n          to look impressed.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wow. That's...\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Trademarked, I know. But what are they\r\n          going to do? It's in my skin, bitch!\r\n          Dudley laughs and pulls on his jacket, as Woody ties a\r\n          bandana skull-cap on his head. The guys look at Woody.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You're not wearing a helmet?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Nape. I don't want anything between me\r\n          and the road, man.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You will if your head falls on it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 30.\r\n          Woody shrugs and starts his bike.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Look, the only rule on this trip is to\r\n          have no plan. We're riding to San\r\n          Francisco, and nothing else is planned.\r\n          Just riding free.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, if we're going to make it in five\r\n          days, we'll should probably get to\r\n          Illinois by tonight.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Yeah, the way I mapped it out - we should\r\n          be a hundred miles past St. Louis by\r\n          sundown.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          What? No. No plan. It's the open road.\r\n          Who knows where we'll be.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I do. I have this little GPS system.\r\n          Doug shows them a handheld GPS system. Woody grabs it\r\n          and throws it into a storm drain.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Hey! What the hell, man? That was\r\n          expensive!\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I did it for the good of the trip, Doug.\r\n          You don't need GPS to discover America.\r\n          We just need the wind, our bikes, and\r\n          freedom. And if we have an emergency, I\r\n          always have a cell phone--\r\n          Woody takes out a cellphone. Doug grabs it and throws it\r\n          in the storm drain.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hah! How's that feel?\r\n          Woody gives Doug a long look, then slowly smiles.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          It felt good. It felt damn good.\r\n\r\n                         (ANNOUNCES)\r\n          No cell phones!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 31.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (WORRIED)\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          He's right, Doug.

I mean, shouldn't we at least--\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Yeeeeaaah! Freedom!!\r\n          Dudley throws his cellphone, but instead of going into\r\n          the storm drain, it goes flying into traffic and smashes\r\n          against an oncoming pickup truck. We hear the truck\r\n          screech to a stop after it passes them.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (QUICKLY)\r\n          Okay, let's ride!\r\n          The guys all hastily start their bikes and take off up\r\n          the freeway ramp. We hear the truck driver screaming\r\n          profanities as they guiltily ride away.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY\r\n\r\n          MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT's \"(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER.\"\r\n          The four guys ride along the highway, through the hills\r\n          of Indiana, smiling and nodding to each other. It's the\r\n          Easy Rider moment. The camera ROTATES AROUND and PULLS\r\n          OVERHEAD. It's beautiful country and the guys are in\r\n          heaven. Dudley wears a clunky helmet from the eighties,\r\n          as well as World War II motorcycle goggles.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 32.\r\n          A family in a station wagon pulls up to next to them.\r\n          Two kids press their faces against the windows, looking\r\n          at the bikers in awe. Bob looks over at the kids in his\r\n          mirrored sunglasses and gives them a badass nod. The\r\n          kids are amazed. Bob looks to Doug. Doug grins. They\r\n          love this. Bob gives a signal to the other guys and guns\r\n          his engine. The others nod, gun their engines and speed\r\n          away from the station wagon. The kids watch with their\r\n          mouths open.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          The guys are cruising along as before, but now we see the\r\n          sky has gotten very cloudy and overcast.\r\n\r\n          SFX: THUNDER CRACK\r\n          The guys look up at the sky apprehensively.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          It's now pouring rain. The guys ride along in misery,\r\n          getting soaked. After a moment, the station wagon from\r\n          before pulls back up to them. The kids are still pressed\r\n          against the window, staring at the drenched bikers. Bob\r\n          looks over and tries to give them another cocky nod - but\r\n          now it's just embarrassing.\r\n\r\n          END MUSIC CUE\r\n\r\n          EXT. ROADSIDE US-50 - THAT EVENING\r\n\r\n          The sun has gone down, and the guys have found a deserted\r\n          area off the highway to set up camp. DOUG, WOODY and BOB\r\n          lounge by a fire - with a tent set up behind them. Doug\r\n          is roasting marshmallows and Bob is straining to blow up\r\n          an air mattress.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          Why didn't you just bring a sleeping bag\r\n          like us?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          This is more comfortable.\r\n          (blows a breath into it)\r\n          I wish Karen would have let me buy the\r\n          foot pump, though.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 33.\r\n          Bob continues to inflate the mattress, as Dudley\r\n          approaches with a knotted plastic grocery bag.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          This is poop. Don't eat it.\r\n          Dudley sets the bag aside and has a seat by the fire.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Dudley? You're supposed to bury that.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yes. Go bury it.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          It's in a plastic bag. I can't put that\r\n          in the earth. I'll find a trash bin\r\n          tomorrow.\r\n          The guys shake their heads and look back into the fire.\r\n          After a moment, Doug smiles.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          This is really nice, you know? Chilling\r\n          by the fire with your best friends.

Ones without carbs.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          I know what you're talking about. I\r\n          lost old Bob, too. I think my wife and\r\n          daughters killed him.

No. I was going to say miserable.\r\n          You think I'm a wimp?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          No. I just thought that was what you\r\n          were... I thought you wanted us to\r\n          guess, and I didn't have a guess, so I\r\n          said \"wimp.\" Knowing it was wrong...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 35.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You're a wimp, Bob.

Like,\r\n          when Karen sleeps, she still crawls over\r\n          and pushes up against me. Just snuggles\r\n          right up like she needs me.

Big job at an investment firm.\r\n          You've got the good life.\r\n          Woody doesn't respond.

The liquid hits the tent and it explodes into\r\n          flames. The guys shield themselves.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Gas! That's the spare gas tank, Dudley!\r\n          Dudley doesn't know what to say. The fire quickly\r\n          disentergrates the tent.

After a moment,\r\n          DUDLEY runs back up with the correct water jug and\r\n          empties it on what is now a flaming pile of ash.

They look boiling,\r\n          and have sweated through their clothes. Bob takes a\r\n          drink of water from a bottle of water, then pours the\r\n          water over his head. He breathes a sigh of relief, until\r\n          he hears an angry yell behind him. He looks back and\r\n          sees Woody is now drenched from the water. Bob smiles\r\n          sheepishly as Woody burns.\r\n\r\n          EXT.

The\r\n          young kids run and jump into the water. The Dad of the\r\n          family laughs and shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         FAMILY DAD\r\n          Hope you guys don't mind a little\r\n          company. The mini-van was getting a\r\n\r\n                         LITTLE--\r\n          The Dad stops talking as he sees into the water... He\r\n          realizes, then looks at his kids, concerned.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Um... Well, we're just taking a dip. I\r\n\r\n                         UH--\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          There's a shallower spring up the path.\r\n          The kids might like that even more...\r\n          The Mom lays down a blanket and turns to the guys. The\r\n          Dad is still staring, not sure what to do.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 42.\r\n\r\n                         FAMILY MOM\r\n\r\n                         (TO WOODY)\r\n          Oh, no. These little squirts like to\r\n\r\n                         DIVE AND--\r\n          The Mom sees a glimmer of something through the water,\r\n          and realizes. She suddenly looks very uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n          FAMILY MOM (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (VERY TENSE)\r\n          Janey, Kyle, Holland.

Now!\r\n          The kids climb out of the water and the parents hurry off\r\n          with them down the path. After a moment of awkward\r\n          silence, Doug looks at the guys.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We should go.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          You think?

They\r\n          stare, horrified, as he pops up and smiles at them.\r\n\r\n                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN\r\n          Saw you're bikes out there.

HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATE THAT AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          The guys are back on their bikes, cruising along the\r\n          wheat fields of Kansas. They're looking tired once\r\n          again, but suddenly Doug smiles...\r\n          On the horizon, a bar comes into view. Out front are\r\n          several rows of Harley Davidsons. Doug points it out to\r\n          the guys and they all smile. It's like an oasis.\r\n          The pull into the parking lot and climb off their bikes.\r\n          Bob immediately falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Dammit! Leg's asleep.\r\n          The guys go to help Bob up, as Dudley gets off his bike\r\n          and falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Me, too.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You guys have to shift every once in\r\n          awhile. Blood has to circulate.\r\n          A MOMENT LATER. Dudley and Bob are up and wiggling their\r\n          sleeping limbs, as Woody looks up at the bar.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Now this is the best part of any road\r\n          trip. Seeing our brothers on wheels.\r\n          Look at this place. America!\r\n          The guys look at it and nod. It is a cool looking shack\r\n          of a bar. Doug admires the row of motorcycles out front.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Look at these bikes. They're all\r\n          classics.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Oh, man. Check it out. A 1951 Panhead.\r\n          You know how rare this thing is?\r\n          The guys all crowd around the bike.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah, but why didn't he customize it?\r\n          You have a 51 panhead and you don't\r\n          chrome out the exhaust? Or airbrush an\r\n          eagle on the gas tank?

We'll leave 'em a catalog.\r\n          The guys push open the door and step into the bar.\r\n\r\n          INT. BIKER BAR - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The bar is full of bikers, but not the kind we saw\r\n          before. These guys are greasy, tattooed and menacing.\r\n          We see their jackets say \"Hells Angels.\" The bikers turn\r\n          and stare at WOODY, DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BIKERS)\r\n          How's it going?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Hells Angels, huh? You guys are legends.\r\n          I'm surprised we've never seen you in\r\n          Daytona.\r\n          The bikers kind of chuckle to themselves. The leader of\r\n          the gang, JACK, steps forward. He's in his late 40's -\r\n          and looks like he could break you into bite size pieces.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Yeah, how do we keep missing that?\r\n          The bikers all laugh. Doug and the guys join in, though\r\n          they don't quite get what's so funny.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          So you re \"Wild Hogs,\" huh? That's your\r\n          gang?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, not a gang. Just friends. Friends\r\n          that ride... you know.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          So it's like a little hobby for you guys?\r\n          How sweet.\r\n          Doug smiles, but is now sensing the hostility. He looks\r\n          back for the exit.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n\r\n                         (TO JACK)\r\n          Yeah, just a little hobby for us.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 45.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          We're all successful professionals in\r\n          real life. But on Tuesday and Sunday\r\n          afternoons... We're bikers!\r\n          Dudley spins around and shows them the back of his\r\n          jacket.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Wow. That's great. Can I try that on?\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Hell yeah, brother.\r\n          Dudley whips his jacket off and hands it to Jack, who\r\n          pulls it on his massive frame. He shows it to the gang,\r\n          who laugh again. Dudley does, too.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          So who's '51 panhead is that? Sweet\r\n          ride. Woody has a catalog so you can\r\n          make it cool.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No, I don't. Doug does. I think it's\r\n          great the way it is.\r\n          Doug glares at Woody incredulously. Woody shrugs.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (TO DUDLEY)\r\n          Well, if you like my '51, we should\r\n          trade... \"brother.\"\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY--\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n\r\n                         (IGNORING DOUG)\r\n          I wish!

Dudley's got some balls.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          No, my sidecar's just attached to your\r\n          bike. I'd prefer to turn back, but I\r\n          could only roll so far...\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I can't believe you guys. What a bunch\r\n          of pussies. The whole point of this trip\r\n          is to live, man.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          That's the point, Woody. Our lives\r\n          aren't on this highway. They're back\r\n          home. We have families, jobs, wives...\r\n          or cats... We're not going to piss off a\r\n          biker gang. We're going back.\r\n          Woody takes this in, gritting his teeth in disappointment.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Come on, Woody. You don't want to take\r\n          this risk. You have Claudia, and your\r\n          job... You have a great life back home.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 49.\r\n          Woody looks up at him. Something about this has sparked\r\n          something in Woody's eyes, but he covers it up with a\r\n          calm smile.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You're right, I do. But maybe I should\r\n          talk to those guys one more time. I\r\n          mean, I'm an executive at an Investment\r\n          firm. I've made a career out of\r\n          convincing people and these are just\r\n          people. You guys wait here.\r\n          Woody starts up his bike. Doug and Bob look at each\r\n          other and shrug. Dudley hurries out of the sidecar.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I'll wait here, too. You'll get better\r\n          gas mileage.\r\n          Dudley gets out and falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Leg's asleep.\r\n          Woody shakes his head and starts back to the bar.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          Woody rides up to the bar, and looks back to make sure\r\n          he's out of Doug, Bob and Dudley's sight. He sees that\r\n          he is, and kneels next to the line of Hells Angels\r\n          motorcycles. He takes out an army knife, and slices\r\n          through one of the motorcycle's gas line. Gas starts\r\n          leaking out onto the ground and Woody nods.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (TO HIMSELF)\r\n          Come after us now, assholes.\r\n          Woody goes along to each bike, smiling with a weird\r\n          recklessness as he slices through each gas line.\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          WOODY pulls up on his bike, where DOUG, BOB and DUDLEY\r\n          are waiting.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          They're cool with it. We can press on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 50.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Seriously?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yup. I tried to be polite. I tried to\r\n          reason. I told them Dudley was dying.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Well, technically we're all dying,\r\n          Dudley. Just very slowly.\r\n          Dudley looks concerned.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Oh my god, you're right.\r\n\r\n                         (REALIZING)\r\n          I'm slowly dying.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Anyway, none of that worked. So I laid\r\n          it out for them. I said, \"Hey, go ahead\r\n          and assault us. Because we might be not\r\n          be real bikers, but we know real lawyers.\r\n          And the moment you touch us is the moment\r\n          you get your ass sued. Because this is\r\n          the real world - with real laws, and real\r\n          consequences.\" And they backed down.\r\n          The guys are impressed.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You really said that?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yup. And I think they'll give us\r\n          Dudley's bike on the way back, so let's\r\n          go. Quick. Before they change their\r\n          mind.\r\n          Woody quickly starts his bike and rides on. The guys\r\n          shrug, impressed, and follow him.\r\n          After a moment, we see them all speed by the bar.\r\n\r\n          INT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          Jack is playing darts with the other bikers. He goes to\r\n          throw a dart and hears engines roar past the bar outside.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 51.\r\n          He quickly turns, which makes the dart he was throwing\r\n          fly off target and stick into the shoulder of one of the\r\n          bikers, (OILCAN).\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN\r\n          Ow! Shit, man!\r\n          Jack listens as the engines pass the bar and fade away.\r\n          Jack shakes his head, enraged.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Saddle up, boys. Somebody doesn't listen.\r\n          The guys nod and head outside. Oilcan pulls the dart out\r\n          of his shoulder, and stops by Jack on the way out.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN\r\n          Try and watch the throws, okay Jack?\r\n          Jack glares at oilcan for a beat, then jabs a dart into\r\n          his peck.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Owww! Jesus!\r\n          (off Jack's icy glare)\r\n          Sorry.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. BIKER BAR - A MINUTE LATER\r\n\r\n          The Hells Angels roar away from the bar on their\r\n          motorcycles. They get to the end of the driveway, and\r\n          the bikes sputter and choke to a stop.\r\n          ANGLE ON: JACK. He's on his hog, with a cigarette\r\n          dangling out of his mouth. He looks down in confusion at\r\n          the suddenly stalled bike.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What the f--\r\n          (sees cut gas line)\r\n          You've gotta be kidding me.\r\n          Suddenly, the cigarette falls out of Jacks mouth, and\r\n          onto the ground. A puddle of gas from the sliced line\r\n          catches on fire.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          shit.\r\n          The flames quickly follow the line of leaked gas like a\r\n          fuse, back towards the bar.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 52.\r\n          Almost as quickly as the bikers can turn to look, the\r\n          flame has reached the parking area and ignited all the\r\n          puddles of gas. They all watch in horror as the fire\r\n          ravenously engulfs the old wooden porch of the bar, then\r\n          the roof ...\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          The guys happily cruise along the highway. We see WOODY\r\n          look in his side-view mirror and notice a large, black\r\n          plume of smoke back in the distance. A look of worry\r\n          creeps over his face.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT.

You already have two\r\n          white ones, anyway.\r\n          The guys ignore him.

My\r\n          wife had extra patches.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Well, sweet Mary Joseph... Welcome to\r\n          Lucas! I'm the sheriff, Charley Baskins.\r\n          I keep the peace here.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Weren't you just hiding in the kitchen?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Well... A non-confrontation approach\r\n          sometimes is the best method to keep\r\n          aggression...\r\n\r\n                         (GIVES UP)\r\n          Yeah, I was hiding in the kitchen.\r\n          Charley looks at them for a moment, then starts to tear\r\n          up.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          I'm an embarrassment.\r\n          Charley hurries off to the bathroom. The guys look at\r\n          each other.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, now he is.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 63.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MAIN STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          CHARLEY walks through the town square with DOUG, BOB,\r\n          WOODY and DUDLEY. There's a stage and booths set up\r\n          around the park in the center - ready for the block\r\n          party. As the news spreads that the Wild Hogs are\r\n          friendly, the townspeople start to take to the streets\r\n          again.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Sorry about all the confusion when you\r\n          arrived. Those guys are pretty rough.\r\n          You're the first people to ever stand up\r\n          to them.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, Woody is the one who really--\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Hey-- we should probably share the\r\n          credit. I mean, I just basically kicked\r\n          that guy's ass. Man! You know how good\r\n          that felt!? Yeah!\r\n          Bob punches a handicapped parking sign, which rattles\r\n          against its post, then falls to the ground. Bob\r\n          immediately looks regretful.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Nice. Now the paraplegics can park down\r\n          the block and get more exercise.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          (suddenly meek again)\r\n          Should I fix it? Oh, man. I should.\r\n\r\n                         (TO CHARLEY)\r\n          I'm sorry... I didn't mean to--\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Forget about it. We only have one\r\n          cripple and he gets pulled around in a\r\n          wagon. Come on, I want to show you guys\r\n          something.\r\n          Charley leads the guys off.\r\n\r\n          INT. POLICE GARAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          Charley flips on the light in a neatly organized police\r\n          garage. In the middle sits a sparkling, unridden Harley\r\n          Davidson police bike.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 64.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wow. That's fantastic.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          You ride this?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Oh, no. The Hells Angels would take it\r\n          to pieces if they ever saw me on it. I\r\n          just keep it in here. Polish it and so\r\n          forth. But I'd never let them see it.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Those guys are that big of a problem,\r\n          huh?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Yeah. They ride into town a few times a\r\n          month and get drunk, damage property...\r\n          Basically turn the place upside down.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          And the police don't do anything?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Well, It's a small town - and me and the\r\n          Dooble brothers are the only law. And\r\n          they're still pretty green.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Can't you call a bigger town or something\r\n          for backup?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Yeah, I've done that a few times. But\r\n          the gang is always gone by the time they\r\n          get here. We've also tried wearing riot\r\n          gear, which does protect you from being\r\n          hit, but not from being dragged. Also,\r\n          one of the Dooble brothers tried to throw\r\n          tear gas, but the bottle exploded and\r\n          blew off his ear.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Ech.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Yeah, he's hard to look at.\r\n\r\n                         (THEN)\r\n          Anyway, we want you guys to stay at our\r\n          hotel tonight on us... Seeing as you're\r\n          the new town heroes and all.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 65.\r\n          The guys look flattered. Except Woody.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Oh, thanks, but we're actually moving on--\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO DUDLEY)\r\n          We'd be honored to stay. Thank you.\r\n          Woody's looks at Doug in protest. Doug gives him a stern\r\n          glare.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          And if you're not in a rush to leave in\r\n          the morning-- We've got a great trout\r\n          stream you might want to check out.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Cool! Let's fish!\r\n          Doug shrugs.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Sure. Let's do it.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Uh uh. No, I'm putting my foot down,\r\n          here. I still get a vote on what we do,\r\n          you know? And I want my vote.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Okay. Of course you get a vote.\r\n          Woody nods and looks at Bob and Dudley. They clearly\r\n          intend to stay.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I actually get three votes. Because I\r\n          planned the trip.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          But you didn't plan the voting system. I\r\n          did. So you only get one. Sorry.\r\n          Doug, Bob and Dudley walk off. Woody fumes.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You know what? Old Doug wasn't such a\r\n          douchebag!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 66.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BIKER BAR - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          MURDOCK has arrived at the bar, which is just a burned\r\n          shack at this point. The Hell's Angels are gathered\r\n          around, watching JACK beat the crap out of a remaining\r\n          wall with a pipe. He finally stops when the wall has\r\n          crumbled.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Those assholes think they can cross the\r\n          Hells Angels? Do you know how bad\r\n          they've made us all look!?\r\n          The gang nods. They all look pissed.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Those guys have some balls. Balls I will\r\n          put in my mouth and chew on!!\r\n          The gang looks at Jack with a slight smile. OILCAN\r\n          chuckles.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN\r\n          You're going to put balls in your mouth?\r\n          The gang laughs. Jack realizes what the joke is...\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          No! I'm not-- I'm going to put my foot\r\n          up their asses! Both feet! Hell, I'm\r\n          going to stick anything I can in their\r\n          asses, and I'm going to enlov it.\r\n          The guys start laughing again. Jack boils red.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Shut up!! I didn't mean-- Just get on\r\n          your damn bikes! We're riding to Lucas!\r\n          The guys start towards their bikes. Oilcan sidles up\r\n          next to Jack.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN\r\n          Sometimes it helps if you say things in\r\n          your mind first, then say it out loud,\r\n          you know?\r\n          Jack looks at Oilcan for a beat, then bends down, picks a\r\n          dart up out of the ash, and jabs it into his shoulder.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN (CONT'D)\r\n          Oww! Dammit!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 67.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          I did that in my mind, first.\r\n          Jack smiles calmly and walks off.\r\n\r\n          EXT. MAIN STREET HOTEL - THAT AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          DOUG, BOB, WOODY and DUDLEY exit out of an old fashioned\r\n          hotel next to the diner. They cross to the town square,\r\n          where the block party is in full swing. Townspeople\r\n          mingle around eating corn-on-the-cob and hotdogs. Up on\r\n          the stage, a plump, middle-aged man with a goatee and a\r\n          polo shirt tucked into dockers - sings Justin\r\n          Timberlake's \"Rock Your body.\"\r\n\r\n                         PLUMP MAN\r\n          So you grab your girls, And you grab a\r\n          couple more.\r\n          And you all come meet me, in the middle\r\n          of the floor.\r\n          Gonna rock your body! 'Till the break of\r\n\r\n                         DAY--\r\n          The man drops to his knees at the edge of stage and\r\n          reaches his hand out to the audience, like the star of a\r\n          boy band; However, it's clearly making the people on the\r\n          dance floor uncomfortable.\r\n          Meanwhile, Doug, Bob, Woody and Dudley walk through the\r\n          square and are instantly greeted, patted on the back and\r\n          thanked by each townsperson they pass. The word is out\r\n          that these guys are heroes. Doug gives a \"can you\r\n          believe this?\" look to the other guys - who are just as\r\n          thrilled as him. They're eating it up.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          These people love us. This is nuts.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Yeah. They think we're bad asses.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, let's not get too carried away with\r\n          it. The truth is we're just regular\r\n          guys. Let's not forget that.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Yeah, the best thing is to keep a low\r\n          profile. Don't cause any waves. Then if\r\n          somebody pushes us too far, Boom!

He once bit me on the\r\n          sack.\r\n          Dudley walks off towards the beer tent.

He was unclogging his bathtub\r\n          drain and the cat thought it was a ball\r\n          of yarn.\r\n          Doug and Woody wince.\r\n          ANGLE ON: DUDLEY, at the beer tent. He gets in line,\r\n          and realizes he's behind MAGGIE.

I like fig newtons.\r\n          Dudley collects himself and tries to speak.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Yeah. They're like fried chicken at a--\r\n          No, that's not... Dammit! This is hard.\r\n          Maggie smiles sweetly as Dudley fumbles.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          You want to dance?\r\n          Dudley goes to respond, then decides to just give an\r\n          emphatic nod. Maggie smiles.\r\n\r\n          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY are sitting at a picnic table,\r\n          drinking beer out of plastic cups. They lean back and\r\n          soak up the small town celebration around them. It's a\r\n          great night.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          It doesn't get any better than this, huh?\r\n          Bob notices Doug getting ready to chomp down on a piece\r\n          of garlic bread.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 70.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          That's a lot of carbs.\r\n          Doug stops, mid-bite, and puts the bread down.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Thanks, Bob. You saved me from all\r\n          that... buttery, garlicky flavor.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No he didn't.\r\n          Woody takes the garlic bread and crams it in his mouth.\r\n\r\n                          WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                          (MOUTH FULL)\r\n          I did.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I hope you choke on it.\r\n          CHARLEY approaches with his two deputies, EARL DOOBLE and\r\n          BUCK DOOBLE. They are chubby, thirty-year old twins -\r\n          identical in every way, except for the fact that Buck is\r\n          missing an ear on the right side of his head... which the\r\n          skin has scarred back over. It doesn't look good.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Howdy, guys! Welcome to the block party!\r\n          These are my deputies: Earl and Buck\r\n          Dooble.\r\n          Earl shakes the guys hands.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          I'm Earl and he's Buck. Just remember,\r\n          the brother with the word \"ear,\" in his\r\n          name, has both on his head.\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHS)\r\n          I can only say that because I'm on his\r\n          right side. Which as you can see, is\r\n          blown off.\r\n          Earl laughs again, as BUCK extends his hand - oblivious.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          I'm Buck and this is Earl. Good luck\r\n          telling us apart!\r\n          Buck laughs and turns to Charley, exposing his missing\r\n          ear to the guys. They draw back a little.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 71.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, it's nice to meet you guys. You've\r\n          got a great town here.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Yeah, we got everything here. Good\r\n          people, good fishing...\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          We do have convicted child molesters,\r\n          though. We have to disclose that.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Not if they don't have kids, Earl.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Just to be safe, though.\r\n          (yells at crowd of people)\r\n          Hey!! Thomas Milborn!\r\n          A bookish man with a tweed jacket turns around and looks.\r\n\r\n                         EARL (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (ANNOUNCING)\r\n          Convicted child molester.\r\n          Thomas Milborn nods glumly and pulls his hands out of his\r\n          pockets. The guys look at each other uneasily.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Well... Still a nice town.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          If you're not a kid.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Or Thomas Milborn.\r\n\r\n          ANGLE ON: DANCE FLOOR AREA:\r\n          DUDLEY is on the dance floor with MAGGIE. The middle\r\n          aged guy on stage is letting loose with a rendition of\r\n          Usher's \"Yeah.\" Maggie and Dudley dance conservatively\r\n          for a moment, but as the beat gets ahold of Dudley, he\r\n          starts getting into it. He starts spinning around at a\r\n          rapid pace, then drops to his knees, slaps the ground and\r\n          shakes his head to the music.\r\n          Maggie watches curiously as Dudley pulls himself along\r\n          the ground by his elbows - then springs up to his feet\r\n          and starts a move that resembles a sprinkler. Maggie\r\n          grins - actually amused by Dudley's rhythmic passion.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 72.\r\n          ANGLE ON: The Wild Hog's table. The guys sit with\r\n          Charley, Buck and Earl - watching Dudley with a curious\r\n          look.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Looks like your friend and Maggie are\r\n          hitting it off.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. I think he really likes that girl.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Well, Maggie's a great woman.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Yup. Big cans, too. Buck liked her, but\r\n          you know... He's a deformed freak.\r\n          Buck, on Earl's left, stares out at Maggie and Dudley,\r\n          deaf to the conversation.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          I used to like that girl... but then I\r\n          realized, I can do better.\r\n          The guys look at Buck.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          So, why are you guys taking this road\r\n          trip, anyway?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Ahh, just to escape for a bit.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Hey, we're not escaping anything, man.\r\n          We're on this trip to live.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          I know what you mean. Sometimes things\r\n          in life can bother you, and sometimes\r\n          nothing in life can bother you. Either\r\n          way, you've got take a break from it.\r\n          Happiness is somewhere between boredom\r\n          and stress.\r\n          Doug is surprised at Charley's insight. So is Woody.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Exactly. Which is why we need to keep\r\n          riding until we figure out where that\r\n          happiness is. You don't get old Doug\r\n          back by just staying put.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 73.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Old Doug?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. Apparently I've lost him. I don't\r\n          sing Bon Jovi anymore.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You did lose him, Doug. You know why?\r\n          You're housebroken. You're too\r\n          comfortable. You've got to snap out of\r\n          it!\r\n          Doug nods halfheartedly. He knows woody might be right.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n\r\n                         (TO DOUG)\r\n          Woody's got a point, there. Comfortable\r\n          can be a bad thing. You have to wake up\r\n          and slap the bull once in a while.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Right! Slap the bull!\r\n          (then, to Charley)\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Slapping the bull is kind of the local\r\n          test of manhood. It's a way to prove you\r\n          aren't controlled by fear. We've all\r\n          done it.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Yup. Even torn-open head, here.\r\n          He nods at Buck, on his left.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          You know, I slapped the bull once.\r\n          Woody smiles slyly. Doug looks concerned.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          We're slapping the bull.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I don't think we need to. I mean, we can\r\n          have our own test of manhood. Let's see\r\n          how many ears of corn we can eat or\r\n          something. I'll start.\r\n          Doug grabs an ear of corn and takes a bite, but Woody\r\n          just grins with that reckless look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 74.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          We are slapping the bull.\r\n          Doug knows it's no use. He nods, defeated.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. COW PASTURE - THAT EVENING\r\n\r\n          DOUG, BOB, WOODY, CHARLEY, BUCK and EARL approach a fence\r\n          surrounding a pasture. Charley smiles.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Here we are. The Lucas test of manhood.\r\n          Slap the bull.\r\n          Charley gestures to a lone bull grazing in the pasture.\r\n          He's a frighteningly large bull with enormous horns.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Wow. So it's literally slapping a bull?\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          Yup. Right on the ass. Then high-tail\r\n          it out of there, because he can kill ya.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wow. Um... Woody? This was your idea,\r\n          so... go ahead.\r\n          Woody nods.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          All right. I'm going in.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG / BOB\r\n          You are?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Hell yeah. I'm gonna slap the shit out\r\n          of that bull. Like, pimp-style.\r\n          The guys look at him, surprised and somewhat impressed.\r\n          Woody takes a breath and climbs over the fence. He\r\n          approaches the Bull very quietly and cautiously. He gets\r\n          within three feet of it, leans in and slaps the Bull hard\r\n          on the ass.\r\n          The bull makes an annoyed sound and turns around, but\r\n          Woody is already hightailing it back to the fence, with\r\n          an exhilarated look on his face.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 75.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Whhhheeeeeeew!\r\n          Woody gets to the fence and hurls himself over. The guys\r\n          all applaud.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Yes! Wow! That felt so good. I just\r\n          slapped a big fat bull right on his ass!\r\n          Did you hear how pissed he was!? I just\r\n          pissed of a bull!\r\n          (back to Bull)\r\n          Bitch!\r\n          Woody high fives all the guys.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          All right. I'm in. I'm slapping that\r\n          bull.\r\n          The guys cheer as Doug climbs over the fence and starts\r\n          heading towards the Bull. The group all leans on the\r\n          fence, watching.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (TO CHARLEY)\r\n          Thanks for bringing us out here. Doug\r\n          really needs this.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Yeah. This is good for him.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Sure. Glad we could help.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          Yeah, and we've never seen it done twice\r\n          in a row. It'll be interesting to see\r\n          how the bull takes being slapped now that\r\n          he's alert.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY / BOB\r\n          Alert?\r\n          Woody and Bob look at each other, then to the Bull -\r\n          which Doug is about to slap.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Doug, wait!\r\n          It's too late. Doug slaps the bull hard, and turns to\r\n          run.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 76.\r\n\r\n                          DOUG\r\n          Wheeeeew!! Yeah!\r\n          Doug runs across the field, but the Bull - now fully\r\n          alert - swivels with magnificent agility and breaks into\r\n          an angry charge towards Doug.\r\n          The guys all watch in horror as the Bull quickly gains on\r\n          Doug. Doug sees the fear on the guys faces and looks\r\n          back over his shoulder. His smile quickly turns to\r\n          terror.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Ahhhhhhhh!\r\n          It's too late. The Bull catches Doug and bucks him into\r\n          the air. Doug flies ten feet and comes crashing down on\r\n          the muddy grass. The Bull takes a few steps back and\r\n          starts lining up another charge at him.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Oh, no you don't!\r\n          Woody jumps over the fence and runs into the field.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Heeeeey! Hey you! Come get me, Bull!\r\n          The Bull notices Woody and starts to Charge him.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Run, Doug! Go!\r\n          Doug climbs to his feet and sees the bull charging Woody.\r\n          Woody realizes he's in trouble and starts to run again.\r\n          The bull quickly catches him and rams him into the air.\r\n          Woody lands hard, with a grunt.\r\n          The bull turns back to charge at Woody again, and Bob\r\n          jumps over the fence.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Hey! Leave him alone! You want some of\r\n          this!? Come get this!\r\n          Bob sprints out into the field. The bull snorts and\r\n          starts towards him. The Bull closes on Bob quick, but at\r\n          the last moment Bob dives of the way. The bull goes\r\n          flying past him.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n          Hah! Missed me, you fat bastard!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 77.\r\n          Doug and Woody look impressed as Bob helps them hurry\r\n          towards the fence. Charley and Buck hold a gate open for\r\n          them as the Bull makes a turn and lines the group up, but\r\n          they've already made it to the gate. They go through and\r\n          Charley shuts it behind them. They lean back on the\r\n          fence, trying to gather their bearings, except Bob - who\r\n          is thrilled.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n          Did you see me? I dodged him! I dodged\r\n          that stupid cow! How cool am--\r\n          Suddenly, the Bull charges into the fence, which Bob's\r\n          butt is sticking through. Bob goes flying and lands face\r\n          down in the dirt. He scrambles back up, furious.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n          You son of a bitch! You want to keep it\r\n          going!? You want to take cheap shots!?\r\n          Come on!\r\n          Bob tries to climb back into the pasture, but the guys\r\n          restrain him.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO CHARLEY)\r\n          Give me your gun!

Doug\r\n          and Woody start to laugh. Bob cools off for another\r\n          moment, then starts laughing as well.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No this is living!\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We just slapped the bull!\r\n          The group high fives each other in congratulations, and\r\n          starts away: Bruised, muddy and laughing.\r\n          ANGLE ON: THE BULL. He pushes on the gate that Charley\r\n          was holding open. The gate swings open.\r\n          ANGLE ON: WOODY, BOB and DOUG. They walk with Charley\r\n          and the Dooble brothers, laughing and carrying on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 78.\r\n          Bob does an impression of how he dodged it and goes for\r\n          some more high fives - but suddenly, the bull charges\r\n          into frame and nails him. As Bob goes flying; we:\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. TOWN SQUARE / BLOCK PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT\r\n\r\n          The block party is winding down. Dudley is sitting by\r\n          himself at a picnic table, in post-Maggie bliss.\r\n          DOUG, WOODY and BOB approach, dirty and beaten from the\r\n          bull - but, carrying on happily.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Man, did you see the look on Bob's face\r\n          when he got up?

Bob looks pissed.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          I'm going to go back there with a rifle\r\n          tomorrow and shoot one of his legs off.\r\n          Then we'll see who's tough.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (LAUGHING)\r\n          Why just one leg?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Because I want to kick him in the face.\r\n          Doug and Woody laugh again. Bob just steams. They spot\r\n          DUDLEY, and head over to him.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, Dud. You look happy.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I danced with her.

Doug looks down the street\r\n          and sees: THE HELLS ANGELS. All forty of them are\r\n          riding into town - and the guys will be in their view any\r\n          second. Woody is frozen with fear.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Are you kidding me? Woody, you're going\r\n          to have to talk to these guys again.

Woody looks around\r\n          desperately for somewhere to hide - but the Hells Angels\r\n          are too close. There's no time. Woody spots a port-o-\r\n          potty from the block party and starts corralling Doug,\r\n          Bob and Dudley into it.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Go! Go!

I thought I had time!\r\n          Dudley sits on the fountain edge and starts to tear up.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (TO GUYS)\r\n          I'm sorry, okay!\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Sorry? That's it!? You're sorry!?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yes, I'm sorry! I just didn't want us to\r\n          go back.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Why?

Woody looks away - trying to\r\n          collect himself. After a moment, he faces them.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          I've lost everything. The firm fired me,\r\n          Claudia left me... It's all gone. My\r\n          whole life is gone. I don't even have\r\n          enough money to get my lawn raked\r\n          anymore.\r\n          Doug, Bob and Dudley are stupefied. Woody takes a deep\r\n          breath and continues.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          That's why I couldn't go back. This\r\n          isn't a vacation for me, it's the only\r\n          thing I have left. There's nothing more\r\n          in my life but you guys. So, I lied\r\n          about the Hells Angels. I lied because I\r\n          wanted to have one thing in my life that\r\n          wasn't a complete failure. A real trip\r\n          with my best friends... You're all I\r\n          got. I'm sorry.\r\n          Woody lowers his head. The guys take this in for a\r\n          minute. Woody looks at them, waiting for their sympathy.\r\n          Finally, Doug speaks.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          (realizing, to Woody)\r\n          This trip is just you running from your\r\n          life.

You asshole!\r\n          Woody's puppy-dog face dissolves.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Fine! I see how important I am to you\r\n          guys. That's just fine. I just thought\r\n          being a \"Wild Hog\" meant something!\r\n          Woody takes off his \"Wild Hogs\" jacket and throws it at\r\n          their feet. He hops out of the fountain and storms off\r\n          down the street.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 85.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          It doesn't mean anything! It's just a\r\n          patch my wife made!!\r\n          Doug, Bob and Dudley look at each other. After a moment,\r\n          they look over to the sidewalk and see:\r\n          ALL THE TOWNSPEOPLE, staring at them in disappointed\r\n          silence. Slowly, the townspeople turn and quietly head\r\n          back to their homes. Doug, Bob and Dudley lower their\r\n          heads in disgrace.

MAIN STREET DINER - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          The Hells Angels have returned, and set up shop in the\r\n          diner, but are also flowing out onto the street. Jack\r\n          stumbles into the middle of the road, with a bottle of\r\n          tequila in his hand.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (YELLING OUT)\r\n          Alright, Wild Hogs.

I was thinking of that for us.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          You guys just stay in the station\r\n          tonight.

Why don't you go\r\n          out there?\r\n          Charley is visibly hurt.

Sure, I\r\n          make comments about \"chum face,\" here.\r\n          But that's because every time I look at\r\n          him I see parts of his brain. But nobody\r\n          has the right to hurt Charley like that.\r\n          He has both sides of his head.\r\n          Earl storms off, leaving BUCK, who was standing on his\r\n          left and hasn't heard or seen any of them leave.

POLICE STATION - NEXT MORNING\r\n\r\n          Doug wakes up on a cot in an open jail cell. He walks\r\n          out of the cell, and over to the window.\r\n          ANGLE ON: The Main Street Diner: The Hells Angels bikes\r\n          are still parked outside, and the bikers appear to be\r\n          passed out in various booths, chairs, and the street out\r\n          front.\r\n          BACK ON: The police station. Dudley and Bob approach\r\n          the window.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          They're still out there. Passed out.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Well, I talked to Karen. She going to\r\n          fly out here, rent a mini-van, and pick\r\n          us up.

PARK - A MOMENT LATER\r\n\r\n          Doug walks through the park, looking depressed. He\r\n          passes through a small playground, and has a seat on a\r\n          bench. He watches all the children play, and his eyes\r\n          fall on four young boys happily riding their bicycles\r\n          together. They have cards in their spokes, making engine\r\n          sounds as they ride around having a great time together.\r\n          Doug smiles and watches them play together.\r\n\r\n          FADE OUT MUSIC CUE\r\n\r\n          BUD (O.C.)\r\n          Thought you might be out here.\r\n          Doug turns and sees BUD, the owner of the diner, Bud has\r\n          a seat next to him.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, Bud.

That's why I stopped\r\n          singing Bon Jovi. Life used to be a\r\n          risk. That was old Doug. And now it's\r\n          gone.

Angry bikers.\r\n          That's not something you should be\r\n          avoiding. That's something you need.\r\n          Doug takes this in.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          What's that have to do with worms?\r\n\r\n                         BUD\r\n          Go down to the lake and find out.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 91.\r\n          Bud smiles and walks off. Doug looks down at the worms,\r\n          considering...\r\n\r\n          EXT. LAKE - LATER\r\n\r\n          Doug walks up to the shore and sees Woody, trying to push\r\n          a canoe towards the water. Woody notices Doug.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Hey.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey. Going fishing?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yup.\r\n          Woody gets the canoe to the water and looks back at Doug.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I've got worms.\r\n\r\n                         (BEAT)\r\n          I mean, in here.\r\n          Doug holds up the styrofoam cup. Woody shrugs.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          All right. Let's go.\r\n          Doug helps Woody shove the boat out into the water. They\r\n          both hop in as it floats away from the shore. They sit\r\n          there staring off in silence.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Um... Look, man. I'm sorry about\r\n          Claudia. And the job.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (STARING OFF)\r\n          Thanks.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          But, you shouldn't have lied to us--\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You know what? I screwed up! It\r\n          happens. Maybe from now on I'm better\r\n          off just doing things on my own!\r\n          Woody starts to get up, but then looks at the water\r\n          around him, and sits.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 92.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You would have stormed off right then,\r\n          huh?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (DEFLATED)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n          Doug nods and looks out at the water. They sit there in\r\n          silence for another moment.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          I didn't want to lose, Doug. I've lost\r\n          everything else and I didn't want to lose\r\n          this trip with you guys. When we're\r\n          together, it's like we're all college\r\n          kids still. I'm not a guy with a broken\r\n          marriage and failed career. I'm just\r\n          with my best friends, being happy. And\r\n          to keep it going, I forgot about what\r\n          made it so great... That friends never\r\n          let each other down. Until now. I\r\n          screwed up the last thing I had left.\r\n          You guys deserve better. I'm sorry--\r\n          Woody eyes water a little and he quickly turns away from\r\n          Doug. They sit there for another moment.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Well, what's the point of being in a\r\n          motorcycle gang if we can't ourselves in\r\n          a little trouble?\r\n          Woody looks back at him. Doug smiles a little bit.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          It'll be okay, man.\r\n          Woody smiles a little as well.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          They won't kill us, right? Just a...\r\n          really bad beating.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. We won't die. I don't think.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No way. And how much could a punch\r\n          really hurt?

That'll be cool.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Let's go find the Bob and Dudley.\r\n          Doug looks around the canoe for a paddle.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Did you bring the paddles?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          No. I wasn't even going to take this\r\n          thing out, but I didn't want you to think\r\n          I was just standing at the lake waiting\r\n          for you.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Why were you here?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Bud told me to stand at the lake and wait\r\n          for you.\r\n          Doug nods. Bob walks up on the shore, holding a\r\n          styrofoam cup.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Hey, guys.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, Bob. Worms?\r\n          Bob looks at the styrofoam cup and nods.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Are we all good?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yeah, Bob. We're all good.\r\n          Woody smiles at Doug.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          Throw us that paddle.\r\n          Bob nods and picks up a paddle. He throws it toward the\r\n          canoe, but it lands ten yards short and sinks.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Shit. Hold on.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 94.\r\n          Bob grabs another paddle and throws it. This time it\r\n          lands even shorter. Bob looks around for another paddle.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Were those the only two paddles?\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n\r\n                         (BUMMED)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Oh.\r\n          Bob sits down on the grass.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          You guys'll drift in.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (BUMMED)\r\n          Yeah.\r\n          Woody and Doug look around at the water. It's as still\r\n          as glass. They sit there awkwardly as Bob waits on\r\n          shore.\r\n\r\n          INT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\r\n\r\n          A cook from the diner is at the kitchen stove, making\r\n          something in a big pot, as a crowd of townspeople eat in\r\n          the kitchen and dining room. MAGGIE and DUDLEY cross\r\n          through the kitchen, and out to the front porch.\r\n\r\n          EXT. BUD AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\n          Maggie sits on the porch swing and takes a breath.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          Well, we can't seat many people in there,\r\n          but at least we're back in business.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Sorry those jerks are in your diner.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          Ah, we're used to them costing us money.\r\n          Last year we spent more on window glass\r\n          than pancake batter. All because of\r\n          them.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 95.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          It makes me sick. Thinking they're too\r\n          good for pancakes.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          No, I meant... They damage the diner a\r\n          lot. They damage the whole town. I'm\r\n          just sorry you guys got dragged into it.\r\n          You were just out to have a good\r\n          vacation.\r\n          Dudley looks at Maggie sincerely.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          This has been the best vacation of my\r\n          life. I met you.\r\n          Maggie blushes.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          You bikers probably tell all the girls\r\n          that.\r\n          This hits Dudley. He suddenly looks troubled.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Maggie, I have to tell you something.\r\n          I'm not really a cool biker or a cool...\r\n          anything. I'm a computer programmer. A\r\n          nerd. My cat doesn't even like me. She\r\n          watches me sleep and I don't know why. I\r\n          think she's waiting for me to stop\r\n          breathing. I'm just a... Geek. I'm\r\n          sorry if you thought I was somebody I'm\r\n          not.\r\n          Maggie takes this in. After a moment, she smiles and\r\n          kisses Dudley.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE\r\n          You're not a geek, Dudley. You're sweet\r\n          and your honest and... You're the\r\n          coolest guy I know. Your cat is crazy if\r\n          it doesn't like you as much as I do.\r\n          Dudley smiles. He has completely fallen for her.\r\n\r\n                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)\r\n          Well, I better get back inside. I've got\r\n          to set some chairs up in the family room\r\n          for the lunch rush. People gotta eat.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 96.\r\n          Maggie smiles and heads inside. Dudley watches her go,\r\n          then grits his teeth.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Oh, people will eat. Don't you worry,\r\n          Maggie. People will eat.\r\n\r\n          SMASH CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          INT. MAIN STREET DINER - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          DUDLEY kicks open the front door. JACK and the other\r\n          Hells Angels are inside, drinking and carrying on.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Alright, let's end this!\r\n          The Hells Angels don't even notice him. Dudley bites his\r\n          lip in frustration.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (YELLS)\r\n          Hey! !\r\n          Dudley takes a table full of empty beer glasses and flips\r\n          it over. Everyone in the diner goes silent and looks at\r\n          him. Jack stands up and smiles.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Well, well. One of you came to face the\r\n          music, huh? That's brave. And stupid.\r\n          The Hells Angels laugh. Dudley takes a deep breath and\r\n          walks up to Jack.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          I'm not here to face any music. I'm here\r\n          to make you a deal. A deal I think you'd\r\n          be smart to take.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Yeah? What deal?\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          You leave the town of Lucas, and my\r\n          friends alone, and I do something for\r\n          you. Something you can't live without.\r\n          Jack looks interested. Dudley confidently sets a laptop\r\n          on the counter, and punches a few keys. He swivels it\r\n          around to show the gang.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 97.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          See where that says \"Domain for sale?\"\r\n          Guess what that means. Your gang doesn't\r\n          have a website! Nothing! No way to tell\r\n          people about your history, post photos,\r\n          sell shirts... You guys are living in\r\n          the complete dark ages!\r\n          (laughs cockily, then)\r\n          So they way I see it: I need a favor\r\n          from you and you need a favor from me.\r\n          Jack walks over to the computer and looks at Dudley for a\r\n          moment. He then picks the computer up and smashes it\r\n          down on the ground. It breaks into a hundred pieces.\r\n          Jack smiles at Dudley and puts his foot through what's\r\n          left of it. The Hells Angels stifle laughter. Dudley is\r\n          starting to look a little nervous.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (TO DUDLEY)\r\n          No deal.\r\n          Dudley nods.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Okay, then. Thanks for hearing me out.\r\n          Dudley starts for the door, but several Hells Angels move\r\n          over and block his path. Dudley stops and collects\r\n          himself for a moment - then breaks into a panicked sprint\r\n          for the other exit.

And once they know we're\r\n          afraid, they can do whatever they want.\r\n          That's how these guys exist. That's how\r\n          they ride into this town and tear it to\r\n          pieces... Because people want to keep\r\n          their lives safe so badly, they give up\r\n          the best part about it...\r\n          Doug takes his Wild Hogs jacket and pulls it on.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          .The adventure.\r\n          Doug looks at Woody and Bob. Woody smiles and pulls on\r\n          his jacket.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 105.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          And the friends.\r\n          Woody steps over to Doug. Bob looks at them for a\r\n          moment, then finally smiles and pulls on his jacket.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Let's go slap the bull.\r\n          Doug smiles and taps fists with Bob and Woody.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER\r\n\r\n\r\n          MUSIC CUE: BLUE OYSTER CULT'S \"(DON'T FEAR) THE REAPER.\"\r\n          DOUG, BOB and WOODY walk along main street, shoulder to\r\n          shoulder. They look to each other with a smile. Even\r\n          though they're walking into the mouth of the beast,\r\n          they're finally who they were in college again.\r\n          Fearless. They approach the diner and stand out on the\r\n          street, like gunslingers in the Old West, calling their\r\n          enemy out of the saloon.\r\n\r\n          MUSIC CUE: FADE OUT\r\n          The front door of the bar opens and the HELLS ANGELS\r\n          swagger out. After a moment, the gang parts and JACK\r\n          steps out in front of them.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Well, well. The \"Wild Hogs.\" I'm glad\r\n          to see you're finally showing us a little\r\n          respect.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Where's Dudley?\r\n          Jack turns back and nods at one of the Hells Angels.\r\n          They push DUDLEY forward. We see he is now completely\r\n          cocooned in duct-tape - like a mummy. There is only a\r\n          small slit for his mouth and eyes.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          (muffled from tape)\r\n          Hey, guyth.\r\n          Doug shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Just hold tight, Dudley.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 106.\r\n          Dudley tries to nod, but can't. He leans his torso back\r\n          and forth to signal \"yes.\"\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JACK)\r\n          All right. Hand him over.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Sure. Where's the cash?\r\n          Doug looks to Bob and Woody. They nod encouragingly.\r\n          Doug gathers his courage and turns back to Jack.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We're not giving you any money.\r\n          Jack looks surprised.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Excuse me?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We're not going to play your games.\r\n          We're all adults, here. It's not\r\n          highschool. I'm sorry your bar got\r\n          burned down, and we'll be glad to help\r\n          you get it rebuilt, but we're done being\r\n          bullied by you. Now give us back Dudley,\r\n          and get out of this town.\r\n          The Hells Angels start to laugh. Jack turns back to them\r\n          and smiles, \"Can you believe these guys?\" Doug is\r\n          starting to lose his cool.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          (yells to Jack)\r\n          Give us back our friend, asshole!\r\n          The Hells Angels are suddenly silent. Jack turns back\r\n          and looks at Doug in disbelief - then rage. Doug starts\r\n          to look a little worried.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What did you just call me?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          (losing some confidence)\r\n          Ass... hole.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          You know what? I was just going to\r\n          pulverize your friend, here.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 107.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          But now I'm pissed off. You're all going\r\n          to get hurt. Hells Angels style. Guys!\r\n          The Hells Angles nod and pick up various weapons:\r\n          Crowbars, tire irons, bats... They start moving towards\r\n          Doug, Woody and Bob. Bob looks to Doug.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          What!? I thought they'd back down!\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          We can still outrun them. They're fat.\r\n          Woody turns around to see Hells Angles have now closed in\r\n          behind them, blocking their escape. Jack smiles.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Hear that, guys!? He called you all fat!\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          shit.\r\n          (to Hells Angels)\r\n          I meant full-figured.\r\n          The Hells Angels close to within a few feet of the \"Wild\r\n          Hogs,\" and raise their weapons to strike.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wait!! Wait a minute!\r\n          The Hells Angels stop.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JACK)\r\n          You want to beat the shit out of us?\r\n          Fine. But you outnumber us forty to\r\n          three. You think there's honor in that?\r\n          Why don't we make it fair, if you guys\r\n          are so freaking tough? The leader of our\r\n          gang against the leader of yours.\r\n          Jack smirks. He's twice as big as Doug.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Me against you?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. But not just for Dudley. If you\r\n          win, we'll give you ten grand and go back\r\n          home. You'll never see us again. But...\r\n          If I win, you let Dudley go and you never\r\n          set foot in Lucas again. This town is\r\n          off limits to the Hells Angels. Forever.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 108.\r\n          Jack looks back to the Hells Angels, who chuckle. This\r\n          will be a quick fight.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Well? You in, or are you too much of a\r\n          bitch?\r\n          The Hells Angels freeze. Jack grits his teeth in rage\r\n          and turns back to Doug.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          All right. Let's party, tough guy.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Great.\r\n          Doug nods, trying to look confidant, but it's quickly\r\n          fading away.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (UNSURE)\r\n          Great.\r\n\r\n                         CUT TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. TOWN SQUARE - A FEW MINUTES LATER\r\n\r\n          DOUG and JACK are standing \"in their corners,\" opposite\r\n          each other in the dirt parking lot. They're surrounded\r\n          by a circle of Hells Angels, rowdily waiting for the\r\n          fight to commence. WOODY and BOB coach Doug in his\r\n          corner.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Just stay clear of the big punches.\r\n          You've got more stamina than this guy.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          All right. When do I hit back?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Um... Just try and get him tired. I\r\n          don't think punches will do much to him.\r\n          Doug gives Woody a concerned look. Woody shrugs. Jack\r\n          steps into the circle and throws off his jacket.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (CALLING OUT)\r\n          Time for your beating, yuppie!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          7/06/05 109.\r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          Tell my wife I won - then got hit by a\r\n          truck.\r\n          Doug takes a deep breath and starts into the circle.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (TO JACK)\r\n          All right. Let's do this--\r\n          Doug doesn't even finish his sentence as Jack lands a\r\n          punch on the side of his head. Doug is stunned, as Jack\r\n          sends his other fist crashing into Doug's forehead. Doug\r\n          goes flying backwards, and falls down in the dirt. The\r\n          Hells Angels cheer. Jack high fives them as Doug\r\n          struggles back to his feet and looks back at Woody and\r\n          Bob, cradling his face.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Ow! Dammit Jesus that hurt!\r\n\r\n                         (TO WOODY)\r\n          It really hurts. Damn!\r\n          Jack comes back over to Doug. Jack throws another right,\r\n          but this time Doug ducks, still cradling his jaw.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Yes!--\r\n          But Doug is instantly punched in the stomach by Jack's\r\n          other fist. Doug winces as he doubles over in agony.\r\n          Drool drips out of his mouth. This isn't pretty.\r\n          Jack takes him by the back of the shirt and lifts him\r\n          into the air. The Hells Angels cheer as Jack tosses Doug\r\n          five yards into the dirt.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Don't get tired yet. The hurt is just\r\n          beginning.\r\n          Doug tries to stand back up, but it's getting harder. He\r\n          slyly grabs a handful of sand as he starts to stand.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hah!\r\n          Doug whips around and throws the sand towards Jack's\r\n          face; However, his aim is off. The sand hits Jack in the\r\n          chest and falls away. Jack looks at Doug and shakes his\r\n          head.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 110.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Damn.\r\n          Jack punches Doug square in the face again. Doug\r\n          crumples to the ground in pain. Jack turns back to the\r\n          Hells Angels.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Man, this isn't even a workout.\r\n          Jack laughs and puts his aviator sunglasses back on, as\r\n          Doug quickly stands up and whips around at him.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Ahhh!\r\n          Doug throws another handful of sand. This time he aims\r\n          carefully; but Jack now has sunglasses on. The sand\r\n          bounces harmlessly off the lenses. Doug cringes and\r\n          waits for the punch, which comes like a freight train\r\n          into his stomach. Doug doubles over again as Jack lines\r\n          up another punch.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          This one's gonna break bone.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wait! Wait--\r\n          Doug straightens up and looks curiously at Jack's mouth.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          Your tooth-- That's an acute periodontal\r\n          abscess.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          look, I really hate you, but I don't want\r\n          to feel responsible for a death. I'm a\r\n          dentist. I took an oath. Same one as\r\n          doctors. If the infection in that tooth\r\n          gets to the root - it could seep into\r\n          your nervous system. Just let me look--\r\n          Doug slowly reaches towards Jack's mouth. Jack doesn't\r\n          move.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          You're a dentist?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 111.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Yeah. One of the best. And I know when\r\n          your gums are that swollen and your\r\n\r\n                         BICUSPID--\r\n          And Wham! Doug punches Jack square in the mouth. Jack\r\n          goes down hard. Woody and Bob cheer.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Yeah, Doug!\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Quick! Start kicking him! Don't let him\r\n          get up!\r\n          Doug nods and goes to kick Jack, but Jack grabs the foot\r\n          and pushes him backwards. Doug falls back to the dirt.\r\n          Jack stands up and dusts himself off.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          All right. Now you're going to die.\r\n          Jack approaches Doug, who closes his eyes and waits for\r\n          the end.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Wait!!\r\n          Jack turns around as WOODY walks into the circle.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY (CONT'D)\r\n          Doug's not the leader of this gang. I--\r\n          Jack instantly punches Woody in the face. Woody falls\r\n          down next to Doug. Doug turns his head to Woody.\r\n          They're both bleeding from their noses and lips.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO WOODY)\r\n          Thanks, man.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Sure.\r\n          Jack looks at Bob.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Anybody else the leader of this gang?\r\n          Bob takes a deep breath, and bends down an grabs a long\r\n          lead pipe. He starts towards Jack.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 112.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          Alright, Mother f--\r\n          Bob suddenly trips on the lead pipe and hits the ground.\r\n          Doug shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          Just stay down.\r\n          Bob nods.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Well, I guess that's all of you--\r\n          DUDLEY, still covered in tape, comes running into the\r\n          circle from the other side.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Ahhhhhhhhhhh!\r\n          Dudley charges Jack, but his limited mobility results not\r\n          in a tackle, but in him leaning on Jack. After a moment,\r\n          Jack takes a step back and Dudley falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Ow.\r\n          Jack cracks his knuckles and looks to OILCAN.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Give me the crowbar.\r\n          Oilcan nods and hands it to Jack. Jack smiles at the\r\n          four fallen Wild Hogs.\r\n\r\n                         JACK (CONT'D)\r\n          Guess you guys are wishing you'd\r\n          listened, now, huh?\r\n          Jack smiles as we hear:\r\n\r\n                         SFX: SIREN\r\n          Jack and the Hells Angels look up the road.\r\n          ANGLE ON: DOWN STREET. CHARLEY is riding his shiny\r\n          Harley Davidson police bike. Behind him are BUCK and\r\n          EARL, driving a police cruiser. Behind the cruiser is a\r\n          large group of people carrying rakes, hedge clippers,\r\n          brooms... It's all the citizens of Lucas.\r\n          ANGLE ON: Hells Angels. They're stunned.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 113.\r\n          CHARLEY pulls up to the group and gets off his\r\n          motorcycle.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          All right, Jack. That'll be enough of\r\n          that.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Are you kidding? And what makes you\r\n          think you can ride a motorcycle without\r\n          our permission?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          I'll ride whatever I want from now on.\r\n          I'm the sheriff of Lucas, and I'm not\r\n          tolerating any more lawlessness.\r\n          BOB helps DOUG, WOODY, and DUDLEY to their feet, as Jack\r\n          takes a step towards Charley.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          I'd stop right there, Jack.\r\n          Earl and Buck get out of the cruiser with two shotguns.\r\n          They cock the guns and walk to Charley's side. Jack\r\n          looks concerned.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          What? You're going to shoot us?\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          No. Not unless you want to do something\r\n          stupid like ignoring--\r\n          Buck grabs his missing ear as he starts to loose his\r\n          balance. He tips over and falls. As he hits the ground,\r\n          the shotgun fires and hits OILCAN in the leg. Oilcan\r\n          falls to the ground.\r\n\r\n                         OILCAN\r\n          Ahhhhhh! He shot me! I just got shot!!\r\n          Charley looks over at Buck, then back to Jack.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Um... Yeah, I guess we're going to shoot\r\n          you.\r\n          The Hells Angels suddenly look nervous, and back up a few\r\n          steps. Charley steps towards Jack.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 114.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          We're not going to live in fear of your\r\n          gang anymore, Jack. If the Wild Hogs can\r\n          stand up to you - so can everyone of us.\r\n          The crowd of townspeople gathers behind Charley and nods.\r\n\r\n                         BUD\r\n\r\n                         (FROM CROWD)\r\n          That's right. You mess up our town,\r\n          we'll do the same to you!\r\n          The crowd cheers as THOMAS MILBORN, the guy Earl pointed\r\n          out as a child molester, steps forward.\r\n\r\n                         THOMAS MILBORN\r\n          Yeah! People like you are the scum of\r\n          the earth!\r\n          The crowd is silent for a moment, then hesitantly gives a\r\n          uncomfortable cheer. Charley turns back to the Hells\r\n          Angels.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          The point is, from now on you need to\r\n          treat Lucas with kindness and respect.\r\n          And when you do, you'll be treated the\r\n          same. And if you don't...\r\n          Charley looks over at OILCAN, who's tending to the bullet\r\n          wound in his thigh.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Then I guess we'll keep... shooting you.\r\n          Got it?\r\n          Jack looks at all the townspeople. He knows he's beaten.\r\n          He nods bitterly.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Good. Now I'd like you to untape our\r\n          friend Dudley.\r\n          Jack signals to one of the Hells Angels. He grabs\r\n          Dudley's tape and spins him around to untape him.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Ow. Ow! Ow, ow. Ow. Ow!...\r\n          After a painful minute, Dudley is untaped. Charley looks\r\n          at Jack's jacket.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 115.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          And I believe that's his jacket.\r\n          Jack begrudgingly takes off Dudley's \"Wild Hogs\" jacket\r\n          and tosses it to him. Dudley proudly puts it on.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          And as I recall, that '51 Panhead was\r\n          traded to Dudley.\r\n          Jack looks over at the mint condition motorcycle and\r\n          shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          No way. He can have his Sportster back.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Uh uh. A deal's a deal, Jack.\r\n          Jack grits his teeth and throws a set of keys at Dudley.\r\n          The crowd chatters in approval as Dudley gets on the '51\r\n          Panhead and starts the engine. He revs it a few times\r\n          and Jack shoots Doug an infuriated glare.\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n\r\n                         (TO DOUG)\r\n          Hope you're happy. You suburban posers\r\n          are a disease. You need to learn some\r\n          damn respect for real bikers.\r\n          Doug smiles.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You still don't get it do you, Jack?\r\n\r\n                         JACK\r\n          Get what?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          We are the real bikers.\r\n          As Doug says this, Dudley kicks the Panhead into gear and\r\n          shoots forward - out of control. He instantly crashes\r\n          into a steel light post. Everyone in the crowd cringes\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY LOOKS\r\n          as the bike falls over in a crumpled heap.\r\n          up from the ground.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Yeah, I'll take the Sportster back, I\r\n          guess.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 116.\r\n          Jack just stares at the trashed motorcycle, mortified.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION - LATER THAT AFTERNOON\r\n\r\n          It's later that afternoon in Lucas. DOUG, BOB and WOODY\r\n          walk to their motorcycles with CHARLEY, EARL and BUCK.\r\n\r\n                         CHARLEY\r\n          Well, I wish you guys would stay longer.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Ahh, we should be heading back. I think\r\n          we've had enough excitement for one trip.\r\n          Earl steps forward and shakes Doug's hand.\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n          You guys were a blessing to this place.\r\n          I mean... I'm not going to get all\r\n          emotional like \"hamburger head\" here\r\n          always does.\r\n          Earl laughs and looks to his left. Buck isn't there. He\r\n          quickly looks to the right, where Buck is staring at him\r\n          in disbelief.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          What'd you just call me?\r\n\r\n                         EARL\r\n\r\n                         (CAUGHT)\r\n          Um...\r\n\r\n                         BUCK\r\n          It's just a little scar! I'm still\r\n          better looking than you!\r\n          Buck goes to storm off, but after a few steps, tilts left\r\n          and falls over.\r\n\r\n                         BUCK (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (FROM GROUND)\r\n          Dammit!\r\n          Doug shakes his head, then turns to Woody and Bob.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          (to Woody and Bob)\r\n          You guys ready to head back?\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 117.\r\n          Woody takes a deep breath and shakes his head.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          You know what? I think I'm going to\r\n          press on. Keep heading West.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You are?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          Yeah. Why not? I feel good about my\r\n          life again. And I'd like to see what San\r\n          Francisco's all about.\r\n          Doug nods and looks to Bob. You can tell he wants to go.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          I'm in, too! Let's ride to San--\r\n          Suddenly, a mini-van pulls up. KAREN and KELLY hop out.\r\n\r\n                          BOB / DOUG\r\n          Karen? / Kelly?\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n\r\n                         (TO BOB)\r\n          I told you I was coming, Bob!\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n\r\n                         (TO DOUG)\r\n          Hey, honey.\r\n          Kelly kisses Doug. He smiles, glad to see her.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Hey, baby. What are you doing here?\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          Karen said you guys were in trouble. I\r\n          kept calling your cell, but somebody\r\n          programmed it to not receive calls from\r\n          our house.\r\n          Doug shoots Woody a look.\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n\r\n                         (CAUGHT)\r\n          Excuse me.\r\n          Woody hurries over to his bike.

Actually, we just decided we were\r\n          going to keep pressing West for a few--\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n          Oh, no. No way! I came all the way out\r\n          here, rented a car, drove to this podunk\r\n\r\n                         LITTLE TOWN--\r\n          As Karen is saying this, Bob looks over at the guys, then\r\n          back to Karen. He can't take it anymore.\r\n\r\n                         BOB\r\n          --Karen!\r\n          Karen stops talking, shocked by Bob raising his voice.\r\n\r\n                         BOB (CONT'D)\r\n          Listen to me. This is My vacation and if\r\n          I want to ride on with my friends, well\r\n          that's what I'm going to do! And if you\r\n          have a problem with that, well... Tough\r\n          shit!\r\n          There's a moment of silence as Karen absorbs this. The\r\n          guys all look at Bob proudly. After a few seconds,\r\n          Karen's face softens.\r\n\r\n                         KAREN\r\n\r\n                         (SUDDENLY MEEK)\r\n          Okay. Sorry...

I love you.\r\n          Bob smiles at her and gets on his bike.\r\n          ANGLE ON: DOUG and KELLY. Kelly looks at Doug.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          So are you going, too?\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          I hadn't really decided. I have been\r\n          having a good time, though.\r\n\r\n                         (MORE)\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 119.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n\r\n                         (SMILES)\r\n          I even got beaten up.\r\n          Doug winks cockily. Kelly lights up.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          There he is! I saw old Doug!\r\n          Doug blushes.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          You'll see him even more if you and Billy\r\n          meet me in San Francisco. We've got a\r\n          suite at the Ritz-Carlton.\r\n          Doug smiles and gets onto his motorcycle. Kelly looks\r\n          concerned.\r\n\r\n                         KELLY\r\n          What about work? And Billy's school?\r\n          Doug shrugs like he hasn't a care in the world.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Ahh. We can risk it.\r\n          Kelly smiles and kisses him proudly. Doug grabs her face\r\n          and kisses her back... Then, turns to Woody and Bob.\r\n\r\n                         DOUG (CONT'D)\r\n          We ready?\r\n\r\n                         WOODY\r\n          I think so. Dudley? What do you think?\r\n          The camera PULLS OUT to reveal DUDLEY, sitting on his\r\n          motorcycle. Next to him, is MAGGIE, sitting in the rusty\r\n          sidecar now attached to Dudley's bike. She's wearing\r\n          Dudley's goggles and nods to him encouragingly. Dudley\r\n          looks back over to Doug, Bob and Woody.\r\n\r\n                         DUDLEY\r\n          Let's ride.\r\n          They start their motorcycles. The engines roar to life.\r\n\r\n                         DISSOLVE TO:\r\n\r\n          EXT. HIGHWAY U.S. 50 - LATER THAT DAY\r\n\r\n          The four motorcycles (and one sidecar) cruise down the\r\n          open highway. The guys smile as the wind blows in their\r\n          faces.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n          \"Wild Hogs\" writers first draft 7/06/05 120.\r\n          It's freedom, joy and friendship all wrapped up in one\r\n          expression. The camera PANS AROUND THEM, and finally\r\n          ZOOMS IN ON DOUG. We see his eyes sparkle a little bit,\r\n          and he opens his mouth:\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n\r\n                         (SINGING)\r\n          I walk these streets, a loaded six string\r\n          on my back.\r\n          I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make\r\n          it back...\r\n          I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride!\r\n          I'm wanted...\r\n          The other guys smile and join in:\r\n\r\n          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY\r\n          Dead or alive!\r\n          They all look at each other as they continue to sing over\r\n          the roar of the engines:\r\n\r\n          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY (CONT'D)\r\n          Ohh, I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my\r\n          side!\r\n\r\n                         I'M WANTED--\r\n\r\n                         DOUG\r\n          Wante-ee--ed!\r\n\r\n          DOUG/BOB/WOODY/DUDLEY\r\n          Dead or aliiiivvvee!\r\n\r\n          MUSIC CUE: BON JOVI'S \"WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE.\"\r\n          The camera slowly PULLS OUT TO AN AERIAL SHOT, as the\r\n          guys joyfully ride along the sunlit highway.\r\n          It's a good day to be a Wild Hog.\r\n\r\n                         FADE OUT:\r\n\r\n                         END CREDITS\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nWild Hogs\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Brad Copeland\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Comedy\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:38:53.726961"}
