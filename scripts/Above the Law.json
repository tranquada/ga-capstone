It is as if\n     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove\n     it to the others, too.\n<b>\n</b>     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         5.\n\n<b>24   FIRST PRISONER\n</b>     dies in agony on the ground.\n\n<b>25   SECOND PRISONER\n</b>     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,\n     scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or\n     higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes\n     since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough\n     customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if\n     daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the\n     prisoner with barely contained hatred.

There is a moment\n      between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what\n      he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father\n      Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.\n<b>155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO\n</b>\n      continue down the hall.\n<b>                             JACKSON\n</b>               I didn't know this church was a\n               sanctuary, Father.\n<b>                            FATHER GENARRO\n</b>               Yes.

The answers are all zero;\n      Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out\n      the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls\n      in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-\n      rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward\n      his car --\n<b>                                 FIRST LATINO\n</b>                          (polite, casual)\n                   'Cuse me, sir.

Nico has a\n           moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking\n           out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-\n           ness.   Then:\n<b>\n</b><b>                                                           49.\n</b>\n      B)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man\n           starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his\n           wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,\n           keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun\n           Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,\n           slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing\n           the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his\n           wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain\n           link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man\n           (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-\n           ing, half-unconscious.\n      C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's\n           head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of\n           the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,\n           blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing\n           Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes\n           down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in\n           pain.\n      D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,\n           flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-\n           ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the\n           van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with\n           just his head and shoulders dangling free.\n\n      E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar\n           Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,\n           and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-\n           tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one\n           knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,\n           machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and\n           whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of\n           Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-\n           mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at\n           his own groin.\n      F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-\n           perately to regain his senses. He tries to get\n           Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-\n           way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,\n           bolts.\n\n      G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to\n           Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van\n           window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the\n           head, then tears off after Machete Man --\n\n<b>192   EXT.

A fire escape is ad-\n      jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by\n      the ankle.

Fox, dying, slings his .45 to Nico, who\n      snatches it from the ground just as a HAIL of MACHINE GUN\n      FIRE THUNDERS around him.

Zagon backs\n      off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico\n      back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose.

Zagon drops to the floor,\n      half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-\n      gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's\n      face, about to pull the trigger.

The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by\n      inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.\n      The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder\n      holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping\n      him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,\n      spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun\n      barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!\n      Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with\n      a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a\n      double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun\n      to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp\n      scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He\n      yanks the choke cable off his neck --\n\n<b>408   ZAGON - AGAINST WALL\n</b>      On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,\n      snatches up his famous knife.

We see Zagon's nose\n      and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's\n      elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in\n      a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against\n      the joint -- which now starts to rip in half.
