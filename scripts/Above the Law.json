Then:\n    in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he\n    grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his\n    name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:\n    Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,\n    being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese\n    martial artists, then himself as an instructor.

JUNGLE - DAY\n    Blowing through the roof of a dense jungle straight AT\n    CAMERA, HELICOPTER ROTORS RISE to a DEAFENING PITCH.\n    SUPER:  Viet - Cambodian Border, 1972. Jungle foliage\n    whips in the fierce downdraft as --\n3   \"HUEY\" GUNSHIP\n    with US Army markings becomes discernible. The chopper\n    lowers toward a crude landing zone hacked out of the\n    wilderness. We GLIMPSE Cambodian troops and several\n    machine gun positions around the LZ.\n4   EXT. JUNGLE - TWO ARMED AMERICANS - DAY\n    watch from the edge of the landing zone. We recognize Nico\n    and Fox, now in their twenties, dressed in the nonmilitary\n    jungle attire that usually marks a CIA \"spook.\"\n\n5   HELICOPTER\n    touches down. THREE OLDER AMERICANS -- rough-looking, in\n    their mid-thirties, all carrying some kind of medical bags\n    -- disembark into the HOWLING ROTOR BLAST. They hit the\n    ground nimbly, as if they've done it many times before.\n\n6   LEADER OF THREE\n\n    wears a khaki cowboy hat and packs a pearl-handled .45.\n7   NICO AND FOX\n\n    don't know whether to react with laughter or uneasiness.\n\n                                                             2.\n\n                                FOX\n                  You ever see chemical interrogation\n                  before?\n\n     Nico's eyes stay on the approaching \"cowboy,\" KURT ZAGON,\n     for whom he plainly feels an instant animosity.\n                                NICO\n                  These assholes are agency?\n\n8    NICO'S POV\n     FOLLOWS the medical bag in the cowboy's hand.\n\n9    BACK TO FOX AND NICO\n                                FOX\n                  We're all C.I.A.

JUNGLE - LATE AFTERNOON\n     Nico in the point,   leading Fox and the three CIT (Chemical\n     Interrogation Team)   men down an unmarked, twisting trail.\n     We see from Nico's   gait that he is athletic, a born leader\n     and totally at home   in the jungle.\n11   TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON\n     snakes along a ridge line, high enough to give us a view and\n     let us know these guys are way out in the boonies.\n                                ZAGON\n                  How long till we're across the border?\n                                NICO\n                  We've been over for the past hour.\n     The group continues along the ridge.\n\n                                                   CUT TO:\n12   EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT\n\n     The sky glows from nearby bomb attacks.\n13   NICO\n\n     listening hard -- and even sniffing the air -- glances back\n     at Zagon, who stands impatiently, drawing on a cigarette.\n                                ZAGON\n                  What are you looking at, hotshot?\n\n                                NICO\n                         (indicates cigarette\n                          glow)\n                  Why don't you light a bonfire?\n\n                                                         3.\n\n     Irritably, Zagon ditches his smoke.\n                             ZAGON\n               Just drive the taxi, ace.\n\n     As the party moves out, Fox flashes Nico a look as if to say,\n     \"Don't fuck with these guys.\"\n\n14   EXT. CAMBODIAN BASE CAMP - NIGHT\n\n     A pocket-fortified position. Armed Cambodian lookouts,\n     several hooches, radio equipment. Nico leads the party in\n     through the perimeter. Zagon eyes the layout like he's seen\n     100 of them. Fox indicates a hooch.\n                             FOX\n                      (to Zagon)\n               They're in there.\n\n     The three CIT men start for the hooch. Nico casts a concerned\n     glance around at the base camp troops, looking sloppy as hell.\n                             NICO\n               I don't trust these yo-yo's.\n15   FULL SHOT - BASE CAMP\n     We see Nico moving like a shadow from one defensive position\n     to another, checking the perimeter. We can vaguely hear him\n     ROUSTING the Cambodian lookouts, speaking in dialect.\n\n16   DEFENSIVE POSITION - NICO\n     hears a SOUND, looks back toward the hooch.\n17   NICO'S POV - HOOCH\n     Two Asian prisoners, stripped to the waist, babbling in-\n     coherently, are dragged out the back by a pair of Cambodian\n     guards and hustled off into the darkness. VOICES can be\n     heard inside the hooch. A single lantern glowing inside\n     gives the hut a creepy, frightening aspect.\n\n18   BACK TO NICO\n     He's extremely uneasy about what's about to happen inside the\n     hooch.\n\n19   INT. HOOCH - CLOSE ON RICKETY CARD TABLE - NIGHT\n     on which are spread a terrifying array of syringes, drug vials\n     and surgical instruments. Zagon's hand picks up a hypodermic,\n     squirt-tests it.\n\n                                                          4.\n\n20   TWO ASIAN PRISONERS\n     are on their knees, shirtless, handcuffed with heavy nylon\n     tape to a stake driven into the ground in the center of the\n     hooch. One of the subordinate CIT men moves in, grabs the\n     first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first\n     prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.\n     Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.\n\n                               ZAGON\n                 That's the nice thing about modern\n                 technology. You don't have to wait\n                 for results.\n\n     He moves close to the first prisoner.\n                               ZAGON\n                        (to first prisoner)\n                 Where is it, Charley? You got six tons\n                 of our shit --\n     The prisoner tries to speak, but he's in such torment all\n     that comes out is a blood-curdling wail --\n21   EXT. BAST CAMP - NICO\n\n     hears this horrifying cry.   He starts swiftly toward the\n     hooch --\n22   INT. HOOCH - INTERPRETER\n\n     has moved as close to Zagon and the first prisoner as a fight\n     referee to two boxers. The prisoner is convulsing wildly.\n     Zagon grabs him fiercely by the hair.\n                               ZAGON\n                 Don't you die on me, fucker --\n                               FOX\n                        (from the side)\n                 What the hell's wrong?\n                               ZAGON\n                        (throws the prisoner\n                         down)\n                 This pussy can't hold his liquor.\n\n     The first prisoner is plainly in a death spasm.\n\n23   NICO\n     enters at this point. He takes in the scene quickly, moves\n     to a spot beside the entrance. Zagon doesn't look at Nico,\n     but it's plain he is aware of Nico's presence. It is as if\n     he wants to prove something to this muscular kid -- and prove\n     it to the others, too.\n\n     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                         5.\n\n24   FIRST PRISONER\n     dies in agony on the ground.\n\n25   SECOND PRISONER\n     watches with eyes like flint. He is in his mid-forties,\n     scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or\n     higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes\n     since the French in the 50's. He is plainly one tough\n     customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if\n     daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the\n     prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't\n     back down an inch.\n                             ZAGON\n                      (to second prisoner)\n               So my little doctor bag doesn't                      *\n               scare you, eh? Well I don't need                     *\n               it to open your yap.                                 *\n     Zagon reaches to a scabbard on his Western belt, pulls out a\n     fearsome serrated blade -- a cross between a bowie knife and\n     a scalpel. He steps toward the prisoner, displaying the\n     blade in the lantern light.\n\n26   NICO\n     watches impassively.\n                             ZAGON (O.S.)\n                      (to prisoner)\n               Where's our load, you sack of slime?\n               What did you do with my shit? --\n27   ZAGON\n     punches  the prisoner full in the face, holding the knife\n     handle  in his fist to double the force of the blow and to\n     terrify  him with the proximity of the blade. The prisoner\n     crashes  sideways, face bloody --\n                             ZAGON\n               I'm gonna teach you good. I'm gonna\n               teach you never to fuck with my\n               opium --\n\n28   FOX AND TWO CIT MEN\n\n     seem to know exactly what this is about.\n29   NICO\n\n     didn't know, but the new kid on the block is catching on fast.\n     Nico has difficulty containing his emotion. Zagon stands\n     over the prisoner, as if daring him to get back up.\n\n                                                    6.\n\nThe prisoner gets back to his knees, bloody eyes meeting\nZagon's with defiance --\n\n                       ZAGON\n                (to prisoner)\n         You're a hard nigger, aren't you, boy?\n         You took it from the Chinks... you took\n         it from the French. You'll be fucked\n         if some Yankee peckerwood's gonna start\n         your gums flapping --\nNico watches Zagon move the knife blade closer to the\nprisoner.\n\n                       ZAGON\n         -- Well, you're gonna chirp for me,\n         tough guy. You're gonna sing like a\n         choir --\n\nNico takes a step toward Zagon.\n                       NICO\n         What the fuck does this have to do\n         with military intelligence?\n                       ZAGON\n         Your orders are 'assist and observe'\n         cherry --\nZagon turns to face Nico --\n\n                       FOX\n                (to Nico)\n         Back off, partner --\nZagon turns from Nico. He moves close to the second prisoner,\nclose as a lover, displaying the blade in the lamplight.\n                       ZAGON\n                (to second prisoner)\n         I'm gonna start carving at your ankles.\n         We'll throw your feet in that box right\n         over there. Then I'm gonna take off\n         your arms --\nOne of the CIT men yanks the prisoner's leg forward, clamping\nit to the ground with his hands. The prisoner still hasn't\nflinched. He seems as locked into this dance of death as\nZagon.\n                         NICO\n                  (can't take\n                   much more)\n         Fox --\n                       FOX\n         Shut up, Nico.\n\n                                                         7.\n\n                             ZAGON\n               You can disappear as easy as this\n               slope, kid --\n\n     Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.\n     Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with\n     terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.\n     Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a\n     ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally\n     comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops\n     in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men\n     move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing\n     his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico\n     out of the hooch --\n30   EXT. HOOCH - NIGHT\n\n     Fox wrestles Nico away from the hooch --\n\n                             FOX\n               Are you crazy?!!\n                      (as Nico jerks free)\n               What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!\n     Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps\n     away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his\n     .45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the\n     hooch --\n                            FOX\n               Nico!\n                             NICO\n               I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me\n               later.\n\n     The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.\n     Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --\n\n                             FOX\n               I'll cover this. Get back to the\n               L.Z. --\n                      (as Nico resists)\n               -- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the\n               fuck outa here!\n     The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,\n     pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to\n     seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,\n     apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The\n     troops, confused, hold up for a moment.\n\n                             FOX\n                      (to Nico)\n               I'll call for a chopper... get outa\n               here!\n\n     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        8.\n\n     Nico gives a last look, turns and takes off down the jungle\n     trail. Fox seems abandoned. The DISTANT BOMBING CONTINUES.\n     Nico disappears into the darkness.\n\n                                                FADE TO BLACK.\n     FADE IN ON:\n\n31   CHURCH STEEPLE - DAY\n\n     TILT DOWN to reveal St. Elizabeth's, a huge parish church in\n     an Italian/Latino neighborhood in Chicago. The church looks\n     festive, we see a few formally-dressed people hurrying in,\n     then a squad car pulls up. The cops run upstairs as if\n     they're late --\n32   INT. ST. MARY'S - DAY\n\n     A baptism in progress. Nico -- 15 years older than when we\n     last saw him, is standing beside SARA, his lovely wife        *\n     -- watching a 60-ish priest, FATHER GENARRO, finish the\n     final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest\n     straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth\n     around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and\n     relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in\n     uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro\n     with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's\n     garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from\n     all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm\n     around Sara.                                                  *\n\n33   EXT. NICO'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY\n     Huge trays of Italian delicacies are carried out into the\n     sunlight by several \"old country\"-type women. Wine is\n     poured from generous carafes. Friends and relatives are\n     everywhere, laughing and enjoying themselves; apparently\n     the party has come here straight from the church.

NICO'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY\n     Nico comes out of the bedroom, adjusting his shoulder\n     holster, tugging his jacket over it. He sees his mother\n     standing near the head of the stairs, just outside\n     another bedroom door. Concern on her face.\n                             NICO\n               What are you doing in here, Mama?\n               Go join the party...\n     Nico comes down the hall, tucking in his shirt -- stops\n     to give his mother a squeeze.

Hard faces check him out\n     subtly, ignore him. Nico approaches the bartender, shows a\n     photograph. The bartender (BAD DUDE) shakes his head.\n\n                            BAD DUDE                                 *\n              Why the fuck don't you assholes                        *\n              leave me alone?                                        *\n\n     He continues mouthing off to Nico.

From behind the bar, the bartender swings a          *\nsawed-off baseball bat into view. Other bodies move         *\nominously toward Nico. Suddenly he spins and, in a move     *\nalmost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right\nout of its floor socket. Beer bottles fly, bodies crash.\nNico slams the First Jacket in the face so hard it looks\nlike his nose has exploded. Blood sprays onto Nico's silk\nshirt. He hauls the Second Jacket upright, nails him with\na shot that crushes three ribs. A savage elbow blasts the\nthird, head over heels, out over the bar and careening\ninto the sink. In three seconds 600 pounds of fat has\nbeen put in cold storage. The rest of the bar is on its\nfeet. Four huge men confront Nico. Now five. Six.\nSeven. Nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat-\ntered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men --\n\n                         NICO\n          Come on.

Nardo turns -- CHI CHI TESTAMENTE, a wiry,\n     pock-faced Latino, stands in the shadows (it is clear he\n     has been waiting there, hiding) -- holding a small\n     silencer automatic.\n\n                            CHI CHI\n              You were right, cabron.                            *\n\n     ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/17/87                           24.\n\n     One SHOT between the eyes and Nardo CRASHES backward into\n     the WINE RACK, eyes wide with shock and bewilderment. Chi\n     Chi SHOOTS him AGAIN; Nardo drops like a stone. Coolly,\n     professionally, Chi Chi pumps FOUR more SHOTS into the\n     prone busboy's head. Chi Chi ejects the clip into his\n     palm, unscrews the silencer, holsters the gun. Salvano\n     appears at the top of the stairs. Two busboys are behind\n     him. One of them is the young pimp. The busboys hurry        *\n     down, the pimp -- scared shitless but playing it macho-cool. *\n     Salvano comes down the stairs.

ST. ELIZABETH'S PARISH CHURCH - DAY\n\n       Salvano's Caddy   pulls up outside the same church where we   *\n       saw Nico's son   get baptized. Salvano and Chi Chi get out,\n       look both ways   up and down the street. Salvano, holding     *\n       flowers, makes   eye contact with a car down the block.       *\n146    EXT. STREET UP BLOCK FROM CHURCH - DAY\n\n       Nico's car backs out of sight around the corner.\n147    SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF CHURCH\n       Salvano and Chi Chi, seeing nothing, enter the church.\n148    INT. CHURCH - DAY\n       A smattering of older women and men praying. Salvano and\n       Chi Chi stop at the head of the aisle, genuflect to the\n       altar, move in, take seats toward the front.\n149    BACK OF CHURCH\n\n       Nico and Jackson slip in the front door, glide silently\n       into the shadows at the rear of the church.\n\n                               JACKSON\n                 This is your mother's church,\n                 isn't it?\n\n                               NICO\n                 Yeah. But I bet she's never seen\n                 these boys in the choir.\n150    NICO'S POV\n\n       Salvano's head is bowed, but Chi Chi is looking around\n       quite carefully. Nico and Jackson fade into the shadows\n       behind the huge pillars.\n\n      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        37A.\n\n151   SALVANO AND CHI CHI\n      After a few moments, the pair rises. They cross them-\n      selves, start out for the front door. As they walk, they\n      continue to look for something.\n152   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                           *\n\n      Nico and Jackson emerge into a courtyard which reveals a\n      day care center and a rectory. They head toward the front\n      of the building. Jackson, planning on picking up their\n      tail on Salvano, is stoped by Nico. He wants to stay and\n      look around.\n\n                                                          38.\n\n                             FATHER GENARRO (O.S.)\n               Nicola! That can't be you in\n               church without the family!\n\n      Nico turns to see Father Genarro, perspiring in a baggy\n      sweatshirt, a handball glove on his hand. The courtyard\n      alongside the church is marked off as an athletic area.\n\n                             NICO\n               Father Genarro.\n      The priest seizes Nico's hand warmly, smiles at Jackson.\n\n                             FATHER GENARRO\n               This must be your partner in\n               crime.\n                      (shakes her hand)\n               I'm Father Genarro.

I have\n               to show you something. Please.\n      The priest begins leading Nico and Jackson. Jackson keeps\n      glancing back out the alley to see Salvano's car slowly\n      driving by.\n153   INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY\n\n      This is an old building. The dark corridors resemble an\n      underground bunker. Old trophies and furniture are stored\n      along the walls. The two cops and the priest walk.\n      Another priest emerges from a door, nods, passes. Nico\n      and Jackson glance in through the door as they walk.\n      They reach a door with a broken handle. It looks like a\n      break-in has taken place.\n\n                             FATHER GENARRO\n               The rats are getting bigger.\n                             NICO\n               When did this happen?\n\n                             FATHER GENARRO\n               Two nights ago.

The door opens. A twelve-year-old who looks like\n      he's from Central America stands in the doorway.\n\n                              FATHER GENARRO\n                       (in Spanish)\n                It's all right, son.

CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY\n\n      A largish room, no exposed windows, everything boarded up.\n      Newly-constructed makeshift toilet and shower in one corner,\n      various cots. A number of LATIN REFUGEES -- families mostly\n      -- react shyly as Father Genarro introduces Nico and Jackson.\n      Sister Bonifacia is there, and a youthful priest, FATHER\n      TOMASSINO. We will see both of them again.\n                              FATHER GENARRO\n                       (referring to the cops)\n                These are friends.\n                       (to Nico)\n                This is Father Tomassino.\n\n                             FATHER TOMASSINO\n               How do you do?\n      Nico shakes the young priest's hand. There is a moment\n      between them as Nico meets Tomassino's eyes, liking what\n      he sees. The refugees are relieved, however, when Father\n      Genarro, Nico and Jackson take their leave.\n155   NICO, JACKSON AND FATHER GENARRO\n\n      continue down the hall.\n                             JACKSON\n               I didn't know this church was a\n               sanctuary, Father.\n                            FATHER GENARRO\n               Yes.

Nico takes his mother's\n      arm, helps her to her feet.\n\n      ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                        45.\n\n      Sara wakes and picks up Julian. Mama knows Father Genarro     *\n      has died. She begins sobbing softly. Other members of\n      the congregation are in the hallway, mourning. Nico, with\n      his family, takes several steps toward the exit. Suddenly,\n      Nico stops. He sees Agent Neeley entering (the FBI man who    *\n      ordered him off the case) accompanied by Lieutenant Strozah   *\n      and two uniformed officers.\n\n                              NICO\n                Sara... go down to the car; I'll                    *\n                be with you in a minute.\n      He hails Neeley.                                              *\n\n                              NICO\n                I need to talk to you.\n                       (a glance to Strozah\n                        and others)\n                ...

Nico storms toward\n           the front door of the restaurant.\n      B)   INT. RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON                           *\n\n           Nico storms through toward the restaurant rear. The\n           employees are getting ready for the evening crowd. He\n           flashes his badge, checks the kitchen, Salvano's\n           office.   The man is gone.\n\n      C)   INT. MORGUE - LATE AFTERNOON\n           Jackson has her list from the hospital.    A coroner and\n           his assitant show her a body on a slab.    The body is\n           that of Alan Singletary, the man we saw   in the front     *\n           row of the church. Jackson takes notes.     The dead man   *\n           is definitely not the ethnic type you'd   expect in St.\n           Mary's congregation.\n      D)   EXT. BODY AND FENDER SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON\n           The same place where Nico and Jackson wire-tapped Chi\n           Chi. Nico interrogates the shop boss, several workers.\n           All shake their head, gesture emphatically. Salvano\n           not here.\n      E)   CUT BACK TO MORGUE - JACKSON\n\n           takes Polaroids of the dead man's I.D. and personal\n           effects.\n\n187   CLOSEUP OF DEAD MAN'S EFFECTS\n      as Jackson's flash pops. We see clearly a U.S. Senate\n      staff ID, a U.S. Senate office building parking pass and\n      an Illinois driver's license with address.\n188   EXT. AFFLUENT BROWNSTONE - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n      Nico comes storming out. A Maid and a bodyguard follow\n      after him screaming. The door slams.

ST. ELIZABETH'S CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON\n      Jackson at the blast scene. Police tapes rope the area\n      off while a TV news crew photographs the damage. Jackson       *\n      talks with neighborhood people, asking questions.\n190   EXT. BICEK'S BAR - LATE AFTERNOON\n\n      Nico in the alley, grilling several tough guys we saw be-\n      fore when he raided this bar. The answers are all zero;\n      Nico's disgusted, worn out, frustrated. He starts out\n      the alley -- At the edge of the street, a battered van pulls\n      in. A jacketed LATINO MAN leans against it, an unlit ciga-\n      rette in his mouth. As Nico approaches, turning toward\n      his car --\n                                 FIRST LATINO\n                          (polite, casual)\n                   'Cuse me, sir. Can I bum a light?\n      Nico slows, eyeing the   guy dubiously. As he reaches to\n      his jacket -- The side   door of the van flashes open. A\n      .38 is leveled straight   at Nico's head. Instantly three\n      other Latino hoods leap   to the sidewalk.\n                                 FIRST LATINO\n                          (machete under jacket)\n                   Don't even think about it,\n                   motherfucker.\n      Machete Man (First Latino) snatches Nico's gun from its\n      shoulder holster. Two hoods shove Nico back into the\n      alley. Nico checks out his assailants quickly. Four of\n      them. Machete, CROWBAR, BALL BAT, GUN.\n                                 MACHETE MAN (FIRST LATINO)\n                   You come to our streets... fuck\n                   with our people. Now our people\n                   gonna fuck with you.\n\n      The five advance on Nico.\n                                 PIPE MAN\n                   We ain't gonna shoot you, man.\n                   We gonna beat you to death. You\n                   gonna learn what it means to 'get\n                   down.'\n\n191   QUICK CUTS\n      A)   Nico is  trapped. The hoods advancing. Nico has a\n           moment  of stillness, as if all senses are clicking\n           out of  normal gear and into some hyper-combat readi-\n           ness.   Then:\n\n                                                           49.\n\n      B)   Gun and Machete Man are side by side. As Machete Man\n           starts to move, Nico spins in beside him, seizes his\n           wrist, twists it violently, wrenching the machete away,\n           keeping Machete Man between him and Gun Man so Gun\n           Man can't shoot. In a flash, Nico swings the machete,\n           slicing over the top of Machete Man, half-severing\n           the wrist of Gun Man. Gun Man falls, clutching his\n           wrist in agony; the gun skitters away beneath a chain\n           link fence, out of reach. Nico flips Machete Man\n           (who has Nico's gun in his pocket) sending him crash-\n           ing, half-unconscious.\n      C)   Instantly, Pipe Man aims a home run shot at Nico's\n           head. Nico uses the machete, matches the angle of\n           the oncoming blow, slides under and, in the same arc,\n           blocks the blow and turns it into a strike, slashing\n           Pipe Man's tendons behind the knee. Pipe Man goes\n           down on one knee, writhing, hamstrung, crying out in\n           pain.\n      D)   Now Ball Bat attacks. Nico intercepts the blow,\n           flips Bat Man ass over teakettle, sending him sail-\n           ing -- feet first -- through the side window of the\n           van. Bat Man CRASHES THROUGH the GLASS, hung up with\n           just his head and shoulders dangling free.\n\n      E)   Nico is spread out, feet wide, in a crouch. Crowbar\n           Man sees his chance. He is the fiercest of the four,\n           and the savviest fighter. He throws three consecu-\n           tive vicious blows at Nico's head; Nico drops to one\n           knee, dodges the blows, then intercepts the third,\n           machete in hand, matches the arc of interception and\n           whips the blade up -- straight into the crotch of\n           Crowbar Man. Crowbar Man can't believe it. He re-\n           mains frozen a moment, staring at Nico, then down at\n           his own groin.\n      F)   Machete Man, the first to be flipped, struggles des-\n           perately to regain his senses. He tries to get\n           Nico's gun from his own pocket, but Nico bats it a-\n           way. Machete Man scrambles to his feet, in terror,\n           bolts.\n\n      G)   Nico snatches his gun from the sidewalk, glances to\n           Bat Man who is still half-dangling from the van\n           window. Nico gives Bat Man one parting punch to the\n           head, then tears off after Machete Man --\n\n192   EXT. STREET - DAY\n      Shrieks from passersby as Machete Man hurtles past,\n      straight into the street. A car nearly hits him, he\n      vaults its hood. Here comes Nico, in hot pursuit. He\n      too leaps the car, whose owner is staring, cursing --\n193   ANGLE DOWN BLOCK\n\n      An all-out foot face.\n\n                                                             50.\n\n      Machete Man is a speedster; he hurdles a row of trash cans.\n      TWO YOUNG GIRLS, on a stoop, whistle as he passes.\n\n                             FIRST GIRL\n                Fly, baby!\n194   NICO\n\n      tears after this human cannonball.   Amazingly, he's\n      gaining --\n195   INT. BODEGA - DAY\n\n      Machete Man highballs off the sidewalk, straight into a\n      Mom and Pop groceria. Customers scatter in shock as the\n      hood blasts past them, out the back door. Here comes\n      Nico. Patrons curse in Spanish as he barrels past --\n\n196   EXT. YARD BEHIND BODEGA - DAY\n      Machete Man bolts from the bodega into a small patio with\n      tables and chairs. He leaps the fence into the next yard,\n      which belongs to a funeral home. He hurdles the headstone\n      inventory, clambers up the fence on the far side --\n197   BACK TO NICCO\n      pursuing along the same route.\n198   MACHETE MAN\n\n      claws his way to the top of the fence and onto a frame-\n      work of two-by-fours which form an arbor-like canopy a-\n      bove the third back yard. Plastic sheeting is tacked\n      between the beams. Machete Man glances back at Nico,\n      starts out -- tightrope-style -- across the two-by-fours.\n      Nico reaches the fence behind the hood, starts also onto\n      the two-by-fours. We hear FEMALE SCREAMS from below as\n      the rickety structure starts to wobble precariously.\n      Machete Man reaches the far side. A fire escape is ad-\n      jacent; he grabs for it, starts up. Nico catches him by\n      the ankle. The two crash together back onto the two-by-\n      fours, which give way, sending them plunging into --\n\n199   BACKYARD OF FLOWER SHOP - DAY\n      Four young Oriental women, potting plants, react with\n      terror as the two bodies CRASH through. Machete Man\n      scrambles away from Nico but is trapped in the corner\n      next to the rear shop door. The flower girls can't move\n      either; Nico and the hood are too near the door. The\n      girls retreat to the far corner, squealing in fright.\n\n                              MACHETE MAN\n                       (to Nico, in terror)\n                No, hermano.

No one!\nNico slams him with a fierce shot to the ribs. The hood\ndoubles over, gasping. The flower girls shriek even\nlouder. Nico turns to the girls with a ferocious glare.\n                           NICO\n                    (shouting)\n             Shut up!\nThe girls instantly go silent in terror. Nico turns back\nto Machete Man, spins him violently face-down, jacking\nthe punk's right arm straight out behind him. We see\nthat Nico can break his elbow with one blow.\n                          NICO\n                   Give it to me!\nNico raises his fist to strike.\n\n                           MACHETE MAN\n             Jimmy Constanza!\nNico shoves the hood into the ground, tearing the hood's\nwallet from his trouser pocket. Nico rips the wallet a-\npart, seizes the kid's identification and holds it up. He\ngrabs the punk by the hair with his free hand. Machete\nMan is staring up in terror, wondering what this means.\n\n                           NICO\n             If you're lying to me, I'll come\n             and kill you right in your own\n             fucking kitchen.\n\nNico dumps him on the ground and walks away.

We see clearly the 15 years of   *\n      aging since SE Asia. His face is even scarier than when he\n      performed similar atrocities in those days. Zagon prepares\n      a syringe, tests it, shooting a clear liquid skyward.\n                              ZAGON\n                You'll be in heaven in a few minutes,\n                padre.

Jackson\n       accepts this reluctantly.\n\n                                                             81.\n\n297   EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT\n      Nico and Lukich exit the vehicle. Nico indicates an adjacent\n      building; he and Lukich start for it.\n\n298   INT. APARTMENT\n      Father Tomassino is beginning to come under the influence of\n      Zagon's chemicals. In spite of this the priest's spirit to\n      resist is astounding...\n                              ZAGON\n                Speak to me, Father -- who did you tell?\n\n                              FATHER TOMASSINO\n                I know what you are.

Antennas, skylights, clotheslines. The pair\n      creep soundlessly onto the next roof. They cross toward the\n      roof door like infantrymen, moving one at a time from cover\n      to cover, covering each other. They reach the door that\n      leads down into the building. Nico checks the far side of\n      the enclosure, nods to Lukich. Lukich cracks the roof door\n      open --\n300   STAIRWELL FROM ROOF - NICO AND LUKICH\n\n      Nico and Lukich creep down the stairs from the roof.    Nico\n      opens the door leading to the top (third) floor.\n301   INT. APARTMENT\n\n      The drugs have taken hold. The priest's brain is an open\n      memory bank for Zagon to probe.\n\n                              ZAGON\n                I want to know who you told.\n                              FATHER TOMASSINO\n                       (barely coherent)\n                I told them... you make the ninos...\n                see... castrating their fathers --\n                raping... mutilating their mothers\n                ...

Nico crosses\n      silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of\n      the hallway. Nico comes back toward the apartment door.\n      Lukich approaches from the opposite side. They take up\n      positions flanking the door, guns drawn. The LOUD MUSIC\n      CONTINUES from inside.\n304   INSIDE APARTMENT\n\n      Salvano and Chi Chi look on, revulsed.

Lukich SHOOTS him.\n      Nico NAILS the second goon, just as Chi Chi aims his sawed-\n      off pistol-grip shotgun at Nico. Nico has a split second to\n      dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. Chi Chi's DOUBLE-\n      BARREL BLAST blows the chair into powder. Almost instan-\n      taneously Nico sees the priest -- just as Zagon slashes the\n      priest's throat! Salvano SHOOTS Lukich point blank, in the\n      shoulder, sending Lukich's gun sailing. Nico, FIRING, grabs\n      Lukich, dives out the door with him --\n307   HALLWAY\n\n      Zagon and Salvano OPEN FIRE from the apartment full-tilt.\n      BULLETS RIP through the WALL, BLASTING WOOD and PLASTER\n      everywhere.

Finish him!\n\n      Nico is slamming a fresh clip in, Lukich is stumbling away\n      toward the stairwell. Salvano and Chi Chi appear in the\n      apartment doorway. Chi Chi levels his fierce \"hogleg\" at\n      Nico's head. At that instant -- A broadside of BULLETS slam\n      into the wall around Chi Chi. It's Jackson -- on the stairs!\n      Chi Chi is hit, but spins, FIRES. His shotgun blast catches\n      Jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll,\n      down the stairwell, out of sight. Nico reacts with agony,     *\n      twists on the floor, SHOOTS Chi Chi in the face. Nico pulls\n      the trigger as fast as he can, sending a HAIL of FIRE through\n      the doorway, through the walls. Salvano clutches his hench-\n      man, using his dead body as a shield; Nico's BULLETS blow Chi\n      Chi apart. Zagon FIRES back, hits Nico in the side by the\n      ribs!

Zagon backs\n      off, chest heaving. Pistol agent and Bad Dude plop Nico\n      back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. Nico\n      looks like the Viet prisoner -- the one we saw in the\n      opening sequence. Like the prisoner, Nico takes his\n      beating -- still conscious, still meeting Zagon's eyes\n      with defiance.\n\n                             ZAGON\n               This is where you came in, Toscani.\n               Only, now it's where you're gonna\n               check out.\n      He takes off his glove, grabs the syringe.

Noose agent slackens\n      his grip on the choke cable. Zagon moves in closer,\n      gloating, cooing --\n\n                                                          107.\n\n                              ZAGON\n                A fool learns from his own\n                mistakes.

Suddenly: Nico springs\n      to life (catching Noose man by surprise and jerking the\n      cable from his grip) -- grabbing Zagon with his taped\n      hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him\n      ferociously into the wall! Zagon drops to the floor,\n      half-conscious. Nico spins instantly to find: the Shot-\n      gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to Nico's\n      face, about to pull the trigger. Nico sidesteps, grabbing\n      the man's wrist. The SHOTGUN GOES OFF, missing Nico by\n      inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall.\n      The Noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder\n      holster. Nico snaps the Shotgun agent's wrist, flipping\n      him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon,\n      spinning behind the Noose agent, then using the shotgun\n      barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in!\n      Another swing wipes out Pistol agent. Bad Dude, now with\n      a clear shot, aims his M-16. Nico blows him away with a\n      double-barreled SHOTGUN BLAST. In a flash, Nico has spun\n      to Zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor-sharp\n      scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. He\n      yanks the choke cable off his neck --\n\n408   ZAGON - AGAINST WALL\n      On his feet again. He reaches swiftly to the floor,\n      snatches up his famous knife. Nico confronts him -- face\n      battered, bloody -- shaking, battling internal spasms.\n                              ZAGON\n                Can you feel the chemicals,\n                cherry?

We see Zagon's nose\n      and face completely cave in. Nico comes under Zagon's\n      elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in\n      a vise-like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against\n      the joint -- which now starts to rip in half. Zagon is\n      screaming and cursing, writhing in agony -- The drugs\n      have hit Nico full force now. He's weakening, his eyes\n      are starting to roll. Zagon tries one last surge of\n      strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle\n      free when: the elbow JOINT SNAPS in half with a sicken-\n      ing sound.\n\n       ABOVE THE LAW - Rev. 4/29/87                             108.\n\n       As the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, Nico reaches up\n       around Zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with\n       one arm. He begins to now do to Zagon's neck what he did\n       to his arm. We hear a terminal CRACK. Zagon's body\n       crumples to the floor.
