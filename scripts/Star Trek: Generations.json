Then we hear the woman's voice again, and we \n                   move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties \n                   standing next to Picard.\n\n                                           WOMAN\n                             Go on... say something.

Picard sits down and the \n                   children starts handing out presents with much laughter \n                   and chatting.\n\n                                           CHILDREN\n                             This one's for you... where's \n                             mine?...

It's a wondrous experience. \n                   He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across \n                   his face. For reasons he cannot name and does not even \n                   want to understand at the moment, he is very, very \n                   happy.\n                    \n                                           GIRL\n                                     (to Picard)\n                             Isn't the tree beautiful, Papa?\n\n                   Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in \n                   the world.\n\n                                           PICARD\n                             Oh yes... yes, it's astonishingly \n                             beautiful.

It's a beautiful piece with polished and \n                   gleaming brass.\n\n                                           YOUNG BOY\n                                     (excited)\n                             It's a sack-tent!\n\n                   Picard eyes it with delight.\n\n                                           PICARD\n                             You mean a sextant.

There is a swirl of activity and commotion \n                   as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played \n                   out.\n\n                                           WOMAN\n                                     (to Picard)\n                             I'll go get dinner ready.\n                             they'll be starving in a minute.\n\n                   Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room. He looks \n                   around the scene, utterly happy, utterly content.\n\n                   The children continue to chatter and laugh among \n                   themselves as Picard's eye falls on the glorious \n                   Christmas tree. He can't help but smile as he looks \n                   over the ornaments and decorations...\n\n             156   PICARD'S POV                                               156\n\n                   of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of \n                   color and light.\n\n             157   PICARD                                                     157\n\n                   His eye is caught by something in particular on the \n                   tree. He leans forward slightly and stares at it.\n\n             158   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       158\n\n                   His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the \n                   top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass \n                   ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a \n                   star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT...\n                   and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands \n                   outward into the glass sphere.\n\n                   It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is \n                   reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the \n                   movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way \n                   the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many \n                   ornaments on the tree.\n\n             159   PICARD                                                     159\n\n                   reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve \n                   within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something \n                   he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an \n                   otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the \n                   reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it \n                   aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands \n                   and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby \n                   window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow \n                   soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.\n\n             160   PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)                                       160\n \n                   reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the \n                   ornament -- it's still blinking.

A hawk is circling overhead, \n                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is\n                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath.

Picard moves to \n                   look around the corner and sees -\n\n                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks \n                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  \n                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is \n                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying \n                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual\n                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's \n                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard \n                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24\n                   Century Starfleet officer.\n\n                                           PICARD\n                             James Kirk.\n\n                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. \n                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in    \n                   Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the \n                   sensual feeling of the Nexus.

But as he rides, we begin to see a change come \n                   over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. \n                   Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot...\n                   and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a \n                   moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the \n                   ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something \n                   about that jump is nagging at him...\n\n                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. \n                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  \n                   ravine. \n\n                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the \n                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.\n\n                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   \n                   immediate stop. We can see on his face that something \n                   is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with \n                   a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.\n\n                   In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a \n                   horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a \n                   long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by \n                   side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his\n                   feelings...\n\n                                           KIRK\n                                     (re: ravine)\n                             I must have made this jump fifty \n                             times. and every time it scared \n                             the hell out of me.

Kirk turns and looks toward a particular \n                   hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the \n                   bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see \n                   the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.\n                                 \n                                           PICARD\n                                     (re: woman)\n                             Antonia?\n\n                                           KIRK\n                                     (nods)\n                             She's not real either, is she? \n                             Nothing here is... nothing here \n                             matters...\n\n                   All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of \n                   self-revelation.
