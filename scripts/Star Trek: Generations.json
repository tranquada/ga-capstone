A hawk is circling overhead, \n                   making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is\n                   cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath.

Picard moves to \n                   look around the corner and sees -\n\n                   James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks \n                   exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the  \n                   Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is \n                   vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying \n                   himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual\n                   labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's \n                   no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard \n                   recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24\n                   Century Starfleet officer.\n\n<b>                                           PICARD\n</b>                             James Kirk.\n\n                   Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. \n                   His expression is wondrous, almost child-like.

There is a large \n                   RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He \n                   spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse \n                   is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the \n                   precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.\n<b> \n</b>                   Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse \n                   on.

He slows the horse to a trot...\n                   and then to a complete stop.

Something \n                   about that jump is nagging at him...\n\n                   He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. \n                   The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the  \n                   ravine. \n\n                   Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the \n                   horse makes the LEAP across yet again.\n\n                   This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an   \n                   immediate stop.
