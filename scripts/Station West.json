OPEN COUNTRY - DAY\n</b>\n<b>               FADE IN\n</b>\n               The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus \n               clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the \n               sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. \n               The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the \n               slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, \n               revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside \n               the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It \n               is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it \n               as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In \n               the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:\n\n                       From: Argus Mine - Rock Pass\n                       To: U.S. Assay Office\n                       San Francisco\n\n               The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes \n               that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the \n               wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching \n               grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd \n               or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail \n               the ground.\n\n               Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon \n               when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These \n               are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty.\n\n               CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. \n               The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the \n               persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA \n               MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead \n               figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. \n               Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating \n               it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to \n               hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still \n               figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:\n\n<b>                                                                   FADE OUT\n</b>\n<b>               FADE IN\n</b>\n<b>               ROCK PASS - NIGHT\n</b>\n               This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has \n               mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors \n               and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the \n               scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, \n               its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing \n               the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:\n\n<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE\n</b>\n<b>               INT. HOTEL - NIGHT\n</b>\n               On the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a \n               guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he \n               sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks \n               in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk \n               completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last \n               leaves the bag and saunters out.\n\n<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE\n</b>\n<b>               EXT. SALOON - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well-\n               lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. \n               Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.\n\n<b>               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING\n</b>\n               It is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. A \n               long mahogany bar runs the length of it. To one side there \n               is a big stove and the gambling tables. Beyond can be seen \n               pool tables in an alcove. To another side, a man grinds away \n               at a piano. A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an \n               upper floor. The place is crowded and noisy with people. \n               Haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he \n               is looking the crowd over carefully -- missing no detail of \n               the place or the people in it. When his turn comes, he picks \n               up the dice, bets all over the place -- on the line, on the \n               odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. His \n               point is eight.\n\n<b>                                     STICKMAN\n</b>                         Eight the hard way! Pay the line!\n\n               Haven bets again, doubling all over the table.\n\n<b>                                     STICKMAN\n</b>                         Seven a winner.\n\n               Players glance at the newcomer. Prince appears from nowhere, \n               standing behind the stickman, watching. Prince is slender, \n               black-haired, handsome and impassive. Haven throws again. \n               Stellman, an Army officer, watches curiously. There is a \n               little rising murmur as Haven tosses another natural. He \n               does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. The bettors \n               get down on him. Prince touches the stickman's arm; the man \n               stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick. Prince \n               tosses the dice back to Haven. Haven's eyes are fixed on \n               him. With a little smile, Haven throws the dice to the next \n               man, picks up his winnings.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         No, thanks...\n\n               His eyes meet Prince's again and then he turns away, Prince's \n               gaze following him curiously, Stellman looks at Prince.\n\n<b>                                     STELLMAN\n</b>                         Know him?\n\n<b>                                     PRINCE\n</b>                         No. Why?\n\n<b>                                     STELLMAN\n</b>                         He just seems kind of free with that \n                         money.\n\n               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads \n               towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. \n               Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven, going his \n               way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing \n               back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him.\n\n               AT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight. All the \n               others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy \n               watching. But Haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a \n               woman now at the piano, singing. Softly, as if to herself \n               and for her own enjoyment. He is near the end of the bar and \n               near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this \n               moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, \n               self-consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as \n               Haven watches her. Behind them the fight is being stopped \n               and Charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, Mick Marion, as \n               he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. All \n               is as usual. The bartender is back at work. As Haven turns, \n               he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the \n               young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman). Haven glances at the \n               uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the \n               barman comes up.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                              (to barman)\n                         Whiskey -- like you'd pour it for \n                         yourself.\n\n               A girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty.\n\n<b>                                     BLONDE\n</b>                         Don't you know it's no fun to drink \n                         alone?\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         Not till after the first one.\n\n               He turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters \n               off. The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for Stellman, \n               the young officer. The barman folds his arms. Stellman looks \n               at Haven.\n\n<b>                                     STELLMAN\n</b>                         You a stranger here?\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                              (to barman, after \n                              gulping it in one \n                              gulp)\n                         What kind of whiskey was that?\n\n<b>                                     BARMAN\n</b>                         On the bottle it says Rye -- but the \n                         way you take it, I don't see what \n                         difference it makes.\n\n               Haven smiles at him.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         Another Rye.\n\n               The barman turns to get it.

As he comes near the table, the \n               blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.\n\n<b>                                     BLONDE\n</b>                         How is it now?\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         What?\n\n<b>                                     BLONDE\n</b>                         Drinking alone?\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                              (flipping her a coin)\n                         It's all right -- try it.\n\n               Haven is looking at Charlie. She is checking a stack of coins \n               the blonde has turned in to her. She glances up with a \n               fleeting smile at Haven.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         It's not a good habit if it makes \n                         you pick fights.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         Only with Second Lieutenants.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         We like Second Lieutenants here.\n\n               Their gazes meet and Prince notes it with narrowing eyes. \n               The gaze holds like a spell, and then Charlie's smile comes \n               back, from nowhere.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         You see -- here everybody fights, \n                         except the Army.\n\n               Haven looks at her, fascinated. She can feel a fascination \n               herself. Now Haven smiles a little.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         I wouldn't know --\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                              (still smiling)\n                         So anyone who doesn't like the Army --\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         I know what you mean, but I'm afraid \n                         I'll have to come back. I like the \n                         way you sing.\n\n               She looks at him in a second's silence. Haven turns and \n               leaves. She watches him go. Prince studies her face, his own \n               grim. A croupier comes up and places a paper before her. She \n               hardly notices it.\n\n<b>                                     CROUPIER\n</b>                         Okay, Charlie?\n\n               Charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         That's his limit.\n\n<b>                                     CROUPIER\n</b>                         There's a sucker getting hot with \n                         the dice at Ed's table.\n\n               He turns away. Prince sits still, his eyes on Charlie, his \n               slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking \n               dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by \n               holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and \n               forefinger, NOT by the edges, but by the sides. Now he does \n               it as he watches Charlie's face. Her eyes glance again at \n               the disappearing back of Haven. The sense of fascination \n               seems to have gotten her, too. Then she realizes the presence \n               of Prince and his shrewd gaze. She looks at him coolly.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         Well -- cool him off.\n\n               Prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...\n\n<b>               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT\n</b>\n               The board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now \n               the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, \n               the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon. \n               He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is \n               walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance \n               backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up \n               the street after Stellman.\n\n               ANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits. \n               When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence.\n\n<b>               EXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then \n               he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing \n               at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the \n               door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly \n               and Haven follows.\n\n<b>               INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As Stellman and Haven follow Mrs. Caslon to a rear door. \n               Looking around, Haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a \n               corner the big safe. (This room is described in a subsequent \n               scene.) So as to emit the least light, Mrs. Caslon lets \n               Stellman and Haven go through, then quickly follows them and \n               quickly shuts the door.\n\n<b>               INT. MRS. CASLON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n</b>\n               It is remarkably neat and elegant inside. As Haven, glancing \n               around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly \n               uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the \n               side of his collar. The captain is big and broad and scowling. \n               He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into \n               Haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. Stellman steps \n               forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each other.\n\n<b>                                     STELLMAN\n</b>                         Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer \n                         of the Post.\n\n               Haven gives a casual nod.\n\n<b>                                     STELLMAN\n</b>                         Mr. Haven -- sir.\n\n               Iles looks him up and down.

He sees Mick cross to \n               Prince and say something, then Prince gazes in his direction. \n               Haven's eyes meet those of Prince suddenly turned to him, \n               cold as glass. Charlie, seeing that Haven is watching and \n               listening to her impromptu singing, stops and makes her way \n               through the crowd towards a booth off the dance floor.

Mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does \n               so, Haven releases his grip. The bottle shoots up. The wine \n               spills over Mick's face and clothes. Infuriated, Mick flings \n               the bottle at Haven, but Haven ducks as he comes out of the \n               chair. The bottle crashes against the wall, and Haven's fist \n               crashes against Mick. The big man grunts and staggers back, \n               but he doesn't drop. As Haven sets himself, he is suddenly \n               pinned from behind by two bouncers.

At the crap table the dice read \n               seven but no one looks at them, all turning toward the scene. \n               A minor rises and the girl on his lap hits the floor. A drunk \n               steals a drink and no one sees him. (Business with glass) \n               Prince looks on coldly.

They reach the door. The crowd opens \n               for them a little.\n\n<b>               EXT.

As soon as the crowd has formed \n               an open space, Haven wheels and smacks Mick across the face \n               hitting with the heel of the hand, so that Mick rocks back \n               almost going down. There is dead silence. Mick sets himself \n               for the Kill, as he peels his coat.\n\n               Bristow is shaking with excitement.\n\n<b>                                     BRISTOW\n</b>                         Mick will kill him.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         That's ten to one.\n\n<b>                                     BRISTOW\n</b>                              (grinning)\n                         I don't like the other fellow's \n                         chances, but I'm a sucker for odds.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         You should always bet on a champion. \n                         Then you can only lose once.\n\n<b>                                     BRISTOW\n</b>                         You give ten to one...?\n                              (she nods)\n                         I'll take it.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         You're down.

He suddenly swings a haymaker which Haven easily ducks, \n               another and another that Haven evades.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         Don't miss so much. You'll got tired.\n\n               Mick misses again, fiercely and Haven cracks him one in the \n               midriff. Then steps out fast and waits.\n\n               Mick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth. It \n               stops Mick, and then Haven socks him again, this time with \n               the butt of his hand -- open palm -- on the nose. Mick is \n               surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips.\n\n               ANGLE on Charlie, Mark and Prince, as they watch. Charlie's \n               eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on Haven. Prince \n               watches without interest. Mark is tense and excited.\n\n<b>                                     BRISTOW\n</b>                         He can fight a little.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         A little won't be enough.\n\n               But you feel she wishes it might...\n\n               ANGLE on the fight.\n\n<b>                                     MICK\n</b>                         Stand still and fight.\n\n               As Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side, \n               clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time \n               Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a \n               push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives \n               Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing \n               victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in \n               time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees \n               shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before \n               he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own \n               chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling \n               across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash \n               the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls \n               clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick \n               gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he \n               closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly \n               shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the \n               blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he \n               almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms \n               close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of \n               Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing \n               squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, \n               but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute \n               power of the other man.\n\n               The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength \n               bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, \n               and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. \n               Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off \n               the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling \n               him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength \n               left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's \n               stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear.\n\n               Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised \n               that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end \n               quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries \n               to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws \n               pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally \n               lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack \n               to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he \n               lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven \n               it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, \n               the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men \n               groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless \n               to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock \n               him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls \n               his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, \n               glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, \n               dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has \n               staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now \n               he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he \n               passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him. \n               There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from \n               side to side like a wounded animal.\n\n               The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet, \n               drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, but \n               hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himself \n               with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow motion \n               pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his \n               remaining strength. Mick goes down.\n\n<b>                                     MICK\n</b>                              (getting up very slow)\n                         You can't do this.\n\n               Before he is up he goes down again, unable to make it.\n\n<b>                                     MICK\n</b>                              (in the dirt)\n                         Nobody can do this... to me.\n\n               The crowd is transfixed. They can't even cheer. The two \n               bouncers lean over the fallen Mick.\n\n<b>                                     BOUNCER\n</b>                         Somebody just did.\n\n               They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches. Then as Haven \n               turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. He \n               pushes aside people who try to assist him. They move aside \n               and watch him leave. The crowd goes back in the saloon behind \n               the vanquished Mick...\n\n               ANGLE on Charlie, Bristow and Prince. Prince watches the \n               beaten Mick go by with a smile of contempt. Charlie's eyes \n               are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of Haven. Mark's \n               eyes are dancing.\n\n<b>                                     BRISTOW\n</b>                         I can't believe it.

Charlie remains, \n               looking down the now empty street where Haven vanished, a \n               strange soft look in her eyes, a slow smile mounting her \n               lips.\n\n<b>               INT.

He stands there looking vaguely out the \n               window, sucking his knuckles absently as he listens to the \n               piano playing. Then he goes wearily to the bed and falls on \n               it gratefully, shutting his eyes, the towels still across \n               his shoulder. There is a moment of silence and then a soft \n               KNOCK at the door. Another KNOCK, and painfully Haven lifts \n               himself on one elbow and drags out his gun. The door opens \n               and Charlie enters. She shuts it behind her and stands looking \n               at him. He lets the gun fall and turns over on his back. \n               Charlie walks across to the bed and stands looking down at \n               him.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         How do you feel?\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         Like a million dollars.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         You just cost me a thousand.

As \n               Haven pulls the hand out, he sees that Goddard's fingers \n               have closed around his wallet. Puzzled, Haven opens the \n               wallet. There is a stiff-backed daguerreotype of his wife, \n               an expired Union Pacific Railroad pass, an express receipt, \n               a souvenir bank-note of the Confederacy, and a small, closely-\n               folded piece of paper. Unfolding this, Haven sees the top \n               line:\n\n               \"To Whom It May Concern\"\n\n<b>               HE READS FURTHER:\n</b>\n               \"This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating \n               as a legally deputized detective for Wells Fargo Stage and \n               Express Company.\"\n\n               Haven replaces the papers and lifts Goddard's body, carries \n               it to the stage and places it on the floor. He removes \n               Goddard's gun and shell belt and straps it on, closing the \n               stage door. Haven's face is grim as he studies the ground \n               nearby. The sticky mud shows clearly the new tracks of the \n               bandits' horses.

CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on \n               horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently \n               made camp for the night.

They take off across the meadow at a gallop. \n               Haven lets them get a good start before he mounts his own \n               horse, and follows after them.\n\n<b>                                                                   DISSOLVE\n</b>\n<b>               EXT.

Just as he reaches the office door, \n               just as his hand touches the knob, a shot rings out and he \n               crumples. He still tries, then his hand slips from the knob \n               and he lies there dead. The vacant street is empty with his \n               death. Haven stares. He takes a match from the counter, \n               applies it to his pipe -- then finding the pipe empty, smiles \n               thinly and pockets it\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                              (softly; turning to \n                              the clerk)\n                         You didn't throw away that verse?\n\n<b>                                     ORVILLE\n</b>                         No.\n\n<b>                                     HAVEN\n</b>                         You won't have to change it much.\n\n               He takes the little pistol from his pocket and glances at \n               it.

Haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to \n               the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. A second later \n               he is away. Shots RING OUT as Mick and Prince and the gunman \n               shoot. Haven rides on, bent low, out of town.

Around the mill office there \n               seems to be signs of unusual activity. Haven sees Mick Marion \n               going by on the road towards the mill. Mick passes not far \n               away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and \n               Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men -- too \n               many -- are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and \n               makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse.\n\n<b>               EXT. WOODS IN BACK OF WAREHOUSE\n</b>\n               As Haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then \n               approaches the building. He finds a window in back, breaks \n               it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has \n               attracted any attention, gun in hand now. It doesn't. Haven \n               replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls \n               inside.\n\n<b>               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               Haven surveys the piles of crates, boxes and equipment. He \n               starts his search methodically and swiftly. Suddenly a shaft \n               of light comes from the front doors opened now by two men. \n               Haven shrinks back, drawing his gun. The men start to enter \n               when Pete's voice is heard.\n\n<b>                                     PETE'S VOICE\n</b>                         Where you guys goin'?\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         You want them uniforms out, don't \n                         you?\n\n<b>                                     PETE'S VOICE\n</b>                         I'll tell you when.\n\n               The men turn and leave. Haven relaxes. He goes back to work, \n               pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had \n               approached, and there before him is revealed the army \n               uniforms, stacked in neat piles. He looks and smiles grimly. \n               Outside is the SOUND of horses and more men arriving. Haven \n               goes slowly around the warehouse now, looking for something. \n               At last he finds it: a can of kerosene. He takes it over to \n               the uniforms, pours it liberally on them. At just this moment \n               a figure appears at the door.\n\n<b>                                     MAN\n</b>                         What you think you're doin'?\n\n               Haven lights a match and tosses it on the soaked bales of \n               uniforms. They blaze up instantly. The man shoots as Haven \n               ducks away.\n\n<b>               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\n</b>\n               As the shot RINGS out. Pete and Mick, surrounded by many \n               men, turn swiftly. Flame and smoke emerge from the warehouse. \n               They start swiftly across, drawing guns. The man at the door \n               shoots again into the smoking interior. An answering SHOT \n               from Haven fells him.\n\n<b>               INT.

He can hear \n               shouting and, as he moves away, the useless attempt of men \n               to put out the blaze, working with buckets of water.\n\n<b>               EXT.

The flames now light the ground \n               around, and Pete appears around the side of the building. \n               Pete fires and Haven draws and shoots. Pete whirls away, hit \n               but still on his feet, driving forward, trying to shoot again \n               and this time Haven drills him clean and Pete goes down to \n               stay. Other men come up as Haven makes for the woods, \n               disappears.\n\n               Mick Marion and a dozen men appear, shooting. Mick suddenly \n               changes his mind, turns past the body of Pete, gets his horse \n               and heads back to town full tilt.\n\n<b>               INT.

Haven smiles, turns to the horse and moves slowly \n               through the trees to a place where he can mount; then mounts \n               and rides for it, SHOTS following him as he breaks into the \n               clear some hundred yards away and heads for the road that \n               Mick Marion took back to town.

As they mount to a brisk command, and \n               the color bearer takes position. Iles barks out a command; \n               the column forms into marching order. On the double quick, \n               the cavalry company starts out and on the way.\n\n               CLOSE SHOT of Haven as he watches; his eyes lighting a little, \n               the pipe in hand. We feel that he'd like to go too in this \n               moment.\n\n               ANOTHER ANGLE from Haven's view, as the column of cavalry \n               departs. Haven waves his hand, a half salute, a half gesture \n               to Iles as Iles salutes him in passing. Then only the dust \n               remains and Haven's gaze lingers. His face changes. It becomes \n               grim. He slowly knocks the ashes from the pipe, pockets it. \n               He slowly mounts the horse. He takes out his gun and checks \n               it. Then slowly he rides away, like a man on a mission he \n               dislikes but cannot evade.\n\n<b>               INT.

And just as he does so, Prince, in \n               the doorway, fires. Haven shoots so that the shots RING OUT \n               almost simultaneously.

SHOT of Haven and Charlie as their eyes read the dice. \n               Haven puts away the gun. Charlie is still leaning against \n               the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. A thin \n               smile for Haven. Now she sags a little and Haven realizes \n               she has been hit. He starts to her and she turns away towards \n               the couch. He catches her as she sags again, and helps her \n               down gently on the couch.\n\n               ANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her. He starts to pull \n               away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the \n               heart. She shakes her head.\n\n<b>                                     CHARLIE\n</b>                         It's no good...\n\n               Haven knows it.
