With a grunt,\n     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.\n\n     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the\n     steep steep hill.\n\n     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down\n     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.\n\n     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.\n\n                                                            CUT TO:\n\n\n59   EXT.

The bent bike\n     follows suit.\n\n     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9\n     and 5.6.\n\n     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.\n\n     Everything is still.\n\n     Then the car jolts forward.

The horn blares.\n\n     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.\n\n     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -\n     7.8.\n\n\n60   INT.

The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a\n     small slit of exposed skin.\n\n     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush\n     crosses her still face.\n\n     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.\n\n                            BLOOM (cont'd)\n                  Paris and Greece, I think.

So my mom took me into the\n                  doctor, and he did that test where\n                  they use needles to prick a grid on\n                  your back with all the different\n                  toxins, to see which ones you're\n                  allergic to. The next day I came\n                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,\n                  and my back looked like a patch of\n                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-\n                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic\n                  to everything. So they sealed the\n                  house with plastic and a special\n                  ventilation system, and I spent my\n                  entire childhood and adolescence\n                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.\n\n     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on\n     the table.\n\n\n  \n\n                                                              45\n\n73   CONTINUED: (2)                                            73\n\n\n                         BLOOM\n               Wow.\n\n                         PENELOPE\n               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they\n               discovered what I was actually\n               allergic to was the aluminum alloy\n               the hypodermic needle was made out\n               of. Then I was going to leave, but\n               my mom got sick. So I stayed.

So I\n               decided this wasn't a story about a\n               miserable girl trapped in a house\n               that smelled like medical supplies\n               wasting her life on a dying person\n               she sometimes hated. It was about\n               a girl who could find infinite\n               beauty in anything, any little\n               thing. And do anything she decided\n               to do. And love the person she was\n               trapped with. So I told myself\n               that story until it became true.\n               Now did doing that let me escape a\n               wasted life, or did it just blind\n               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?\n               I don't know.

At the\n     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the\n     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear\n     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.\n\n                         THE CURATOR\n               And a magician is just an actor\n               playing the part of a magician.

They\n                got very angry and his friend\n                pushed him a certain way and the\n                boy fell and struck his head and\n                died. The boy's friend was very\n                sad but also very frightened. So\n                instead of telling the boy's\n                parents, he did something awful.\n                He pulled the body into a quarry, a\n                pit of broken rocks, and hid the\n                boy beneath a pile of large stones.\n                Well. Years went by, and the boy's\n                friend became a young man, and one\n                day while drinking in town (which\n                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)\n                he heard that a well was being\n                built near the forest... with the\n                stones from the quarry. He ran to\n                the quarry to find it nearly\n                empty... no stones, no body. He\n                ran to the well where the masons\n                were finishing their work. `Did\n                they find anything strange in the\n                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe\n                hoping they'd arrest him for the\n                awful crime on the spot. But no,\n                they said, motioning to the well.\n                Nothing strange. Just stones.\n                They left him alone there at the\n                well, and he stood looking into it\n                as the sun fell behind the\n                mountains and twilight set the\n                world in a deep, still silence.\n\n      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.\n\n      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence\n      that follows.\n\n      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges\n      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by\n      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar\n      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.\n\n      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the\n      Curator, sitting very still.\n\n                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)\n                My daughter died nineteen years ago\n                today.

But no matter what I\n                said to her, I couldn't stop her\n                shaking, crying. Her last moments\n                on this earth were filled with\n                terror.

The book, encased in the plastic\n      bag, hangs from her teeth.\n\n      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.\n\n      Up ahead she sees a point of light.

Nods at our intrepid three.\n\n      And opens the door for Penelope.

A shiny red apple on a fruit\n      seller's cart.\n\n      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing\n      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.\n\n      Holy shit.

Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,\n      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.\n\n\n157   INT.

Penelope watches, horrified.\n\n      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house\n      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.\n\n      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.\n\n      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the\n      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.\n\n      And goes off with a deafening rapport.\n\n      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.\n\n      Penelope screams.\n\n      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of\n      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.\n\n                          STEPHEN\n                Tastes like tin foil.\n\n      And sinks to the ground.\n\n      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.

Tears in\n      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not\n      being a part of this moment.\n\n      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize\n      her.\n\n                             PENELOPE\n                Bloom...\n\n      He doesn't move from his brother.\n\n                             PENELOPE (cont'd)\n                I'm sorry.\n\n      She leaves.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 95\n   \n172   CONTINUED: (3)                                             172\n\n\n      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms\n      in the middle of the broken room.\n\n      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope\n      walking off into the distance down the beach.\n\n      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a\n      mask.\n\n      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and\n      blood packets.\n\n      Bloom steps outside.\n\n\n173   EXT.

Our fake Russian attack. One\n                   small charge will simulate a bullet\n                   hit, and blow out the back window.\n\n      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on\n      the rear windshield.\n\n                             STEPHEN (cont'd)\n                   So that one bang, then we roll off\n                   the road. Once we get clear of the\n                   car the Chink sets off the final\n                   charge, incinerating the car and\n                   the money in the trunk. This'll\n                   all happen exactly twenty seconds\n                   after we cross the main bridge out\n                   of town. After the bridge.\n\n      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his\n      jacket.\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   Ok.\n\n\n195   INT.

The Chink is\n      expressionless.\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   You've been awful quiet.\n\n      She doesn't react.\n\n                             BLOOM (cont'd)\n                   I'm doing this for her.\n\n      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.\n\n                                                                   107\n      \n\n\n\n\n196   INT.

Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.\n\n                          PENELOPE\n                Tomorrow it all starts.\n\n      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts\n      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her\n      for the last time.\n\n      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.\n\n\n197   EXT.

This is\n                taking too long.\n\n      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.\n\n\n199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199\n\n      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.\n      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.\n\n                          PENELOPE\n                He hassled me. Took forever\n                looking the book over, haggled the\n                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.\n\n      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.\n\n                           STEPHEN\n                Alright.

ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200\n\n      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.\n\n\n201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201\n\n      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.\n\n      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.\n\n      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.\n\n      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.\n      He breathes, closes his eyes.\n\n      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.\n\n      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.\n\n      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.\n\n      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,\n      screams, tires screeching.\n\n\n202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202\n\n      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire\n      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.\n\n      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment\n      full speed, launching into the air.\n\n\n203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203\n\n      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The\n      brothers lock eyes for a split second.\n\n\n204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204\n\n      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to\n      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an\n      abrupt stop against a stout tree.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   109\n      \n204   CONTINUED:                                                    204\n\n\n                             STEPHEN\n                   OUT!\n\n      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,\n      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car\n      becomes a roiling ball of flame.\n\n      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees\n      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of\n      the car.\n\n      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a\n      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches\n      down to him...\n\n      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.\n\n\n205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205\n\n      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.\n      Penelope hunches over him.\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   What happened?\n\n                             PENELOPE\n                   Are you alright?\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   What happened?\n\n                             PENELOPE\n                   Yeungling went to get another car.\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   Where's Stephen?\n\n                             PENELOPE\n                   We don't know.

Lying in the grass, a manila\n      envelope.\n\n                             PENELOPE (cont'd)\n                   We're going to find him. If he\n                   escaped, he'll contact us.

PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206\n\n      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,\n      loading his revolver with shaky fingers.

I don't know Stephen please.\n                   Please. What's happening. Please.\n\n      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot\n      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.\n\n      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.\n\n                             PENELOPE\n                   Where does she get all these cars?\n\n      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet\n      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.\n\n                             BLOOM\n                   If you know what's happening, now\n                   would be a really good time to\n                   speak up.\n\n      She sets a suitcase down beside her.

Anything I can\n                imagine finding in there, I'm\n                scared of.\n\n                          PENELOPE\n                I'm going to be here when you come\n                out.\n\n      She kisses him.\n\n      He puts his hand on the door.

Bloom\n      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.\n\n                           BLOOM\n                Stephen!\n\n\n219   INT.

He spins, trapped in its glare.\n\n      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.\n\n      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few\n      feet ahead of him towards the stage.\n\n      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and\n      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.\n\n      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.\n\n\n220   INT.

I'm alright.\n\n      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear\n      for a moment then flips it closed.\n\n      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily\n      stands, cut loose.\n\n                             STEPHEN (cont'd)\n                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm\n                   coming to you.\n\n      He takes a couple wobbly steps.\n\n      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun\n      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...\n\n      And the utility lamp switches off.\n\n                              BLOOM\n                   No!\n\n      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into\n      the blackness.\n\n      Stephen drops flat to the ground.\n\n      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,\n      strobing the scene like stage lightning.\n\n      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen\n      lies on his stomach out in the open.\n\n                              BLOOM (cont'd)\n                   Stephen!\n\n\n\n                                                                 121\n    \n220   CONTINUED: (2)                                              220\n\n\n                              STEPHEN\n                 Stay back!\n\n      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,\n      unloading three more rounds into the dark.\n\n      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full\n      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.\n\n      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.\n\n      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red\n      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.\n\n      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind\n      him.\n\n      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,\n      through the torn backdrop.\n\n      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires\n      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the\n      lobby.\n\n      Silence.\n\n      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,\n      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.\n\n                           BLOOM\n                 Please tell me this is all gonna be\n                 ok.

Then a wry grin spreads across his\n      face.\n\n                           STEPHEN\n                 You said it, not me.\n\n      He stands, the shakiness gone.\n\n                           STEPHEN (cont'd)\n                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?\n\n                           BLOOM\n                 You son of a bitch.\n\n\n\n\n                                                               122\n  \n220   CONTINUED: (3)                                            220\n\n\n      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he\n      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for\n      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.\n\n      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes\n      them, wipes blood from his lip.\n\n                          STEPHEN\n                Tastes like tin foil. Alright\n                here's what I want you to do.

Here's what. Take Penelope\n                back to Helsinki, take that flight\n                to Rio.
