So my mom took me into the\n                  doctor, and he did that test where\n                  they use needles to prick a grid on\n                  your back with all the different\n                  toxins, to see which ones you're\n                  allergic to. The next day I came\n                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,\n                  and my back looked like a patch of\n                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-\n                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic\n                  to everything. So they sealed the\n                  house with plastic and a special\n                  ventilation system, and I spent my\n                  entire childhood and adolescence\n                  indoors.

And love the person she was\n               trapped with. So I told myself\n               that story until it became true.\n               Now did doing that let me escape a\n               wasted life, or did it just blind\n               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?\n               I don't know.
