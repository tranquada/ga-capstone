This is\r\n          a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON\r\n          STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...\r\n          planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?\r\n                         \r\n          Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden\r\n          inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of\r\n          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.\r\n                         \r\n          The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,\r\n          spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it\r\n          contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.\r\n                         \r\n          The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into\r\n          the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,\r\n          racing back out from the black hole.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-\r\n          like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --\r\n          a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet\r\n          with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.\r\n                         \r\n          The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches\r\n          our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North\r\n          America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and\r\n          through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.\r\n                         \r\n          The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum\r\n          chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected\r\n          in a heavy piece of glass.\r\n                         \r\n          The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in\r\n          the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a\r\n          concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.\r\n                         \r\n          An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it\r\n          parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end\r\n          of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

It is the weekend\r\n          and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the\r\n          displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by\r\n          a series of echoes.\r\n                         \r\n          The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n           2. \r\n                         \r\n          INT.

We went\r\n           through the last year's data and\r\n           triangulated the source.\r\n                         \r\n          The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron\r\n          star circling into the black hole.\r\n                         \r\n                          NSA AGENT\r\n           We know that, Doctor.

Ms. Kelly here says\r\n           that Murph brought a book to school\r\n           about the lunar landings.\r\n                         \r\n          He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the\r\n          cover across the desk to Cooper.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           One of my old textbooks.

We've replaced them with\r\n           corrected versions.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Corrected?\r\n                         \r\n           MS. KELLY\r\n           The new textbooks explain that the\r\n           Apollo lunar missions were faked in\r\n           order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           You don't believe we went to the\r\n           moon?\r\n                         \r\n           MS. KELLY\r\n           I believe it was a brilliant piece\r\n           of propaganda. The Soviets spent\r\n           years trying to build rockets and\r\n           other useless machines.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           \"Useless machines\"?\r\n           18.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper looks to the Principal for help.

The kind of\r\n           wastefulness and excess that the\r\n           20th century represented. Your\r\n           children would be better off learning\r\n           about this planet, rather than reading\r\n           fantasies about leaving it.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper is silent for a long moment.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           One of those useless machines they\r\n           used to make was called an MRI.

And\r\n           then my kids could have been raised\r\n           by two parents, instead of me and\r\n           their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.\r\n                         \r\n          Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen.

Jumps down.\r\n                         \r\n          He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying\r\n          to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.\r\n                         \r\n          Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike\r\n          the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault\r\n          code and resets the computer.\r\n                         \r\n          The man jogs over to meet him.\r\n                         \r\n                          RIGGS\r\n           Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em\r\n           took off last night, looking for\r\n           something.\r\n           (points to dunes)\r\n           Looks like they found it, too.

Cooper follows.\r\n                         \r\n          Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming\r\n          vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping\r\n          at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater.\r\n           20.\r\n                         \r\n          As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself,\r\n          trying to reach the crater.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal.\r\n          He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides\r\n          down into the hole.\r\n                         \r\n          The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it.

It bothers me that he doesn't\r\n           care.\r\n                         \r\n                          DONALD\r\n           Tom isn't the problem. He fits in\r\n           this world just fine. You're the\r\n           one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't\r\n           belong here. You were born forty\r\n           years too late, or forty years too\r\n           early -- I don't know. My daughter\r\n           knew it, god bless her. And your\r\n           kids know it, too.\r\n                         \r\n          Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door.

But\r\n           that's not your kids' fault.\r\n                         \r\n          Donald pushes out the screen door.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper looks at his beer.

BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding\r\n          a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him.\r\n           24.\r\n                         \r\n          The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a\r\n          DEAFENING SCREAM.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He\r\n          hits it with the paddles. No result.\r\n                         \r\n          He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and\r\n          AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table\r\n          and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front\r\n          door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It\r\n          stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once\r\n          again, the movement shuts it up.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Murph\r\n          looks up, sees the stars overhead.\r\n                         \r\n                          MURPH\r\n           Try a different direction.\r\n                         \r\n          As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then\r\n          picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps\r\n          it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           It's a fail-safe. It's going to\r\n           annoy us into taking it home.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins\r\n          SHRIEKING again.\r\n                         \r\n                          TOM\r\n           What are we going to do?\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper gets a rope.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           We're going to get some sleep.\r\n                         \r\n          He begins tying the rope around the probe.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around\r\n          his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant.\r\n           25.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

Murph, still suspended,\r\n          looks up at Cooper, smiling.\r\n                         \r\n                          MURPH\r\n           What are we doing today?\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           You're staying here and cleaning the\r\n           house.\r\n                         \r\n          Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard.\r\n          Cooper follows his stare.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER (CONT'D)\r\n           I told you, Murph.

Murph scrambles to get his shoes.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well,\r\n          putting in a pair of earplugs.\r\n                         \r\n          A line is staked off, leading down into the well below.\r\n          Cooper begins hauling the line up.\r\n                         \r\n          As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK\r\n          returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out\r\n          onto the ground.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it\r\n          did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa\r\n          Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken\r\n          and burned what was left of the homes in between.\r\n           26.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up\r\n          to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and\r\n          disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become\r\n          ranchland, once again.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and\r\n          checks it over.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Got any diesel?\r\n                         \r\n                          OLD MAN\r\n           Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows\r\n          the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat,\r\n          the probe is HUMMING.\r\n                         \r\n          A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA\r\n          CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.\r\n                         \r\n          As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent.\r\n                         \r\n                          MURPH\r\n           I think it's home.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat\r\n          grassland in the center of the island.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

Cooper slings a\r\n          rifle over his shoulder.\r\n                         \r\n          A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line.\r\n          Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with\r\n          bright red -- strawberries.\r\n                         \r\n                          MURPH\r\n           Dad, what are these things?\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           I don't know. Don't touch them.\r\n           27.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a\r\n          little off. He walks over.\r\n                         \r\n          He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS\r\n          against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage\r\n          scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical\r\n          transport truck.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER (CONT'D)\r\n           Murph?\r\n                         \r\n          He looks around. Murph is nowhere to be seen. Cooper curses\r\n          and heads into the forest to look for him.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings.\r\n          Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk\r\n          of the tree is red hot.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged\r\n          chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive\r\n          tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some\r\n          kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a\r\n          clearing.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Careful.

Its alloy\r\n          frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like\r\n          it might have been standing here for decades.\r\n           28.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes.\r\n          He steps back, clearly a little spooked.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER (CONT'D)\r\n           I think we need to go, Murph.\r\n                         \r\n                          MURPH\r\n           But can't we take it back?

One problem -- the engine\r\n          isn't there. Their programming hasn't been updated to reflect\r\n          their obsolescence.\r\n                         \r\n          Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about their\r\n          business, efficiently TORQUING bolts with impact drivers\r\n          into a non-existent thruster cone.

She\r\n          finally relents and walks towards the door.\r\n                         \r\n          Brand walks in.

As he a does, a control panel on the wall\r\n          TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.\r\n                         \r\n          He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the\r\n          open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play.\r\n          He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before\r\n          he can, the door opens behind him.\r\n                         \r\n          A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOCTOR\r\n           Good morning.

Swallows the pill.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)\r\n           Wait a minute for that to take effect.\r\n           It can be a bit of an adjustment.\r\n           (looks him over)\r\n           You had some frostbite.

But as the\r\n          road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the\r\n          landscape curves up, not down.\r\n                         \r\n          The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder-\r\n          shaped space station.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out.

A thousand\r\n          feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of\r\n          green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOCTOR (CONT'D)\r\n           I've got someone who wants to meet\r\n           you.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper looks at her.\r\n                         \r\n          INT.

The room is dark, still, the only noise\r\n          is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper-\r\n          thin. He is ancient.\r\n                         \r\n                          DOCTOR\r\n           He was moved here after they found\r\n           you. He's a little old for a\r\n           transfer, but they made an exception.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to\r\n          the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on\r\n          the old man's desk:\r\n                         \r\n          There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then\r\n          the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents.\r\n          Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:\r\n                         \r\n          Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her\r\n          family.

He steps over to the bed and\r\n          looks down at the ancient man, teetering on the edge of death.\r\n                         \r\n          The old man looks at him, eyes widening in excitement. He\r\n          strains, trying to reach the bedside table. He's trying to\r\n          reach the drawer. Cooper helps him open it.\r\n                         \r\n          Inside is a simple, familiar wristwatch. The old man\r\n          carefully takes out the watch. He gives the watch a few\r\n          winds and, hands shaking, offers it to Cooper.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper, eyes filling with tears, closes his hand over the\r\n          old man's hand, enveloping both the watch and the man's hand.\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged\r\n          BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's\r\n           just start off by saying that. It's\r\n           an incredible and... unexpected honor\r\n           to have you here with us.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\r\n           None of us would be here without the\r\n           efforts of you and the other\r\n           crewmembers of the Endurance.\r\n           (smiles, unconvincingly)\r\n           So I don't want you to take this the\r\n           wrong way. But there are some\r\n           questions I've been told to ask.\r\n                         \r\n          The man looks petrified, like he's been instructed to grill\r\n          George Washington on his expense reports.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Shoot.\r\n           149.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           The rangers who found you reported\r\n           that you had released a sample of an\r\n           alien life-form into the wild. Which\r\n           is, unfortunately, against\r\n           regulations.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           It was last of its kind. Their planet\r\n           was destroyed.\r\n                         \r\n          The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           The rangers attempted to isolate the\r\n           life-form, but it had already spread\r\n           out of control. It seems to be\r\n           thriving.\r\n                         \r\n          He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A\r\n          considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even\r\n          less comfortable.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\r\n           Can you tell me why you... elected\r\n           to release the life-form back on\r\n           earth?\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper is still laughing.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Because that was the plan.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           Whose plan?\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n                          (SMILES)\r\n           I don't know.\r\n                         \r\n          The administrator tries to smile back. Makes a few notes in\r\n          his file. Changes the subject.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           My assistant tells me you've applied\r\n           for a position with the exploration\r\n           fleet.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Feel like I should be pulling my\r\n           weight.\r\n           150.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The\r\n           truth is, most of the fleet's\r\n           personnel are automated. There are\r\n           a small number of crewed ships. But\r\n           there are great numbers of candidates.\r\n           Very well trained candidates.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           I was hoping to enroll in a course.\r\n           Try to get myself up to speed on the\r\n           new systems.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           I don't want you to take this the\r\n           wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I\r\n           said, you're a hero. But the truth\r\n           is we have somewhat limited resources.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper remembers this conversation.

I just need\r\n           a small ship. I made a promise.\r\n                         \r\n          The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to\r\n          tell this guy the lay of the land?\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR\r\n           Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.\r\n           You're the oldest man in the human\r\n           race. Don't you want to take it\r\n           easy?\r\n           (off his look)\r\n           I hope you understand, we all you\r\n           hold you in the highest possible\r\n           regard.\r\n                          (QUIET)\r\n           Which is why they're never going to\r\n           let you go off by yourself in a\r\n           spaceship. I'm sorry.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper looks at his hands. He's got a couple centuries on\r\n          the bureaucrat in Earth years, but looks ten years younger.\r\n          He puts his hands in his pockets.\r\n           151.\r\n                         \r\n                          ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D)\r\n           I've got some good news, however.\r\n                          (BIG SMILE)\r\n           We all know about your early life,\r\n           Mr Cooper.

A red tractor makes its\r\n          way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance.\r\n                         \r\n           ADMINISTRATOR (V.O.)\r\n           The machines do most of the work, of\r\n           course, but we were able to get you\r\n           a few acres.

Looks at the front steering linkage, which is\r\n          jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead\r\n          and begins working the branch out of the machine.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks miserable.\r\n                         \r\n          A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. Offers Cooper\r\n          a bottle of water. Cooper accepts it.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar\r\n          floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb\r\n          into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack\r\n          of the bat as an intramural team from the university\r\n          practices.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper watches. He looks bored.\r\n                         \r\n          The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher\r\n          shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.\r\n          But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.\r\n                         \r\n          Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward\r\n          the town center above.\r\n                         \r\n          After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a\r\n          building high above them.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing.\r\n           152.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling\r\n          around in the back of his head.\r\n                         \r\n                          ROBOT\r\n           Settings: general settings, security\r\n                          SETTINGS--\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Curiosity.

FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before.\r\n          They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of\r\n          alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the\r\n          cylinder into shade, then darkness.\r\n                         \r\n          The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION\r\n                         \r\n          A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-\r\n          looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.\r\n                         \r\n          After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar\r\n          floor, sticking to the shadows.\r\n                         \r\n          As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better\r\n          look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing\r\n          a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with\r\n          a click against the mirror-like floor.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his\r\n          finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the\r\n          ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.\r\n          Nothing happens. He punches in a few more.\r\n           153.\r\n                         \r\n          Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS.\r\n                         \r\n          INT. SHIP\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over\r\n          the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him.\r\n          Cooper looks up through the windows.\r\n                         \r\n          The inky black void of space beckons.\r\n                         \r\n          Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.\r\n                         \r\n                          COOPER\r\n           Where do you want to go first?\r\n                         \r\n          The robot thinks it over.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION\r\n                         \r\n          The technician walks back into the hangar. He walks along\r\n          the row of ships till he reaches the last one.\r\n                         \r\n          It's not there.\r\n                         \r\n          He looks out into the blackness of the void. Sees a tiny\r\n          glowing speck, getting smaller and smaller.\r\n                         \r\n                         END\r\n                          \r\n\r\n\n\n\n\nInterstellar\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Jonathan Nolan\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Adventure\u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Sci-Fi\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:27:41.531376"}
