A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON\n1                                                                 1\n    A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way\n    through a gray sky before being obliterated.\n4\n    A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge\n    of a boat and into the ocean.\n                                                  D\n    UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are\n    FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.\n\n    He breaks the surface and gasps for air.\n\n    He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the\n    tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried\n    beneath the dark ocean water.\n\n    EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS\n2                                                                 2\n\n    A floating tenement.\n    A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims\n    into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its\n    grip.\n\n    EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS                                   3\n3\n    The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.\n\n    He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.\n\n    AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over\n    on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he\n    DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a\n    labored lobster-walk.\n\n    He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge\n    of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white\n    and flaccid.\n\n    A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to\n    him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of\n    scotch and begins drinking.\n\n                                                   ISSOLVE TO:\n\n    INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                      4\n\n    The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.\n\n    He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.\n\n                                                                2.\n\n    Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,\n    with his hair neatly trimmed.\n\n    Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,\n    overwhelmed with mutual desire.\n\n    He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all\n    over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.\n\n    He kisses her passionately on the mouth.\n\n                        MAN\n              Oh, my dear...\n\n    His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She\n    begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around\n    her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his\n    hands to the laces and together they undo it.\n\n                        WOMAN\n                  (whispering softly)\n              It's all right, darling.

DINING ROOM - MORNING\n\n    Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid\n    off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours\n    himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.\n\n    He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.\n\n                        WOMAN (O.S.)\n              I could not be more delighted to have\n              received your most charming letter.\n              It has been far too long since we last\n              corresponded.

SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\n    ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous\n    eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary\n    intelligence and depth.\n\n                        ELEANOR\n              Unfortunately, I would be of little\n              assistance to the Junior Assistance\n              League. Particularly if my purpose\n              were to appear as an alumna who is\n              gifted at public speaking.\n\n    She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a\n    head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is\n    Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.\n\n    She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.\n\n                        LUCY\n              And what do you really want me to say?\n\n                        ELEANOR\n              Thank you and if you ask again I\n              shall scream?\n\n                                                          4.\n\nThey share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely\nrumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.\n\n                    LOUIS\n          Why don't you ask your husband for\n          some pointers? He's a pretty gifted\n          public speaker, don't you think?\n\nLOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and\nunlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --\npart consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind\nwhat he believes will be the greatest political career of the\ntwentieth century.\n\nHe gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles\noff his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.\n\n                    LOUIS\n          You should get out once in a while.\n          Accepting that invitation would be\n          good for Franklin's career.\n\n                    ELEANOR\n          Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more\n          comfortable waiting for my husband\n          outside?\n\n                    LOUIS\n          In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?\n\n                    ELEANOR\n          If you like.\n\nEleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters\nfrom the dining room.\n\n                    FRANKLIN\n          I see it's not even eight a.m.\n          and already the gloves are off.\n              (kissing Eleanor on the\n               cheek)\n          Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss\n          Mercer.   L\n                     UCY\n          Good morning, sir.\n\nQuickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.\n\n                    LOUIS\n              (annoyed)\n          You're late. Honestly, why do you\n          enjoy keeping people waiting?\n\n                                                                5.\n\n                        FRANKLIN\n              Because they always seem more\n              grateful to see me when I arrive.\n\n    He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.\n\n                        FRANKLIN\n              Have a lovely day, Babs.\n\n                        ELEANOR\n              Should I expect you for dinner?\n\n                        FRANKLIN\n              I have the Navy reception this\n              evening. I'll be home quite late.\n              Unless you've changed your mind\n              about coming?\n\n    Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing\n    furiously.\n\n                        ELEANOR\n              Do you wish me to come?\n\n                        FRANKLIN\n              Well... whatever you'd like.\n\n                        ELEANOR\n                  (a beat)\n              Thank you, no.\n\n                        FRANKLIN\n              Very well then.\n                  (tipping his hat)\n              Good day, Miss Mercer.\n\n    Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the\n    ladies and follows him out.\n\n    EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.

Louis struggles to keep up while\n    consulting a small appointment book.\n\n                        LOUIS\n              At ten you've got a meeting with\n              representatives from Pittsburgh\n              Steel.

His hair is a mess and his clothing is\n     slightly askew.\n\n     As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness.\n     They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening\n     to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.\n\n11                                                                11\n     INT. UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING\n\n     Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the\n     stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then\n     goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her.\n\n     INT.

She brings the packet, tied\n     with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by\n     their familiar scent.\n\n     With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down\n     her cheeks as she reads.\n\n     Franklin opens his eyes.\n\n                                                       CUT TO:\n\n     EXT.

It is\n     surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal\n     paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River.\n\n     THE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn\n     playing a boisterous game of croquet.\n\n     INT.

Franklin looks out the window at\n     African-American FIELD HANDS hard at work in the red clay\n     hills of Georgia.\n\n                         ELEANOR\n               James has been doing so much better\n               now that Elliot has joined him at\n               Groton. They've put their\n               differences behind them and have\n               become a real team.\n\n     Franklin observes two YOUNG BOYS, African-American, running\n     alongside the slow-moving train.\n\n                          ELEANOR\n               Two peas in a pod. Last week they\n               were both in the infirmary with the\n     F         same cold.\n\n      ranklin eyes a wagon pulled by a mule. The driver, a FARMER,\n     takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun.\n\n                          LEANOR\n               Meanwhile, any suggestion I make to\n               Anna for her future -- she\n               dismisses me. I am going to have to\n               enlist your support in this,\n               Franklin. She listens to you.\n\n     She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the\n     window, deep in thought -- not having heard a word she's said.\n\n                                                              26.\n\n     EXT.

Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few\n     words whose poker face hides a true desperation. He holds a\n     telegram from Franklin in his hand.\n\n     As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the\n     passengers making their exit.\n\n     There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked\n     WHITE and COLORED. Whites exit from the front of the train\n     and Blacks from the rear.\n\n     LIONEL PURDY, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform,\n     approaches Tom. Of indeterminate age and dubious intellect,\n     his mail bag is almost as big as he is.\n\n                         LIONEL\n               Someone important?\n\n                         TOM\n               You might say so, Lionel.\n\n                         LIONEL\n               Who?\n\n                         TOM\n               A Mr. Roosevelt.\n\n                         LIONEL\n               Teddy?\n\n                         TOM\n                   (patiently)\n               No, he's dead.\n\n                         LIONEL\n               Oh.\n\n     The STATIONMASTER approaches.\n\n                         STATIONMASTER\n               Tom, your guest needs some\n               assistance.

His brother\n     PETE, 27, is close behind, carrying luggage -- both hover at\n     around 6' 4\".\n\n     Tom approaches. Franklin attempts to hide his embarrassment\n     with good cheer.\n\n                         FRANKLIN\n               Hello! Hello!

Pete follows.\n\n                         ROY\n                   (to Tom)\n               There's a trunk and a chair with\n               the wheels, too.\n\n                         TOM\n               I'll send a wagon right over.\n\n                         PETE\n               We got a wagon, sir.\n\n     EXT.

In\n     occasional clearings, Franklin spies barefoot children\n     playing out in front of broken-down shacks. They stop their\n     play to look at the car.\n\n                         FRANKLIN\n                   (covering his discomfort)\n               Beautiful country.\n\n                         ELEANOR\n               How long have you been manager of\n               the Inn?\n\n                           TOM\n               Not long.\n\n     They BANG over a large pothole.

Franklin has a brochure for\n     \"The Meriwether Inn\" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the\n     building through the trees but cannot.\n\n     He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish\n     Victorian Hotel and the words, \"Our renowned mineral hot\n     springs can cure whatever ails you!\"\n\n     Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and\n     yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is\n     peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown\n     with weeds.\n\n     The car pulls to a stop.\n\n                         TOM\n               You'll have a great deal of\n               privacy.
