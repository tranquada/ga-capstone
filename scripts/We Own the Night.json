EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM\n          \n          A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,\n          pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,\n          straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,\n          fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.\n          Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he\n          appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his\n          name. He is having a blast.\n          \n          Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of\n          Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.\n          He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S \"HEART OF GLASS.\"\n          Bobby waves hello to people, greets them (\"Hey, baby!\"), a\n          pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a\n          swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,\n          claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES\n          every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.\n          WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN.\n          \n                                                               (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                  3.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n          A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,\n          surrounded by his gang: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Thirty-five, acne-\n          scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,\n          PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.\n          \n          NEAR THE COAT CHECK\n          \n          Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we\n          SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,\n          slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their\n          coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.\n          Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian\n          with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of\n          it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the\n          DRUG TRADE.\n          \n          INT. THE FRONT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT - LOBBY\n          \n          A HUGE FIGHT that's breaking out. Violent. Club patrons\n          and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO\n          moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,\n          forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around\n          him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says \"SECURITY\" on it.\n          He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby\n          arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       What the fuck's goin' on in here?\n          \n          Bobby moves RIGHT IN. Grabs a struggling and drunk PATRON,\n          puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE\n          TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,\n          watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly\n          detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He\n          balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding\n          spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing\n          his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:\n          \n                                      LOUIS FALSETTI\n                       Okay, Bobkes! Looks like you got\n                       everything under control here--so\n                       uh, so I'm gonna go outside, take\n                       my break!\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       Yeah--just keep that wide load of\n                       yours outta trouble, arright?\n          \n                                      LOUIS FALSETTI\n                       Yes, your fuckin' majesty!\n          \n          The Patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from\n          Bobby's grip. Bobby looks down at him. With humor:\n          \n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                     4.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       What're you doing?!? You gotta\n                       behave yourself here!\n          \n          Gives the guy a shot in the head. Meanwhile: LOUIS\n          saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen\n          drunk. He BOWS in triumph when others applaud his leap.\n          Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE\n          helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is\n          flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON\n          HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who\n          hurls his guy out of frame):\n          \n                                      BLOODIED PATRON\n                       C'mon, Mr. Green! I didn't do\n                       nothing!\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN\n                       Well now you're gonna do nothing\n                       someplace else!\n                              (louder, to all\n                               fighters; pointing:)\n                       Now listen--one of these days I'm\n                       gonna run this whole block, and I\n                       see any you in here again--any you--\n                       I'll bust your fuckin' hole!\n                              (to Freddie)\n                       Throw `em out on their ass. I\n                       gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys\n                       with the old man.\n          \n          INT. STAIRWELL\n          \n          Wood-panelled walls. Bobby walks upstairs, fixing his hair.\n          \n          INT. MARAT BUZHAYEV'S APARTMENT - FOYER/LIVING ROOM\n          \n          An ornate, gaudy place. The walls are covered by mirrors\n          with that cheesy brown marble pattern print all over them.\n          Plush couches, clutter. Bobby walks in.\n          \n          We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played\n          downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits\n          MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,\n          kindly, weakened by age; sits next to his babushka wife,\n          KALINA. Buzhayev watches a Russian musical program with\n          the sound off, listening to his small transistor radio.\n          \n                                       MARAT BUZHAYEV\n                       Bobby!

The two EMBRACE\n          WARMLY--they are close. Before separating, Buzhayev\n          touches his face. KALINA yells happily in RUSSIAN, grabs\n          BOBBY, embraces him too. She couldn't be more motherly,\n          amd Bobby BEAMS at the treatment.\n          \n                                       KALINA BUZHAYEV (SUBTITLE)\n                       So beautiful!   Beautiful!\n          \n          Bobby is moved, almost embarrassed by the loving attention.\n          Then, gently dropping a set of KEYS on a side table:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       Listen, Mr. Buzhayev--I gotta go do\n                       something right now. But don't\n                       worry--everything's in good shape\n                       downstairs.\n          \n                                       MARAT BUZHAYEV\n                              (warm, gentle)\n                       Yes, good. You take care of things\n                       good for us...\n          \n          Marat smiles.    Then, as Bobby stands:\n          \n                                      MARAT BUZHAYEV (CONT'D)\n                       Next week, you come by--we talk.\n                       Okay? We talk about plans for you.\n          \n          Bobby lights up, nods. Marat pats his cheek. Kalina tries\n          to give him a small care package of food. He politely\n          refuses, and a minor and friendly AD-LIBBED argument in\n          Russian (\"He said he didn't want any food, and you keep\n          trying to give it to him!\") breaks out between the old\n          husband and his wife. As Bobby exits:\n          \n                                      KALINA BUZHAYEV\n                             (broken English)\n                       Bobby!

A large room with columns.\n          Streamers, balloons everywhere. Old cops, young cops, men,\n          women, are here. Skinny, portly, giddy, drunk.\n          \n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   6.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Many are IN UNIFORM, loosened up a bit, like they've just\n          gotten off work and it's time to relax. Children run\n          about. American, New York State flags. Pictures on the\n          walls: people with plaques, portraits. ARCHIE BUNKER'S NEW\n          YORK. A SIGN READS: \"CONGRATULATIONS!

Lots and lots of beer.\n          \n          Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making\n          sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT,\n          GAB, MAKE OUT.

The CAMERA DOLLIES PAST: JOSEPH and his\n          family, and JACK, and MICHAEL, then past ROSARIO, and BURT,\n          and BOBBY. The bell stops. The SEA of BLUE, the POLICE,\n          genuflect. Our characters do not. Instead, BOBBY STARES\n          at JOSEPH AND BURT across the crowded room. They return\n          the glare, and Bobby exits...\n          \n          EXT.

The women make\n          themselves up en masse in front of a large mirror over the\n          sofa. A couple KISSES in the corner. Everyone's getting\n          ready for a night of revelry on the town. They are\n          SINGING, having a GREAT TIME. The decor is late `70's,\n          though not exaggeratedly so.

Bobby is\n          PRIMPING in the mirror. Rosario stands on Bobby's king\n          bed, DANCING SENSUALLY to the music in a state of partial\n          undress. She MOVES with great FREEDOM, puffing on a JOINT.\n          \n                                   ROSARIO DIAZ\n                    I'm gonna be like Madonna.

REVEALS\n          THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in CASH, hidden underneath a fake\n          drawer bottom. Traces his fingers across the money with\n          private pride, then puts on the watch. Rosario bounces\n          down on the bed. Reaching under the bed sneakily, she\n          pulls out a small box. She hides it.

Starts kissing her on\n          the neck, lips, then breasts. Caressing her hips, he leans\n          back and looks at her, observing the brightness and\n          kindness of her face. Her eyes--mild, calm, and truthful--\n          and her smile carry him into a wave of tenderness. He\n          moves in to kiss her again, and under his breath:\n          \n                                        ROSARIO DIAZ\n                       WAIT--\n          \n          She takes out a little JEWELRY BOX.\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                 19.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          \n                                   ROSARIO DIAZ (CONT'D)\n                    I got you something.\n          \n                                     BOBBY GREEN\n                    What is it?\n          \n                                     ROSARIO DIAZ\n                    Open it up!\n          \n          He opens it.

MEN'S ROOM - FLASHBACK\n          \n          It's the men's room in the club. Louis is in the stall,\n          his pants pulled down. He HEARS: Nezhinski's voice and a\n          muffled struggle. Louis immediately pulls his feet up,\n          squatting on the toilet seat. Looks into the crack in the\n          stall door. We STILL HEAR:\n          \n                                     LOUIS FALSETTI\n                      Nezhinski dragged him into the\n                      toilet. They stood him up against\n                      the wall and held him--\n          \n          We SEE exactly this. Nezhinski faces the MAN. Two\n          associates of Nezhinski's hold him back, covering his mouth\n          with silver electrical tape.\n          \n                                     LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)\n                      They fuckin' pulled down his pants,\n                      and I swear to God, Nezhinski just\n                      cut it off.\n          \n          Nezhinski's associates pull down his pants, and Louis sees\n          the man's bare ass. The man is panicking, muffled cries\n          for help penetrating even the flashback. Nezhinski pulls\n          out his switchblade, holds it up to his face, then LOWERS\n          IT. A GLINT of REFLECTION on the KNIFE. HORRIBLE.\n          \n          INT.

There's a lot of food around\n          Vadim--he's   eating off six different plates. Bobby is\n          really only   focused on Rosario. When Rosario sees him\n          (she'd been   counting bills) she brightens, virtually\n          getting out   of her seat:\n          \n                                      ROSARIO DIAZ\n                       Hi, honey!\n          \n                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI\n                       Bobby--c'mon, join us!

Rosario kisses him, grabs onto his arm; Vadim\n          puts his arm around Bobby's shoulder.

JESSIE THE COP takes\n          out a ketchup squeeze bottle--except it's black--and\n          forcibly fills Bobby's mouth with charcoal:\n          \n                                   PARAMEDIC\n                    Arright, open up--a little\n                    charcoal, to absorb the toxin...\n          \n          \n          \n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                       31.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n          As Bobby gags, JOSEPH walks through the club with\n          confidence. The place, though absolutely packed, is\n          uncharacteristically SILENT. He turns to UNIFORMED COP #2:\n          \n                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY\n                       Give everybody a toss. G.Q.--\n          \n          This gets Mike's attention. Joseph signals something to\n          him, he nods, moves to the back. Joseph walks over to\n          LOUIS, pokes his gut:\n          \n                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Too much pizza, right there.\n          \n          Several COPS laugh. Then: Joseph SEES Bobby, and vice\n          versa. CLOSE SHOT on JOSEPH. He sobers, his brashness\n          muted. Joe walks toward Vadim and his party. Vadim has\n          his face to the wall. Joseph kicks his legs further apart.\n          (Joseph takes his frustration about his brother out on\n          Vadim.) In Russian, SUBTITLED:\n          \n                                        JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Turn around...    Turn around!\n          \n          Vadim turns around. Joseph starts to search him.          He pulls\n          a WAD OF MONEY from Vadim's pocket:\n          \n                                      JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       What is this?\n                              (BEAT)\n                       Want me to double your money? Huh?\n          \n          Vadim doesn't answer. Joseph takes out a HUGE SWISS ARMY\n          KNIFE he's got on his keychain. He cuts the wad in half.\n          \n                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Okay.   It's doubled now, how's\n                       that.\n          \n          Michael and Jack search the other members of Vadim's party.\n          They rip out pockets. Michael points to a WOMAN'S FUR:\n          \n                                      MICHAEL SOLO\n                       You got anything in there?\n          \n          He motions for the MINK. She hands it over.       HE PATS IT\n          DOWN CAREFULLY. NOTHING.\n          \n          ACROSS THE ROOM\n          \n          The Uniformed Cop puts handcuffs on Bobby and others.\n          Rosario watches, upset but powerless. Louis is down, next\n          to Bobby. Unwittingly referring to Bobby's brother:\n          \n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                    32.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          \n                                   LOUIS FALSETTI\n                    Jesus, that cop's crazy!\n          \n                                   UNIFORMED COP\n                    Hey!

Shut your\n                    fuckin' mouth!\n          \n          SEVERAL OFFICERS charge through now, PULLING THE LATINO MAN\n          AND THE YOUNG DARK-SKINNED WHITE MAN (in cuffs) from behind\n          the coat check. Bobby is pulled up, on his feet.\n          \n          BACK TO\n          \n          Joseph interrogating Vadim.   As he looks through I.D.:\n          \n                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (SUBTITLE)\n                    You got a cross AND a Jewish star\n                    on you?\n          \n                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI (SUBTITLE)\n                    The cross is for good luck.\n          \n                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY\n                    What's the star for?\n          \n                                   VADIM NEZHINSKI\n                    That one's for God.\n          \n          Just then, MICHAEL SOLO interjects.   In Joseph's ear:\n          \n                                   MICHAEL SOLO\n                    Coupla dimes on `em--cocaine, a\n                    little PCP.\n          \n          Joseph nods, acknowledging this news.    He EYES Vadim, then\n          turns to the TWO MEN:\n          \n                                    JOSEPH GRUSINSKY\n                    Okay, let's go. You. And you--\n                           (to the Young Man)\n                    You're under arrest, possession and\n                    sale of narcotics--\n          \n          Michael reads two other men, one of whom is a TALL MAN from\n          near the table (a lookout, perhaps), their Miranda rights\n          in a totally perfunctory manner. Almost mumbles them.\n          \n          PARAMEDICS exit the WOMEN'S ROOM.   Girls are on STRETCHERS.\n          \n          MARAT BUZHAYEV enters the main room of the club. He is\n          ESCORTED by TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS, who are very obviously\n          NOT ARRESTING HIM. They are asking him questions and\n          writing down his comments. He TURNS TO SEE:\n          \n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                 33.\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n          \n          \n          A HUMILIATED BOBBY, who eyes him back. Bobby is then\n          quickly ushered out along with tens of others. Marat\n          watches, as does Rosario. Louis and Rosario are left\n          behind, not having been arrested. Neither has VADIM.\n          Joseph moves close to Vadim. With arrogant brio, re: the\n          Dark-Skinned White Man, in Russian, subtitled:\n          \n                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                    Your boy's gonna turn. And then\n                    we'll come back for you.\n          \n          JOSEPH EYES VADIM, virtually mocking him. VADIM EYES JOE\n          BACK with SILENT RAGE on his face. Then the cops push THE\n          YOUNG DARK-SKINNED MAN out, and as they do, he turns back\n          to Vadim. The Young Man is TERRIFIED. Bobby, too, is\n          hauled out like a common criminal. Cuffed...\n          \n          INT. POLICE SERVICE AREA NUMBER TWO - HOLDING CELLS\n          \n          The station: 1980's-era, very unlike ones seen on T.V. The\n          walls are tan brick, peppered with fallout shelter signs.\n          Archaic, Robert Moses era-like. Lit entirely by large\n          fluorescents overhead, noticeably free of those desks and\n          typewriters that are familiar to us from other cop movies.\n          A big sign above a bulletin board reads, \"WE OWN THE\n          NIGHT.\" Bobby is led in by a PORTLY COP. A madhouse.\n          There is BLOOD all over the floor, forming a LAKE.\n          \n                                   PORTLY COP\n                    Jesus Christ, what the hell's goin'\n                    on in here?\n          \n          The Young Dark-Skinned Man is right outside the cell, his\n          body in spasm, covered with blood coursing from his neck.\n          Cops huddle around him as he kicks and screams.\n          \n                                   UNIFORMED COP\n                    Russian guy fuckin' slashed\n                    himself!\n          \n          After seeing this, Bobby is shoved in his cell, his nose\n          still leaking the charcoal, blood all over his shoes.\n          After a beat, he lies down on the cot...\n          \n          EXT.

Into the\n          LIVING ROOM, he sees Masha and ELI seated on the couch,\n          holding the hand of their son, who is dressed in a striped\n          suit. Upon seeing Bobby, ELI NODS TO HIM and Masha enters\n          the foyer, greeting Bobby with a kiss on both cheeks and\n          taking the wrapped present from him.\n          \n          INT.

Looks almost like\n          an old-time Klansman, with two holes cut into the hood for\n          his eyes. He's pointing a GUN RIGHT AT JOSEPH. Joseph's\n          eyes pop, and he lets out a quick gasp--but he has no real\n          time to react. The man pulls the trigger.\n          A THUNDERCLAP slaps the silence in the neighborhood:   THE\n          GUN HAS FIRED.

BOBBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          SMOKE AND DRINK everywhere. MADONNA'S \"DRESS YOU UP\" plays\n          in the background. CROWDED. Bobby, Rosario, and Louis are\n          at the center of a poker game. Lou sits next to Bobby,\n          partnering with him in the game and whispering into his ear\n          from time to time. Rosario sits next to Bobby and watches\n          the game intently.\n          \n          The poker pot seems exceptionally large. A STOCKY LATINO\n          MAN is the main one competing with Bobby. Bobby's a mess,\n          maybe worse than we've yet seen him. But he is HAPPILY\n          DRUNK, his eyes BLOODSHOT. He and Louis look at their\n          cards. Rosario turns, looks at Bobby for a BEAT. She sees\n          a small bruise he's got on his forehead, kisses it.\n          \n                                   ROSARIO DIAZ\n                    Baby, you got a little bruise here--\n          \n                                   BOBBY GREEN\n                    That ain't nothing.\n          \n          He starts rubbing her between the legs, under the table.\n          She kisses his bruise again. Louis pokes her. Smiling and\n          pointing to his crotch:\n          \n                                   LOUIS FALSETTI\n                    I got a bruise too, you know--right\n                    here!\n          \n          Rosario lets out a loud laugh.

The PHONE IS RINGING. A LOT.\n          ROSARIO gets up, walks over to the phone near the sofa and\n          picks up with a soft \"hello\". Meanwhile, Bobby puts a\n          whole lot of cash in the middle. The Latino Man looks at\n          him like he's crazy. Finally:\n          \n          \n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                    42.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                                      STOCKY LATINO MAN\n                       Call.\n          \n          Bobby takes a SHOT OF LIQUOR.

As he does so, Louis, to some girl, proudly:\n          \n                                      LOUIS FALSETTI\n                       I was the one told him to keep\n                       goin'!\n          \n          Then Louis grabs the pot for himself as Bobby picks up the\n          phone, several feet away from the ruckus.

The poker table in the\n          background is a riot, a contrast to the sober message\n          Bobby's getting.

You\n                    fuckin' keep away from her.\n          \n          Bobby realizes that NO ONE WANTS HIM HERE. He looks\n          through the glass to SEE Burt, still speaking to the Mayor.\n          Bobby storms out of the room to:\n          \n                                                                   47.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT.

As he does, we HEAR\n          a SOFT CHIME. A WOMAN'S VOICE SOUNDS on the P.A.:\n          \n                                   WOMAN'S VOICE\n                    Good evening.

She looks devastated. The struggle stops. All fall\n          silent, out of respect. Bobby steps back. Sandra turns to\n          look at Bobby. To the Guards:\n          \n                                    SANDRA GRUSINSKY\n                    It's okay.\n          \n          Bobby walks toward the entrance.   Stops.    Sandra seems to\n          read his mind, speaks:\n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                  48.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                                      SANDRA GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       He's alone. Your father just left\n                       for the precinct.\n          \n          Bobby nods subtly, mouths a \"THANK YOU.\" The Guards step\n          aside. He walks to the doors. Pauses. ENTERS:\n          \n          INT. WARD\n          \n          Joseph's bed is in the back of the large space. His face\n          is blocked by hospital curtains. Bobby steps forward.\n          \n          Slowly, he walks to his brother's bed. He peels away the\n          CURTAIN. Looks at JOSEPH'S FACE. Joseph's visage is\n          completely RAVAGED on the left side, covered with bandages\n          that are soaked with blood. A TERRIBLE IMAGE. The emotion\n          surges within him; he's HEARTBROKEN.\n          \n          It is a surprisingly painful moment. We can TELL he didn't\n          expect this level of destruction. His mouth drops open\n          slightly. Joseph's eyes open just a bit but don't look at\n          Bobby. Bobby slowly lifts his fingers, touches Joe's arm\n          gently. His fingers move down to his brother's hand.\n          Joseph is unresponsive but conscious. All of a sudden:\n          \n                                      NURSE\n                       Sir...?\n          \n          Joseph's hand closes around Bobby's fingers. The\n          connection is huge. Bobby's eyes well up, and he rubs\n          them, almost ashamed of the emotion. It is a shocking\n          OUTPOURING of FEELING from him.\n          \n          He leans over haltingly, kisses his brother's forehead:\n          \n                                       NURSE (CONT'D)\n                       Sir, I'm sorry--I.C.U. visiting\n                       hours are over.\n          \n          He waits a beat. The Nurse gently pulls his shoulder. He\n          backs away, his eyes reddened. The camera MOVES INTO a\n          CLOSE SHOT on BOBBY as we GO TO:\n          \n          INT. TENEMENT - HALLWAY\n          \n          A loud, active hallway of a housing project. Graffiti on\n          the walls, trash on the floor, but FULL OF LIFE.\n          \n          Bobby emerges from the elevator, emotionally distraught.\n          He SEES, in one far corner of the hall, two young Latino\n          teens smoking CRACK.\n          \n          He goes to one of the apartment doors, KNOCKS.    Opening the\n          door is a LATE MIDDLE-AGED LATINO WOMAN.\n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   49.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Behind her, is ROSARIO. (The woman who answers the door is\n          clearly Rosario's mother.)\n          \n          INT. ROSARIO'S APARTMENT - FOYER\n          \n          Rosario's mother discreetly backs away from the door. He\n          and Rosario stare at each other for a moment. Bobby gropes\n          for words. His emotions bubble up inside of him; then,\n          barely audible, his voice cracking:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       ...Feels like it was my fault...\n          \n          He sinks down, holding her tight, his head at her stomach.\n          She gently strokes his hair, kissing the top of his head.\n          \n          She shakes her head to reassure him, whispering\n          \"no...no...\". In this moment, he needs her. In this\n          moment, he is like a twelve year-old boy...\n          \n                                                          DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          INT. CAFE CAPPUCCINO - BRIGHTON AVENUE - NIGHT\n          \n          Across from the El Caribe. It's like a scene out of Balm\n          in Gilead here--raucous clubgoers are eating burgers and\n          drinking coffee after their nights on the town. Bobby and\n          Rosario and Louis sit at one of the tables. Bobby kisses\n          Rosario on her forehead as she reaches into her purse. She\n          looks through a small ziplock bag with a vial of cocaine.\n          Louis, meanwhile, is unaware of Bobby's state of mind, and\n          is busy putting on a show--as usual:\n          \n                                       LOUIS FALSETTI\n                       Where'd you run off to, like a Jew?\n                       You got outta there, it became like\n                       a real zoo.

Accidentally kicks the\n          waitress, who's bringing the check.\n          \n                                      LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)\n                       Oh, `scuse me, sorry about that.\n          \n          Bobby picks up the check, hands Louis some cash.\n          \n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   50.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       Hercules, do me a favor--before you\n                       kill a waitress, go pay the check.\n          \n                                      LOUIS FALSETTI\n                       Arright.

Scoops up the tip from a nearby\n          table.\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       Don't tell Louis nothing about what\n                       happened.

He and ROSARIO see each\n          other. He turns, SEES Pavel, in back. Pavel waves to\n          Bobby, and Bobby starts walking to him.\n          \n          INT. BACK OF THE CLUB\n          \n          Bobby approaches a table, reserved for Pavel and the rest\n          of the gang.

No\n                       bullshit.\n          \n          Pavel thinks a moment, eyes his cohorts.       Back to Bobby:\n          \n                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY\n                       Be on the boardwalk in a hour...\n          \n          Bobby turns to leave.

She gives him\n          a fearful look...\n          \n          EXT. BOARDWALK - NIGHT\n          \n          The famous Brighton Beach boardwalk. Bobby stands in the\n          cold, waiting, holding his bag of money. Alone. Takes out\n          the LIGHTER, the LISTENING DEVICE. He fires it--it works.\n          Looks at his watch. In rummaging through his pockets for a\n          smoke, he finds a little slip of paper with a phone number\n          on it. He APPROACHES a nearby PHONE BOOTH. Bobby holds\n          the paper in his hand, dials the number. A voice answers:\n          \n                                        MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)\n                       Hello?\n          \n          INT. ST.

Bobby hangs up the phone.\n          Takes a deep breath. We HEAR:\n          \n                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                       Dude!    Hey, dude!\n          \n          EXT. BOARDWALK STREET\n          \n          Bobby approaches the car. Pavel is in the back seat,\n          calling to him with the window open.\n          \n                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY\n                       Get in!\n          \n          Bobby approaches the automobile. Pavel is in the back\n          seat, calling to him with the window open. Another\n          American sedan behind them. Bobby enters Pavel's.\n          \n          INT. LIVERY CAR\n          \n          Bobby takes the front passenger seat.      Pavel is behind him.\n          Someone we DON'T KNOW is driving.\n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                    67.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          Bobby is somewhat edgy, with Pavel behind him. The car\n          pulls away from the curb. Then: Pavel throws a small towel\n          over Bobby's head. POINTS A REVOLVER AT BOBBY'S TEMPLE.\n          Bobby is startled by the action, blinded. Trying to stay\n          calm...\n          \n                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY\n                       Put your hands out, where I could\n                       see `em.\n          \n                                        BOBBY GREEN\n                       You know me.\n          \n                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY\n                       Shut your fuckin' mouth and do it!\n          \n          Bobby obliges. The driver, looking anxiously in his rear\n          view mirror, makes a SHARP LEFT, and the car VEERS. Pavel\n          then PATS BOBBY DOWN, searching for a wire, anything\n          incriminating. To the driver:\n          \n                                      PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Turn at the light...\n          \n          The CAR makes A SHARP LEFT.      In Russian, subtitled:\n          \n                                        PAVEL LUBYARSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Go left.    Again.\n          \n          EXT. STREET\n          \n          The Livery Car makes another brutal SHARP LEFT, tires\n          screeching just slightly.\n          \n          INT. LIVERY CAR\n          \n          Pavel again:\n          \n                                       PAVEL LUBYARSKY'S VOICE\n                       Let's go.   No one's on us.\n          \n          The camera MOVES INTO a SHOT OF THE HOODED BOBBY...\n          \n          EXT. STREET\n          \n          The Livery Car pulls up to the curb. We are on: a strange\n          residential street with tenements and graffiti everywhere.\n          Dark, deserted. Many silhouetted figures stand in doorways\n          up and down the block. They are all armed, with shotguns\n          and machine guns slung over their shoulders. A GARBAGE CAN\n          IS ON FIRE a few yards away. The men get out of the car.\n          They pull Bobby out:\n          \n                                                                68.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY\n          \n          They walk up the stairs, PULLING Bobby up over the steps.\n          He stumbles. They pick him up, lead him to a door.\n          \n          INT. TENEMENT - APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM\n          \n          Someone pulls the hood off him. Bobby looks around. The\n          room is ABSOLUTELY BARE. The driver puts Bobby's bag of\n          money down on the floor. A TEENAGED BOY wearing a SURGICAL\n          MASK comes and puts one on Bobby's face as well. Bobby\n          surveys the place. Where the hell is he? With that mask\n          on his face, we HEAR his BREATHING, loud and present,\n          through the sequence.\n          \n          It could be night or day, we wouldn't know. The windows\n          are blocked with duct tape to obscure all light. There is\n          VISQUINE hanging from seemingly everywhere. Parts of rooms\n          are cordoned off with the material. SILHOUETTED FIGURES\n          ROAM through the space like apparitions. A SLAVIC-LOOKING\n          MAN takes Bobby's bag of money, leaves the room.\n          \n          IN THE HALLWAY\n          \n          Stands Pavel, masked as well, armed now with a Kalashnikov\n          rifle. Without a word, he motions with a move of his head\n          to Bobby. \"FOLLOW ME,\" he seems to be saying.\n          \n          INT. BEDROOM\n          \n          Bobby enters the room, right behind Pavel. He SEES: a\n          dresser with a clock on it and a small mirror. Tables set\n          up in the middle of the room with brown jars on them.\n          There is a television on in the corner, a Russian ethnic\n          musical program silently unfolding.\n          \n          There are other people in the room: a BROWN-HAIRED MAN; and\n          two dark-haired SLAVIC-LOOKING WOMEN. It's an assembly\n          line for the preparation of narcotics.\n          \n          The SLAVIC MAN takes out the STACKS OF BILLS. Starts\n          counting them methodically. Pavel motions to the Brown-\n          Haired Man, puts up two fingers.\n          \n          On cue, the Brown-Haired Man rubs his hands together, then\n          takes two large JARS from his desk. Beneath the desk,\n          Bobby spots what looks like an ENORMOUS NUMBER of packages\n          of NARCOTICS, stacked against the wall.\n          \n          This is clearly THEIR STASH HOUSE. The Brown-Haired Man\n          pours powdery contents from a jar out onto his desk\n          blotter. He sits down, takes off his jacket, REVEALING:\n          TATTOOS, UP AND DOWN BOTH OF HIS ARMS.\n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                    69.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          The designs combine several images--skulls, snakes, and the\n          SPIDER WEB element that marked Vadim's own tattoo.\n          \n          He takes a RUSTY LETTER OPENER--it had been sitting atop\n          the desk--and pierces a GREEN PACKAGE. White powder seeps\n          from the package.\n          \n          Bobby watches from behind the mask as the man pushes and\n          pulls what looks like pure cocaine in powder form. He uses\n          two PLAYING CARDS to move the drug. Bobby eyes that RUSTY\n          LETTER OPENER...\n          \n          The Brown-Haired Man dips a measuring spoon in another\n          powder to add to the mix. He is cutting the drug. He\n          continues to manipulate the substance, and his hands move\n          with a kind of grace that one expects from a seasoned chef\n          on a cooking show.\n          \n          CLOSE SHOT on some lines of COCAINE. Pavel takes a toot.\n          He OFFERS it to Bobby as a taste. Bobby accepts. He pulls\n          down his mask momentarily, RUBBING a RATHER LARGE QUANTITY\n          OF THE DRUG ON HIS GUMS, HIS LIP. We HEAR:\n          \n                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI'S VOICE\n                       You needed to come here tonight...?\n          \n          Bobby looks over to see: EMERGING FROM THE BLACK, FROM DOWN\n          A DARKENED HALLWAY: VADIM NEZHINSKI. Everyone is wearing a\n          surgical mask--except, of course, for him. Bobby eyes him\n          with eyes that seem to become more BLOODSHOT by the second.\n          \n                                       VADIM NEZHINSKI\n                       What's the matter, ain't Pavel good\n                       enough for you?\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       That's all the money I got.    And I\n                       ain't gonna leave it alone.\n          \n          The Slavic Youth finishes counting Bobby's cash:\n          \n                                         SLAVIC YOUTH\n                       It's all there.

His face doesn't look bad, but one eye is a\n          different color from the other, and he's had reconstructive\n          surgery on his jaw.

LIVING ROOM\n          \n          The unaware crowd is having a great time. Children run\n          around the rooms. Bobby SEES GUARD #2, approaches. Burt\n          comes up next to him, takes him into a corner:\n          \n                                       BURT GRUSINSKY\n                       BOBBY--\n                              (SOTTO)\n                       What was said in there, he--he\n                       didn't mean it.\n          \n          Bobby contemplates this; we SEE that he tacitly accepts his\n          father's words.

Gently tries to stop him:\n          \n                                      BURT GRUSINSKY\n                       Wait--Don't go yet--\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN\n                              (to the Guard)\n                       Take me back to the motel.\n          \n          With that, Bobby leaves with his bodyguard. Burt stands\n          there for a moment, frustrated. TEDDY, his grandson, runs\n          past him. Naked. Sandra follows the boy. Burt turns to\n          see the naked youngster, then to Sandra:\n          \n                                      BURT GRUSINSKY\n                       Can't you put some clothes on him?\n          \n                                                                 84.\n          \n          \n          \n          EXT.

They're followed by Bobby.\n          \n          INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY\n          \n          Bobby approaches his room. A Guard, we'll call him VITT,\n          is outside the room holding his shotgun. Nods a \"hello\".\n          Bobby moves past him, opens the door.

MUSIC: GRANDMASTER FLASH'S \"WHITE LINES\".\n          ROSARIO DIAZ is in the center of the crowded floor, dancing\n          up a storm. She is having a GREAT TIME, surrounded by many\n          would-be male suitors and Louis. She is laughing and\n          stoned, and her gyrations are wonderfully erotic and free.\n          As she moves, she pushes the men away with a smile. All,\n          of course, except for Louis. Louis dances a CAN CAN with\n          two amused girls. Though fat, he's surprisingly graceful.\n          \n          ALL OF A SUDDEN: COMING THROUGH THE CROWD: BOBBY. When\n          Louis sees his friend, he lights up.

MOTEL FRONT - RAINY DAY\n          \n          Our characters are leaving the hotel, bags and all. The\n          RAIN comes down in SHEETS. They pause under the awning,\n          waiting for the cars to be brought close. Burt stands\n          under the awning, looking out at houses beyond the parking\n          lot. Rosario is rummaging through her suitcase as Bobby\n          stands nearby. Vitt approaches Burt:\n          \n                                      VITT THE GUARD\n                       Chief, we got three vehicles coming\n                       around the corner.

When Burt stares\n          at her, she averts his gaze. Burt changes course:\n          \n                                      BURT GRUSINSKY (CONT'D)\n                       Look, I'm just trying to keep us\n                       together here, that's all.

A beat, then the CARS PULL UP.\n          Bobby looks at his father with real feeling. Burt eyes\n          him, then touches Bobby's cheek, a truly loving gesture:\n          \n                                       BURT GRUSINSKY\n                              (almost to himself)\n                       Okay...\n                              (to an officer)\n                       We'll move `em to Corona.

MOTEL PARKING LOT\n          \n          THREE CARS: Burt in one, heading the route. Behind him is\n          Bobby and Rosario's car, with guard Vitt behind the wheel\n          and the two of them in the back seat. A third car has TWO\n          OFFICERS in it. That vehicle trails the other two. The\n          CARS DRIVE OFF.\n          \n          NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS TO BE SHOT IN A MOSTLY\n          SUBJECTIVE WAY, WITH THE EMPHASIS ON WITNESSING THE ACTION\n          AS OUR CHARACTERS WOULD.\n          \n                                                                93.\n          \n          \n          \n          INT. BOBBY'S CAR\n          \n          Bobby and Rosario are in the back seat. She looks through\n          her pocketbook for some gum, he remains focused on the view\n          through the windshield of his father's car.\n          \n          Bobby's driver, Vitt, follows Burt down the streets. RAIN\n          is FALLING frighteningly HARD, to the point where the\n          windshield wipers aren't moving fast enough for the water\n          on the windshield. Upsetting. Visibility's terrible.\n          \n          The cars swing onto the Kosciusko Bridge loop. The traffic\n          is sparse this early morning. We HEAR the THUMPETY-THUMP\n          of the bridge beams and the windshield wipers. And we HEAR\n          the steady, haunting HUM of the bridge surface beneath the\n          wheels of the automobiles. Bobby puts his arm around\n          Rosario, in the back seat. Re the rain:\n          \n                                    BOBBY GREEN\n                     It's really coming down...\n          \n                                    ROSARIO DIAZ\n                     Bobby--I think I left my watch at\n                     the hotel--\n          \n          Bobby does not answer, instead spots an OLDSMOBILE driving\n          alongside his vehicle. Seems a bit suspicious, the way\n          it's moving...\n          \n                                    BOBBY GREEN\n                     Hey--Vitt--I think somethin's on\n                     our right!\n          \n                                       VITT THE GUARD\n                              (TURNING)\n                     Huh--?\n          \n          A FLASH!\n          \n          CRACK! A BULLET punctures the windshield, but we don't\n          HEAR the SHOT. The hole SEEMS TO APPEAR almost out of\n          nowhere. The windshield cracks down the middle...\n          VITT IS HIT in the SHOULDER, and he lets out a piercing\n          cry. Blood hits the seat. Rosario screams. Bobby pushes\n          her head down, into the back seat.\n          \n          THE CAR starts to swerve. Bobby climbs awkwardly over to\n          the front seat. Takes the WHEEL, forcefully pulling Vitt\n          to the side. To Rosario:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                     Get down!\n          \n                                                         (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                      94.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n          Rosario crouches, covers the back of her head with her\n          hands. THE WATER gets pushed away by the speedy wipers\n          REVEALING: BURT'S CAR AND THE OLDSMOBILE HITTING EACH\n          OTHER, SIDE TO SIDE; THEN, A HUBCAP--we don't know from\n          which car it's been dislodged...\n          \n          COMES SPINNING AT INCREDIBLE SPEED. AT BOBBY'S WINDSHIELD.\n          Right at BOBBY, RIGHT AT US. WE BLINK. Bobby swerves.\n          THE HUBCAP SKIDS OFF the front windshield. Bobby brushes\n          up against the guardrail. We SEE THAT IT is all that\n          protects him from spinning off into the river, two hundred\n          feet below.\n          \n          Bobby darts from lane to lane, and the THIRD POLICE CAR--\n          behind the Olds--has SLAMMED on its BRAKES to avoid hitting\n          Bobby's car...\n          \n          THE OLDS IS RIGHT NEXT TO BURT'S CAR.      BOBBY SEES the\n          barrel of the gun swing to Burt.\n          \n          ANOTHER BIG PUDDLE--A MUFFLED THUNDERCLAP sound... The\n          water slides away, REVEALING that the back window of Burt's\n          car has shattered.\n          \n          Bobby is startled at this, his mouth momentarily drooping\n          open. He CAN SEE:\n          \n          HIS FATHER, FIRING his WEAPON out the window at the OLDS.\n          We HEAR BURT through the RADIO, a STATIC-RAVAGED SIGNAL:\n          \n                                      BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)\n                       They got a hit on! Get support,\n                       now!\n          \n          Bobby pulls up alongside the Olds. Looks inside. He tries\n          to get a good look but cannot. He SEES TWO people in the\n          car, one driving and one doing the shooting--\n          \n          BOOM!   And it punctures a hole in the side of Bobby's rear\n          door.   Rosario is JOLTED--screams again...\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN\n                       Rosario!   You hurt?\n          \n          She shakes her head, her face still buried in the vinyl.\n          She's hysterical--but physically unharmed.\n          \n          The traffic gets denser now. The WEATHER is terrible,\n          blinding. Rushes of WATER COVER the glass around the car,\n          wrecking visibility. We ARE ON: the B.Q.E., with many\n          trucks, big and small, on it.\n          \n          \n          \n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   95.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          \n          The Olds weaves in and out, in front of and behind, many\n          large semis. BOBBY WATCHES AS: Burt's car is right behind\n          the Olds. This is unbelievably dangerous.\n          \n          A TRUCK starts changing lanes. The Olds scoots past it\n          before it does, but: Burt does not. THE TRUCK CLIPS Burt's\n          car on the driver's side. He sneaks through, recovering\n          and keeping up the pursuit.\n          \n          POLICE CARS, SIRENS BLAZING, JOIN THE PURSUIT...\n          \n          The truck starts to skid on the drenched roadway. Then: IT\n          JACKNIFES, spinning out. The Police Car behind Bobby's\n          slams into the truck, making a MACABRE CRUNCHING SOUND.\n          \n          BOBBY'S EYES, as he turns around and witnesses the horrific\n          accident through the RAIN-SOAKED rear window. It is\n          TERRIBLE:\n          \n          The truck CRUSHES the Police car, its carriage flipping\n          over and flattening the vehicle and probably the people\n          inside.\n          \n          The Olds skids ferociously, pulling off the expressway\n          toward city streets. Burt's car follows. Burt's car and\n          the Olds are neck-and-neck. Bobby pulls up beside Burt.\n          Into the radio:\n          \n                                     BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)\n                    Pop, lay back!\n          \n          But Burt does not. Burt has a clear shot at the hooded man\n          in the back seat. HE FIRES.\n          \n          A HIT! We can see the BLOOD spatter the perp's automobile.\n          The man's head jerks back spasmodically. We HEAR:\n          \n                                    BURT'S VOICE (RADIO FILTER)\n                    I got him!   I got the sonofabitch!\n          \n          AND THEN, CLOSE SHOT ON BOBBY: THREE QUICK CUTS, CLOSER AND\n          CLOSER...SILENCE... He sees, through the rain: a LONG\n          SHOTGUN BARREL come out of the window from the rear\n          passenger's seat area.\n          \n          His eyes pop. The OLDS SPEEDS UP.    THE BARREL OF THE\n          SHOTGUN turns:\n          \n          WATER covers the windshield, BLINDING the driver (and us).\n          The water slides off the glass.\n          \n          THEN: A TERRIBLE THUNDERCLAP.\n          \n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                    96.\n          CONTINUED: (3)\n          \n          \n          BOBBY WATCHES as BLOOD COVERS BURT'S FACE. He's been HIT.\n          He loses control of the automobile... Bobby freezes, IN\n          DISBELIEF. IN HORROR. HIS FATHER HAS BEEN SHOT...\n          \n          EXT. STREET\n          \n          Through the RAIN, we SEE: a patch of parochial school\n          children, ASIAN CHILDREN, on the streetcorner.\n          \n          Bobby's car peels off, away from danger. Burt's car IS\n          HEADED RIGHT FOR THEM. In what seems like his dazed last\n          gasp, he SLAMS on the BRAKES. The car skids out, spins.\n          The motion is DIZZYING...\n          \n          THE OLDS is uncontrolled. The vehicle moves through a\n          traffic light, HITTING another car.\n          \n          STARTS TUMBLING, NOT ON ITS SIDE, BUT HEAD OVER TAIL.\n          \n          It is one intense image. The car is upside down now. It\n          slides for tens of feet before stopping. Smoldering...\n          \n          The rain falls, making an oddly serene sound.   We HEAR\n          SIRENS. The Police are approaching.\n          \n          Burt's car stops slowly. He gets out of the car, his face\n          a mess. He stumbles for a few feet in the rain. BOBBY'S\n          CAR ARRIVES on the SCENE...\n          \n          BURT'S EYES ARE RED, filling with blood. His JAW is open.\n          He gasps for air, a vacant stare on his face. His body\n          spasms. Then he collapses, on his knees. FALLS. FACE\n          DOWN. IN A POOL OF BLOOD. The Police are in the\n          background...\n          \n          WIDE SHOT of the BLOCK as BOBBY MOVES TO HIS FATHER, WHO IS\n          LYING ON THE STREET. Bobby bends down, turning his father\n          over. His father's blood is all over his hands now.\n          \n          Burt is dead.\n          \n          Other cops surround them. Bobby looks up at all of them,\n          they at him. Broken, he pushes the others away. As water\n          drips off his face:\n          \n                                   BOBBY GREEN\n                    Don't fuckin' look at him! I said\n                    don't--back up!

The CAMERA TILTS DOWN. The BLOOD from BURT'S\n          BODY flows into the street, along the curb,into the gutter.\n          \n                                                             DISSOLVE TO:\n          \n          INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT\n          \n          Bobby and Rosario, outside an office. Armed cops are up\n          and down the hall. We HEAR conversation through the walls.\n          Bobby is standing, smoking a cigarette, holding back tears.\n          Rosario is seated on a nearby bench--wet, shivering,\n          stunned. Rosario looks to Bobby:\n          \n                                       ROSARIO DIAZ\n                       Bobby?   Could I call my mother...?\n          \n          Speechless, Bobby nods.

We HEAR the crowd in\n          the house, but they are in the living room. A KNOCK: Bobby\n          enters.\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                    Joseph?\n          \n          Joseph eyes him, seems heartened by the sight of his\n          brother.

FUNERAL HOME - DAY\n          \n          The shot is of a small and bare room in a Queens funeral\n          home. In the center is a COFFIN. The camera DOLLIES\n          TOWARD IT.

Inside is Burt, eyes\n          closed, clothed in a suit. We don't see the body; what we\n          DO see are the reactions of his two sons. Bobby's grief is\n          obvious, but he's already seen him dead. This is new\n          territory for Joseph, who though he does not break down,\n          seems overwhelmed. Both young men nod in acknowledgement,\n          and the Undertaker closes the coffin.\n          \n                                      UNDERTAKER (CONT'D)\n                       Now I'm told you're going to be\n                       handling the arrangements for\n                       tomorrow's service--?\n          \n                                       JOSEPH GRUSINSKY\n                              (DEVASTATED)\n                       That's right...\n          \n                                       UNDERTAKER\n                       Could you come with me please?\n                              (to Bobby)\n                       We'll be right back.\n          \n          As the Undertaker leads Joseph away, Bobby enters an:\n          \n          INT.

Many of them we recognize\n          from elsewhere in the film but don't know by name. One of\n          the people to emerge from a Town Car is MARAT BUZHAYEV and\n          his ever-present BABUSHKA WIFE, KALINA.\n          \n          The walk begins, with everyone saluting Bobby and Joseph.\n          \n          Behind them, the Mayor, the Commissioner, all the rank and\n          file of the Force.

She is with the women.\n          \n          Bobby peers at the procession, which is made up of hundreds\n          of SALUTING COPS, others.

Bobby is greatly moved by his appearance, and\n          nods subtly to Jumbo. Louis salutes gently, a slight and\n          sympathetic smile coming across his face...\n          \n          SIMULTANEOUS: Joseph takes a look at the COFFIN, grows more\n          distraught.

Bobby wheels around, to a GUARD.\n          INTENSE EXPRESSION.\n          \n                                   BOBBY GREEN\n                    What happened--where'd she go?!?\n          \n                                   GUARD\n                    She left about an hour ago.   She\n                    said to give you this--\n          \n          The GUARD hands Bobby a NOTE.   BOBBY SEES IT, GRABS IT\n          WITHOUT READING IT.\n          \n                                   BOBBY GREEN\n                    We gotta go find her!\n          \n                                   GUARD\n                    She asked us not to, Bobby. She's--\n                    Bobby--we can't do that legally!\n          \n          Bobby tries to charge past them. The Guards all restrain\n          him delicately (\"C'mon, calm down\"), but Bobby is in no\n          mood and instead starts a melee. He is a tour de force of\n          energy, and it takes no less than everyone here to subdue\n          him. The FIGHT is more a WRESTLING MATCH than anything\n          else, and it is messy, tough:\n          \n                                   BOBBY GREEN\n                    DON'T--FUCKIN'--\n          \n          Bobby's forehead is cut; the struggle is UGLY. The Guards\n          rouse up enough strength to PUSH HIM into the HOTEL ROOM\n          for GOOD. THE DOOR SLAMS. A SILENT BEAT. Bobby paces, in\n          a rage. Then, sarcastic:\n          \n                                    BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)\n                    Go `head!   Keep me in here--KEEP ME\n                    HERE!\n          \n          \n          \n          \n                                                           (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                      113.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n                                      GUARD'S VOICE (MUFFLED)\n                       Bobby, we don't wanna have to put\n                       you in restraints, so just calm\n                       down!\n                              (BEAT)\n                       Calm the fuck down!\n          \n          Bobby stares at the door.\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       You gonna keep me here? HUH?!?\n          \n          Still in a fury, he takes a lamp and HITS THE DOOR\n          REPEATEDLY. Then he HURLS the lamp toward a mirror on the\n          wall, AND IT SHATTERS... Exhausted, he stops. Moves to:\n          \n          INT. BEDROOM\n          \n          Where he sits on the edge of the bed, touches his neck.\n          BLOOD on his hand. He STILL GRIPS THE UNREAD NOTE. He\n          throws it to the ground; and then, perhaps motivated by the\n          realization of his situation, a flood of feeling comes over\n          him. Tears begin to fall down his face, and he succumbs.\n          \n          It is as though all of the emotions in our story find their\n          outlet here, in this moment. Bobby lets all the remaining\n          feeling drain from him until he has nothing left.\n          \n          After this outburst, he is exhausted. He calms, breathing\n          heavily. A beat; he puts his bloodied hand to his head...\n          \n          We PRELAP the SOUND of a PHONE RINGING:\n          \n          INT. QUEENS BAR - PHONE BOOTH\n          \n          A noisy Queens place, its blue collar patrons watching\n          boxing on the television and cheering. PAN OVER TO: one of\n          those old, in-the-wall phone booths, with a sliding door.\n          Bobby is on the phone, seated in the dark space. Holds a\n          GLASS half-full of LIQUOR. Distraught, he listens for an\n          answer as the PHONE RINGS once more. Then:\n          \n                                       A MAN'S VOICE (PHONE FILTER)\n                       Hello?\n          \n          A BEAT.   Bobby collects himself.    Then:\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN\n                       It's me, Lou.\n          \n                                       LOUIS FALSETTI (PHONE FILTER)\n                       HEY!!!!

I\n                       know you'll enjoy it.\n          \n          APPLAUSE.

THE SPOTLIGHT swings to Bobby, who stands\n          briefly, sheepishly. Marat waves to him, Bobby nods, sits.\n          The SPOTLIGHT swings back to Marat who finishes up his\n          introduction (\"Enjoy the show!\n          \n                                                            (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                   116.\n          CONTINUED: (2)\n          \n          Thank you.\") and exits to still more applause. ELI\n          MIRICHENKO, Marat's son-in-law, approaches Bobby. In his\n          EAR:\n          \n                                   ELI MIRICHENKO\n                    My father-in-law would love it if\n                    you come upstairs later, to say\n                    hello.\n          \n                                    BOBBY GREEN\n                    Okay, Eli.

I have no\n                    doubt she'll be back.\n          \n          Louis turns to watch the show for a beat, takes a huge swig\n          of his DRINK. Then turns AROUND AGAIN; close to Bobby:\n          \n                                    LOUIS FALSETTI (CONT'D)\n                    I mean, between you and me, that\n                    place they had you in was drivin'\n                    her crazy.

We got the old man!\n          \n          Bobby looks at Michael, points to his earpiece. Michael\n          nods, and as we HEAR Mike's words into his radio (\"Our\n          guys, outta the brush!\") Bobby starts to back up, toward\n          the clearing...\n          \n          EXT. CLEARING\n          \n          Bobby is greeted by the boys. Other POLICE, including\n          Michael Solo, emerge from the weeds, quietly. Jack\n          APPROACHES:\n          \n                                      JACK SHAPIRO\n                       We got the old man--Buzhayev. Up\n                       by the cars. His grandkids are\n                       safe--they're in the van.\n          \n          Bobby acknowledges this, turns to another OFFICER:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       Are all our guys out?\n          \n          The Officer looks, counts.     Then nods.   Bobby looks toward\n          the weeds and says:\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)\n                       Burn it.\n          \n          SEVERAL COPS BREAK FLARES, ROLLING THEM INTO THE WEEDS.\n          \n          \n                                                              (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                  128.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          \n          All the officers back up--all of them except Bobby. Who\n          stands, shotgun in hand, waiting for VADIM NEZHINSKI to\n          emerge from the now-burning brush.\n          \n          TWO OTHER MEN come out of the fire, coughing. They are\n          carrying their guns and thus killed by POLICE GUNFIRE. NO\n          SIGHT OF NEZHINSKI AS BOBBY WAITS. AT LAST, HE DECIDES TO\n          GO IN.\n          \n                                       MICHAEL SOLO\n                       Bobby?   What're you doin'--\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN\n                       I'm not gonna let him get away...\n          \n          AS the other POLICE panic around him, Bobby ENTERS THE\n          FIRE...\n          \n          INT. FIERY WEEDS\n          \n          Bobby walks through the FLAME. It is OTHERWORLDLY. The\n          ORANGE-BLUE, the SMOKE, it all seems to blow from left to\n          right...\n          \n          CHAOS of HEAT, SMOKE... We HEAR ONLY THE RUSHING WIND...\n          BOBBY seems INCONCEIVABLY DRIVEN. Methodically stepping\n          forward, past the FIRES, PEERING THROUGH SMOKE. NOTHING...\n          JUST TUFTS OF SMOKE...\n          \n          Then he spots an area in which the SMOKE FLOWS UNNATURALLY,\n          AGAINST THE BREEZE, as though it SURGES AROUND SOMETHING...\n          SOMETHING COVERED IN SMOKE, STANDING...\n          \n          A GUST OF WIND PASSES--REVEALING--A SILHOUETTED FIGURE,\n          WITH HIS ARM RAISED, POINTING, RIGHT AT BOBBY.\n          \n          VADIM NEZHINSKI, POISED TO SHOOT.\n          \n          Within what seems like a split second, Bobby raises his\n          SHOTGUN and FIRES it. VADIM CRUMPLES TO THE GROUND. A\n          DIRECT HIT to the chest.\n          \n          Bobby lifts his shotgun and approaches. The weeds\n          separate, REVEALING NEZHINSKI, with a look on his face that\n          registers a kind of shock, a shock that he's been hit.\n          Nezhinski sees Bobby standing over him. With all the\n          energy he has in the world:\n          \n                                      VADIM NEZHINSKI\n                       Don't...don't let me die in here...\n          \n          Bobby stands over him for a BEAT. Then Bobby turns his\n          back on Vadim, walks through the fires around him. As\n          Vadim calls after him (\"BOBBY!\n                                                             (CONTINUED)\n          \n                                                                  129.\n          CONTINUED:\n          \n          PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE!\"), the flames begin to engulf\n          the area where Nezhinski lies...\n          \n          EXT. FIELD\n          \n          BOBBY EMERGES FROM THE FIRE...     HE WALKS TOWARD THE POLICE\n          CARS. THE POLICE ARE ASSEMBLED     around: MARAT BUZHAYEV.\n          BOBBY WATCHES HIM FOR A MOMENT,    HIS FACE filled with\n          CONTROLLED RAGE. BEAT. EACH MAN    STARES AT EACH OTHER.

Bobby's expression\n          seems unmatched in its ferocity; Marat sees in Bobby's eyes\n          a horrible determination, begins to cry... Bobby's\n          emotions are a CAULDRON:\n          \n                                       BOBBY GREEN\n                       Get down!   On the ground!\n          \n          Marat gets on his knees. WHIMPERING. Bobby puts Marat's\n          hands on his head, starts PATTING HIM DOWN. CLEAN.\n          \n          BOBBY PUTS THE SHOTGUN AT MARAT'S TEMPLE.    We HEAR the\n          DOGS, the FIRE, the WIND, the SIRENS...\n          \n          The police see the unforgiving expression on Bobby's face\n          and the reality of the old man in front of them. Bobby\n          turns to the others, particularly JACK. He looks at him,\n          dark-eyed. Then he turns away and starts walking, making\n          eye contact with none of them. He utters a command, to all\n          of them and none of them in particular:\n          \n                                      BOBBY GREEN (CONT'D)\n                       Put him in the fuckin' van...\n                       Don't touch him...\n          \n          Bobby walks past the small building, which CONTINUES TO\n          BURN SILENTLY--with that eerie BLUE FLAME... Other cops\n          watch him with awe and respect. They back away from him.\n          He proceeds on toward the cars.\n          \n          HE SEES: Joseph inside one of them, still. Staring at him.\n          WE DOLLY WITH HIM as he moves to his brother. CROUCHES\n          DOWN, stays by JOSEPH...\n          \n          CLOSE SHOT OF AN ANNOUNCEMENT BOARD, SURROUNDED BY FLOWERS:\n          \n          \"ONE P.M.: N.Y.P.D.

Milling about in a white\n          plaster walled room. Upbeat chatter. Then: Bobby emerges\n          through the DOORS in his DRESS BLUES. Upon seeing him, the\n          others smile, CHEER.

HE SEES ROSARIO,\n          standing in the crowd behind the seated audience. Her face\n          is partially obscured. BOBBY CANNOT BELIEVE THE FLOOD OF\n          EMOTION that overwhelms him, the happiness he feels upon\n          catching a glimpse of her.\n          \n          But just as quickly as this thrill grabs him, it disappears\n          when she becomes completely visible; for he realizes that\n          IT IS NOT HER but rather a young woman who bears merely a\n          faint resemblance... Joseph interrupts this, leans over:\n          \n                                   JOSEPH GRUSINSKY\n                    I love you, Bobby.\n          \n                                    BOBBY GREEN\n                           (back to reality)\n                    Love you too, Joe.\n          \n          Police line up on the stage.
