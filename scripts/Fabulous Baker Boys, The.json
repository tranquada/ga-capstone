STREET - JACK\n</b>\n\tJack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing\n\ta tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with\n\tthe milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an\n\tall-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before\n\the hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he\n\tgoes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  \n\tSlipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at\n\tthe glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n</b>\t\tHey, Jackie!\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tHow goes it, Tommy?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tTOMMY (DOORMAN)\n</b>\t\t\t(shrugging)\n\t\tAh, you know.

Come on, we're on.\n\n\tFrank just stands there, bottled up with\n\texasperation.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCareful, Frank.  When you get angry your\n\t\ttie starts to spin.\n\n\n\tJack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his\n\thead, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard\n\tstand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies\n\tof Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,\n\tthis: \"Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the\n\tFabulous Baker Boys!\"\n\n<b>\tBAKER BROTHERS\n</b>\n\tas they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge\n\tand settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent\n\tthat what the \"Fabulous Baker Boys\" are, in fact, is a\n\tpoor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.\n\n<b>\tWIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE\n</b>\n\tAs they begin to plink out their \"theme song\" tables\n\tof middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana\n\tdaiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.\n\tAfter a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and\n\tthe couples applaud.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(Mr.  Smile)\n\t\tThank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome\n\t\tto the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker\n\t\tand eighty-eight keys across from me is my\n\t\tlittle brother, Jack.\n\n\tApplause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes\n\ta draw on his cigarette.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing; could do this in his sleep)\n\t\tYou know, my brother and I have been playing\n\t\ttogether, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it\n\t\tbeen, Jack?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tTwenty-eight years, Frank.\n\n\tApplause.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tThat's a lot of water under the\n\t\tbridge, eh, Jack?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tLotta water.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tOf course, back then, things were a little\n\t\tdifferent.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just\n\t\tabout the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie\n\t\tLies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would\n\t\tlisten to us was the family cat, Cecil.\n\t\t\t(to Jack)\n\t\tWe must have shaved three lives off that cat,\n\t\teh, Jack?\n\n\tLaughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of\n\trazor blades.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBut seriously.  It's been fifteen years since\n\t\tJack and I first stepped on the stage as\n\t\tprofessionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,\n\t\tand more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...\n\t\twell, believe me, we've seen our share of this\n\t\tcrazy country of ours.  But even though we've\n\t\tplayed some of the finest venues in the world ...\n\n\tAt this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... There's one place that's always been, for us,\n\t\ta very special place, and that place is... this\n\t\tplace, the Starfire lounge.\n\n\tJack lays in a few soft bass chords.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhy?  Well, I guess you could just say it's\n\t\tthe ...\n\t\t\t(pregnant moment)\n\t\t... people.\n\n\tAt which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard\n\tand give birth to the melody of -- what else?  \"People.'\n\n\n<b>\tJACK AND FRANK - LATER\n</b>\tThey exit the stage to applause.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tThank you.  Remember, room service is available\n\ttill one A.M. for you late-nighters.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.  HOTEL KITCHEN\n</b>\n\tJack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tDon't make trouble, all right?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tWho's gonna make trouble?\n\t\t\t(spotting someone)\n\t\tHey, amigo!\n\n\n<b>\tJACK'S POV - MAN\n</b>\n\tin an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,\n\tlooks up.\n\n<b>\tBACK TO SCENE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tMAN\n</b>\t\tJack!\n\t\t\t(lower)\n\t\tFrank.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(the feeling's mutual)\n\t\tYeah, hi, Hector.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tHECTOR (MAN)\n</b>\t\t\t(re: the soup bone)\n\t\tFor Eddie.

OFFICE\n</b>\n\tFrank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,\n\tdespite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal\n\tattitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays\n\tin the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture\n\tany further is to risk contracting some hideous\n\tdisease.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tLLOYD (YOUNG MAN)\n</b>\t\t\t(preparing a cash envelope)\n\t\tTerrific, boys.

If you\n\t\twanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go\n\t\tplay with the niggers on State Street.

He is utterly still,\n\tlike a pit bull eyeing a steak.\n\n<b>\tBACK TO SCENE\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n</b>\t\tOkay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more\n\tlessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.\n\n\tLloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,\n\tbusiness closed, busies himself with other matters.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tUh ...

He just looks at Jack, smiling\n\twith amusement.\n\n\n<b>\tEXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK\n</b>\n\tJack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped\n\tsoup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard\n\tstand-up under his arm.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tYou mind telling me what that was about in there?\n\t\tWas that planned?  \n\t\tOr were you just bored and decided\n\t\tto get creative?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tFuck him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tThis isn't the Pine Tree Inn on\n\t\tRoute 81, Jack.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tFuck him.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tFuck him.

Frank opens the trunk and starts to put\n\tthe stand-up away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tSo we on tomorrow night?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tMaybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the\n\t\tSheraton's got appendicitis.\n\n\tJack nods and starts to walk away.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\tJack stops.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen ... why don't you come out to the house\n\t\tthis weekend.

No, Frank,\n\t\tI'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.\n\t\tGood night, Frank.\n\n\tFrank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.\n\tJack watches the taillights burn into the distance,\n\tthen takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads\n\tfor home.\n\n<b>\tANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING\n</b>\n\tJack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment\n\tbuilding, where a black labrador is studying him from\n\ta second story window.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT\n</b>\n\tJack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably\n\tcluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone\n\tbooth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,\n\tEDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not\n\tan overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his\n\tface that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tHi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the\n\t\tapartment.\n\n\tEddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper\n\tand hands it over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTake it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular\n\t\tJohhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth\n\t\taround here.\n\n\tJack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over\n\tto an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  \n\tHe lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the\n\tMACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky \"PEACE PIECE\" fills the\n\ttiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and\n\twalks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling\n\tback with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows\n\tgently on the keys and stares out the open window,\n\tlistening to the music.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.  PIANO STORE\n</b>\n\tJack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano\n\tshowroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.\n\tWILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap\n\tupright, contemplating his shoes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWhat happened to the two Clays, Willie?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n</b>\t\tOut.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWhen they coming in?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n</b>\t\tWednesday next.\n\t\tFrank looks across the room at Jack.\n\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWhat d'ya got?,\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tBosen black.\n\t\t\t(taps a key)\n\t\tFlat.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWhat d'you say, Willie?

The Regency downtown,\n\t\tThursday-Friday.  Thanks.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n</b>\t\tMy pleasure.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.  DINER\n</b>\n\tThe brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,\n\tJack nursing an ice coffee,\n\tFrank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  \n\tThe glass next to them is cluttered with photographs\n\tof neighborhood luminaries,\n\tincluding two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tYou know, I think it's been five years since I\n\t\tsaw you eat anything.

After a moment, their voices fade and Jack\n\tlooks back to the children on the screen,\n\tlike two tiny men, mirror images of one another.\n\tAt first the changes are subtle.  \n\tLittle Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.\n\tBut as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one\n\tanother less and less, until finally,\n\tthe little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in\n\this place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in\n\trumpled coat and open collar,\n\ta cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  \n\tA woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the\n\toffending cigarette away in a flash.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

First, married\n\t\tfor all of two days, please say hello to Helen\n\t\tand Bud Wilson.  Helen.

Why?\n\t\tBecause, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane\n\t\thave been married for seventy-five years!\n\n\tThe audience lets go with an audible \"ooh\"\n\tand applauds enthusiastically.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tEthel, Bert.

Finally, everyone\n\ton the dance floor steps back and, with some help from\n\ta few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the\n\tway, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center\n\tof the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger\n\tcouple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

They hesitate, then kiss lightly,\n\tpulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's\n\teyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of \"Auld Lang Syne\"\n\tand Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place\n\ton the stage.

He opens his eyes,\n\tsquinting against the light from the bathroom, then\n\tglances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline\n\tof a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the\n\tside, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.\n\tSuddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in\n\tthe next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast\n\tfrom the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack\n\tstares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the\n\tbathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and\n\tgently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming\n\tmurkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  \n\tHis back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is\n\tshaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees\n\tthat water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and\n\tgathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes\n\tup.

A huge tote board,\n\tset on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,\n\tat 2:15 AM, is $1125.38.

I got Ma's\n\t\tmedical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  \n\t\tJack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so\n\t\tfucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't\n\t\tyou think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes\n\t\tand blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  \n\t\tBut I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little\n\t\tbrother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out\n\t\tin my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go\n\t\ton living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,\n\t\tbut you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I\n\t\tfolded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,\n\t\tlittle brother.

JACK!\n\n\tFrank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  \n\tSuddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still\n\tclasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior\n\tas Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks\n\tat his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped\n\tand dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split\n\tand bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks\n\thollow, frightened.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tI'm through with it.

And we see:\n\n\n<b>\tSERIES OF SHOTS\n</b>\n\tJack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain\n\tover now.\n\n\tFrank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the\n\tdim glow of the streetlights.\n\n\tJack, letting himself into his apartment and standing\n\tthere.  Alone.\n\n\tFrank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off\n\tthe engine.\n\n\tJack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.\n\n\tFrank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as\n\tthe sun begins to come up.\n\n\tJack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

As she leaves, Jack studies the slip\n\tof paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  \n\tHe glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's\n\twake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.\n\n\n<b>\tINT.

After a moment, he crosses the\n\tstreet.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of\n\tthe tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,\n\tkneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --\n\tcat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the\n\tdamage smoothed and widened by time.

She kept them in tune.  \n\t\tCan you imagine?  \n\t\tNow why would she do something like that?\n\n\tFrank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  \n\tSuddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot\n\tglasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a\n\tdifferent hotel.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have\n\t\tthat drink after all.\n\t\t\t(picking up a few glasses)\n\t\tWhat's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  \n\t\tWe got the Travelodge on Route 41.  \n\t\tAnd ... the Mallory.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tI'll take the Mallory.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tGood choice.\n\n\tFrank blows some dust off the glasses.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLooks like these got a few years on them.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tThis'll kill 'em.\n\n\tJack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano\n\tbenches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tJesus.\n\n\tIt suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old\n\tfamiliar place, staring into his glass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tHow're your hands?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(surprised)\n\t\tOh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple\n\t\tsore knuckles.  Nothing.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tYou know, that night, I ... It\n\t\tjust all came up.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tYeah, I know.  Me, too.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tI mean, you can play.  You're\n\t\tokay.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tI can keep the beat.\n\n\tJack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCharlie called.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tYeah?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tYeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  \n\t\tDonna said even Lloyd called the other day.  \n\t\tNothing like a little absence to make the heart\n\t\tgrow fonder, huh?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tYeah.\n\n\tJack and Frank lock eyes again.  \n\tFrank's glance drops to Jack's glass.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tJesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tFive years ago.\n\t\t\t(thinking)\n\t\tNovember.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tRight.  It was someone's birthday.\n\t\tHalloran?\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tDaughter's.  Sweet sixteen.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tChrist, that's right.  How could\n\t\tI forget.  What a nightmare.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tShe asked for it.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tI told Halloran we didn't do\n\t\tvocals, but he said:\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK AND FRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(in unison)\n\t\tWhat my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tShe got it all right.\n\n\tJack and Frank glance at one another, little boy\n\tmischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel\n\ton the pianos and begin to play \"You're Sixteen.\"\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK AND FRANK\n</b>\t\t\t(singing)\n\t\tShe comes on like a dream\n\t\tPeaches and cream\n\t\tLips like strawberry wine\n\t\tShe's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.\n\t\tRibbons and curls\n\t\tOoh, what a girl\n\t\tEyes that sparkle and shine\n\t\tYou're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.\n\n\tAs Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a\n\tmoment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  \n\tFull of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before\n\thim, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is\n\tquiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tFRANK\n</b>\t\tWell ... One more time?\n\n\tJack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass\n\theld out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\tJACK\n</b>\t\tOne more time.\n\n\n\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Fabulous Baker Boys, The</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Steven Kloves\" title=\"Scripts by Steven Kloves\">Steven Kloves</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Romance\" title=\"Romance Scripts\">Romance</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Fabulous Baker Boys, The Script.html#comments\" title=\"Fabulous Baker Boys, The comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:03.137442"}
