STREET - JACK\n\n\tJack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing\n\ta tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with\n\tthe milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an\n\tall-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before\n\the hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he\n\tgoes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.  \n\tSlipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at\n\tthe glittering building as if sizing up an opponent.\n\n\t\t\t\tDOORMAN\n\t\tHey, Jackie!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHow goes it, Tommy?\n\n\t\t\t\tTOMMY (DOORMAN)\n\t\t\t(shrugging)\n\t\tAh, you know.

HOTEL - ANGLE ON FRANK\n\n\tJack's older brother, FRANK, is pacing outside the\n\tlounge when he sees Jack approaching.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tGreat.  Terrific.  Glad you could\n\t\tmake it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHow we doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHow we ... ? What, are you kidding\n\t\tme?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tAm I late?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThat's not the point.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(taking out a cigarette)\n\t\tWhat's the point?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou cannot continue to walk in at\n\t\tthe last moment, Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou want me to show up late a few\n\t\tnights?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFrank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFrank.  I'm here.  I always get\n\t\there.  Don't sweat it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tChrist, will you look at your hair?\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tJack turns to the wall, which is paneled in tiny\n\ttinted mirrors shot through with veins of gold.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat's wrong with it?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou look like you just crawled out\n\t\tof bed.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo one's gonna be looking at my\n\t\thair.  Come on, we're on.\n\n\tFrank just stands there, bottled up with\n\texasperation.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCareful, Frank.  When you get angry your\n\t\ttie starts to spin.\n\n\n\tJack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his\n\thead, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard\n\tstand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies\n\tof Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,\n\tthis: \"Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the\n\tFabulous Baker Boys!\"\n\n\tBAKER BROTHERS\n\n\tas they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge\n\tand settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent\n\tthat what the \"Fabulous Baker Boys\" are, in fact, is a\n\tpoor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.\n\n\tWIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE\n\n\tAs they begin to plink out their \"theme song\" tables\n\tof middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana\n\tdaiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.\n\tAfter a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and\n\tthe couples applaud.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(Mr.  Smile)\n\t\tThank you.  Thank you.  Good evening and welcome\n\t\tto the Starfire lounge.  My name is Frank Baker\n\t\tand eighty-eight keys across from me is my\n\t\tlittle brother, Jack.\n\n\tApplause.  Little brother Jack smiles, winks, and takes\n\ta draw on his cigarette.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing; could do this in his sleep)\n\t\tYou know, my brother and I have been playing\n\t\ttogether, gosh, I don't know.  How long has it\n\t\tbeen, Jack?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tTwenty-eight years, Frank.\n\n\tApplause.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThat's a lot of water under the\n\t\tbridge, eh, Jack?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tLotta water.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tOf course, back then, things were a little\n\t\tdifferent.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just\n\t\tabout the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie\n\t\tLies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would\n\t\tlisten to us was the family cat, Cecil.\n\t\t\t(to Jack)\n\t\tWe must have shaved three lives off that cat,\n\t\teh, Jack?\n\n\tLaughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of\n\trazor blades.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBut seriously.  It's been fifteen years since\n\t\tJack and I first stepped on the stage as\n\t\tprofessionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,\n\t\tand more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...\n\t\twell, believe me, we've seen our share of this\n\t\tcrazy country of ours.  But even though we've\n\t\tplayed some of the finest venues in the world ...\n\n\tAt this point, Jack begins to mimic his brother's words.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\t... There's one place that's always been, for us,\n\t\ta very special place, and that place is... this\n\t\tplace, the Starfire lounge.\n\n\tJack lays in a few soft bass chords.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhy?  Well, I guess you could just say it's\n\t\tthe ...\n\t\t\t(pregnant moment)\n\t\t... people.\n\n\tAt which point Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard\n\tand give birth to the melody of -- what else?  \"People.'\n\n\n\tJACK AND FRANK - LATER\n\tThey exit the stage to applause.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThank you.  Remember, room service is available\n\ttill one A.M. for you late-nighters.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL KITCHEN\n\n\tJack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tDon't make trouble, all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWho's gonna make trouble?\n\t\t\t(spotting someone)\n\t\tHey, amigo!\n\n\n\tJACK'S POV - MAN\n\n\tin an apron, cutting meat off a huge soup bone,\n\tlooks up.\n\n\tBACK TO SCENE\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tJack!\n\t\t\t(lower)\n\t\tFrank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(the feeling's mutual)\n\t\tYeah, hi, Hector.\n\n\t\t\t\tHECTOR (MAN)\n\t\t\t(re: the soup bone)\n\t\tFor Eddie.  I wrap.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tGracias.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(as they exit)\n\t\tI mean it, Jack.  Behave.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tLike an angel.\n\n\n\tINT.  OFFICE\n\n\tFrank stands across the desk from a YOUNG MAN who,\n\tdespite his youth, has an irritatingly paternal\n\tattitude toward the two men in his office.  Jack stays\n\tin the doorway, smoking a cigarette, as if to venture\n\tany further is to risk contracting some hideous\n\tdisease.\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD (YOUNG MAN)\n\t\t\t(preparing a cash envelope)\n\t\tTerrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThanks, Lloyd.\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n\t\tYes, sir.  You're just what we needed on a night\n\t\tlike this.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh ... thanks.\n\n\tFrank glances at Jack and realizes he should have left\n\thim in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone.\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n\t\tOnly, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you\n\t\twanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go\n\t\tplay with the niggers on State Street.  These\n\t\tblisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some\n\t\tguy dripping ash all over himself while he's\n\t\tplaying 'The Sound of Music.'\n\n\tANGLE - JACK\n\n\tSmoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,\n\tlike a pit bull eyeing a steak.\n\n\tBACK TO SCENE\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n\t\tOkay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more\n\tlessons.  By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.\n\n\tLloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk and,\n\tbusiness closed, busies himself with other matters.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us\n\tback, do you, Lloyd?\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n\t\tI'll call you.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I\n\tthought maybe...\n\n\t\t\t\tLLOYD\n\t\tI'll call you.\n\n\tFrank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tCount it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tCount it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJack...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tCount the fucking money, Frank.\n\n\tLloyd looks up.  Jack is staring right into him.\n\tReluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt's all here.\n\t\t\t(pulling Jack out)\n\t\tI'll be talking to you, Lloyd.\n\n\tLloyd doesn't answer.  He just looks at Jack, smiling\n\twith amusement.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET - JACK AND FRANK\n\n\tJack comes out onto the street holding the wrapped\n\tsoup bone, dogged by Frank, who's got the cardboard\n\tstand-up under his arm.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou mind telling me what that was about in there?\n\t\tWas that planned?  \n\t\tOr were you just bored and decided\n\t\tto get creative?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFuck him.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThis isn't the Pine Tree Inn on\n\t\tRoute 81, Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFuck him.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(to himself)\n\t\tFuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.\n\n\tThe fabulous Bakers walk in silence until they come to\n\tFrank's car. Frank opens the trunk and starts to put\n\tthe stand-up away.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSo we on tomorrow night?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(shaking his head)\n\t\tMaybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the\n\t\tSheraton's got appendicitis.\n\n\tJack nods and starts to walk away.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\tJack stops.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen ... why don't you come out to the house\n\t\tthis weekend.  Say hello to the kids.  \n\t\tThey've grown.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI hate your kids, Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou're their uncle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tOnly by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThey don't.  They're always asking about you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThey tried to electrocute me, Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt was an accident.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIt was no fucking accident, Frank. The little\n\t\tone ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tCindy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tShe threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub.  \n\t\tHow do you explain that?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tShe didn't know what she was doing.\n\t\tYou're too sensitive.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou got weird kids, Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tLook, I just thought if you came out you might\n\t\tsee what you're missing.\n\n\tJack just stares at Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJust think about it, all right?\n\t\tConsider it a standing offer.\n\n\tFrank closes the trunk and moves to the driver's side.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing;like a litany)\n\t\tYou want a ride, Jack?  No, Frank,\n\t\tI'll walk.  Okay, Jack, good night.\n\t\tGood night, Frank.\n\n\tFrank turns the ENGINE OVER and pulls away from the curb.\n\tJack watches the taillights burn into the distance,\n\tthen takes the whiskey bottle from his coat and heads\n\tfor home.\n\n\tANGLE - APARTMENT BUILDING\n\n\tJack crosses the street and waves up to his apartment\n\tbuilding, where a black labrador is studying him from\n\ta second story window.\n\n\n\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT\n\n\tJack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably\n\tcluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone\n\tbooth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,\n\tEDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not\n\tan overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his\n\tface that he has a great deal of affection for Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHi, pal.  Thought you were gonna clean the\n\t\tapartment.\n\n\tEddie nuzzles the soup bone.  Jack unwraps the paper\n\tand hands it over.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTake it easy, will ya?  You're becoming a regular\n\t\tJohhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth\n\t\taround here.\n\n\tJack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over\n\tto an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.  \n\tHe lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the\n\tMACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky \"PEACE PIECE\" fills the\n\ttiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and\n\twalks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling\n\tback with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows\n\tgently on the keys and stares out the open window,\n\tlistening to the music.\n\n\n\tINT.  PIANO STORE\n\n\tJack and Frank work opposite sides of a large piano\n\tshowroom, inspecting rentals of every style and color.\n\tWILLIE, the owner of the place, leans against a cheap\n\tupright, contemplating his shoes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat happened to the two Clays, Willie?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n\t\tOut.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhen they coming in?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n\t\tWednesday next.\n\t\tFrank looks across the room at Jack.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat d'ya got?,\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tBosen black.\n\t\t\t(taps a key)\n\t\tFlat.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n\t\tWhat's the gig?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tTwo nights.\n\n\tWillie just looks at his shoes and shakes his head.\n\tFrank frowns and glances around.\n\tAcross the room, Jack pauses before another piano.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat d'ya got?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(tapping)\n\t\tYamaha white.  Nice.\n\n\tFrank moves to another grand and alternates taps with\n\this brother to see if the two pianos are in harmony.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tTry the black Knable.\n\n\tFrank moves to another piano and repeats the process,\n\twatching Jack for a verdict.\n\tAfter a moment, Jack nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tTag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown,\n\t\tThursday-Friday.  Thanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tWILLIE\n\t\tMy pleasure.\n\n\n\tINT.  DINER\n\n\tThe brothers sit at a window of a corner diner,\n\tJack nursing an ice coffee,\n\tFrank playing with a plate of scrambled eggs.  \n\tThe glass next to them is cluttered with photographs\n\tof neighborhood luminaries,\n\tincluding two of Jack and Frank in their tuxedoes.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou know, I think it's been five years since I\n\t\tsaw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tTrust me, you're not missing anything.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou look awful.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tReally.  You sleeping?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tOnly on odd days.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(a look)\n\t\tSeeing anyone in particular?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhy the interest?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tBecause I'm your brother.  Because I care about\n\t\tyou. Because sometimes it seems like the most\n\t\tsignificant relationship in your life is with\n\t\tthat goddamn dog of yours.\n\n\tJack studies his brother's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat about that waitress at the Ambassador?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tUh-uh.  How about you?  You seeing anyone?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tFunny.\n\t\t\t(points at his wedding band)\n\t\tStrike a bell?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIt's only a ring.  Not a collar.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt's more than that.\n\n\tJack smiles and sips his coffee.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBy the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo thanks.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNo, I mean it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSo do I.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWe gotta go, Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up\n\t\tthere every couple weeks you feel guilty.  \n\t\tI won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThis time you gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI don't gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou gotta go.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSays who?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYour older brother.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou're thirteen months older than me, Frank.\n\t\tThat might've meant something in the Apache\n\t\tclubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tChrist, Jack, it's her birthday.\n\n\tJack glances up.  Frank nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSo what do you say?\n\t\tThink the city can spare you for an afternoon?\n\n\tJack squints out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOkay.  And don't worry about a present.\n\t\tI got her something from both of us.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\n\tJack, cradling a pink bakery box in one hand,\n\tgets out of Frank's car and surveys the street\n\ton which he grew up.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tMake sure you lock.\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\tUnless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses\n\tthree houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth\n\tof potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity.\n\tBut it's not Jack's car, so he doesn't press the point.\n\n\tBACK TO SCENE\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tPlace looks good, huh?  I got a neighbor boy to\n\t\tmow the lawn, pick up. Five bucks.  \n\t\tTimes've changed, huh?\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tSee the tree?\n\t\tRemember the job Cecil did on it the day\n\t\tDad planted it?\n\t\tYou can still see the scars on the trunk.  Really.\n\t\tI was looking at it just the other day.\n\t\tJesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat.\n\n\tFrank smiles, recalling Cecil's near-demise,\n\tthen raps on the front door.\n\tJack studies the tree a moment,\n\tthen gestures to the tiny ribboned box in Frank's hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSo what'd we get her?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou'll see.\n\n\tANGLE - FRONT DOOR\n\n\tAt that moment, the door swings open and ELLIE BAKER\n\tis there, a vibrant woman in her sixties.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tWell, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHow's the birthday girl?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tA little stiffer, but just as sturdy.\n\n\tMrs. Baker hugs Frank, then, a bit awkwardly,\n\tembraces Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJohn.  It's good to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)\n\t\tGood to see you, Ma.\n\n\tJack looks over his mother's shoulder at Frank and\n\tmimics \"John\" with a knowing nod.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore.\n\t\tJack. He goes by Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tI thought maybe held gotten over that.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tTwenty years, Ma ...\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tYes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.\n\t\tJack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,\n\t\twe had a pig on the farm named Jack.\n\t\tI guess I just can't help making the association.\n\n\tJack's eyes slide over to Frank as if to suggest he\n\tholds his brother personally responsible for this.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma,\n\t\tJohn Kennedy went by Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tCatholics.  What do you expect?  \n\t\tOh, well, what's in a name, right?\n\t\tLet's go inside and have a look at that cake.\n\n\tAs Mrs. Baker exits, Frank leans over to Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tKeep her busy, will ya?\n\t\tI have to set a few things up.\n\n\tFrank disappears, leaving Jack alone on the porch\n\twith the bakery box.  Jack shakes his head,\n\twondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon,\n\tthen enters the house.\n\n\tINT.  HOUSE\n\n\tThe front room is cluttered with his childhood.  \n\tMost noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,\n\tperfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed\n\twith age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,\n\tare the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.\n\tFinally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,\n\tpiled everywhere in drunken stacks.\n\tThis and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,\n\twarily, but with a noticeable dispassion,\n\tuntil his eyes fall upon a photograph.\n\tIn it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man\n\tin baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.\n\n\tFrank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,\n\tperfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,\n\this shirt too big, is caught in profile,\n\tlooking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\t\t(entering)\n\t\tWell, now, where's everyone run off to?\n\t\tFrank?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tDownstairs.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tOh.\n\n\tAll at once, Jack and his mother realize they are alone.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tWell, shall we cut that cake?\n\n\tJack nods and follows her into the kitchen.\n\tHe places the box on the table and stands off to the\n\tside while Mrs. Baker sets about preparing things.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tSo. How are you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFine.  You?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tOh, fine.\n\n\tSilence.\n\tJack watches his mother poise the knife over the cake.\n\tHer fingers are trembling.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tBig piece or little?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHuh? Oh, no.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tNone?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI'm not much for sweets.\n\n\tMrs. Baker nods.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tHow's that dog of yours?  What was his name?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tEddie.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tYes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHe's losing his teeth.\n\n\tMrs. Baker stops and looks up into Jack's eyes.\n\tSuddenly, a NOISE is heard in the other room.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tSounds like your brothers back with us.\n\n\n\tINT.  KITCHEN - DAY\n\n\tFrank comes stumbling up the basement stairs with an\n\told movie projector and a roll-up screen.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\t\t(entering)\n\t\tWhat's all this?\n\n\tFrank sets the projector down and hands his mother the\n\ttiny ribboned box.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tGo on.\n\n\tJack watches from the kitchen doorway as Mrs. Baker\n\tpulls the ribbon off the box.  \n\tInside is a tiny spool of film.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tWhy, what's this?\n\n\n\tINT.  KITCHEN (LATER)\n\n\tBlank screen, curtains drawn, the room dark.  \n\tFrank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.  \n\tMrs. Baker close on his elbow,\n\tsets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.  \n\tJack sits off to the side.  \n\tA title card appears:\n\t\"For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible.\"\n\tMrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.  \n\tHe just smiles.\n\n\tSuddenly, images spring to the screen,\n\tobviously footage several years old,\n\tshowing Jack and Frank as children,\n\tsitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,\n\tsmiling matching smiles as they play for the camera.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tOh my God ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tRecognize these two characters?\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tI thought these were lost.  \n\t\tWhere did you find ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIn the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.\n\t\t\t(pointing with his fork)\n\t\tLook, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.\n\n\tAs Frank's laughter fills the dark room,\n\tJack stares with cold fascination at the screen.  \n\tSuddenly, a jagged cut springs the boys a year later,\n\tin the same positions, smiling the same smiles.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\t\t(laughing)\n\t\tOh no!\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI had a boy down at the camera shop cut them\n\t\tall together.  Boy, old man Henderson didn't\n\t\tfool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?\n\n\tJack says nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tOh, look at you two.  So skinny.\n\t\tAnd those tiny suits ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.\n\n\tJack's eyes narrow as the film jumps another year\n\tand a man enters the frame, obviously by accident.  \n\tHe is so tall his face cannot be seen.  \n\tAs he dances quickly out of sight,\n\the ruffles Jack's hair.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS. BAKER\n\t\tThat man.\n\n\tAs the film jumps again,\n\tJack glances at the photograph to his right.\n\tThe images on the screen flicker softly off\n\tthe glass of the picture frame.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER (O.S.)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOh, look how you're growing.\n\t\tMy little boys ...\n\n\tJack's eyes drift from the photograph to his mother\n\tand brother, sitting close together in the love seat,\n\tlaughing.  After a moment, their voices fade and Jack\n\tlooks back to the children on the screen,\n\tlike two tiny men, mirror images of one another.\n\tAt first the changes are subtle.  \n\tLittle Jack's tie is askew, his shirt missing a button.\n\tBut as the years flick by, the brothers resemble one\n\tanother less and less, until finally,\n\tthe little boy that was Jack is completely gone and in\n\this place is a slouching, tousle-haired adolescent in\n\trumpled coat and open collar,\n\ta cigarette hanging disdainfully from his lip.  \n\tA woman's hand darts into the frame and plucks the\n\toffending cigarette away in a flash.\n\n\n\tINT.  CAR\n\n\tFrank and Jack are parked in front of Jack's building.\n\tWhispers of steam snake from the\n\tmancovers in the street.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI made her nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHer hands.  Like that.\n\n\tJack holds out a trembling hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNah.  Medication.\n\n\tJack looks over at Frank.  He nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCouple years, now.\n\t\t\t(taps his heart)\n\t\tKeeps the beat steady.  Nothing serious.\n\n\tJack considers this a moment, then gets out of the car.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tShe was glad to see you.\n\n\n\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT\n\n\tJack lets himself into his apartment and stops.\n\tAcross the room, curled up on the couch, is a little girl.\n\tJack takes the girl gently in his arms and carries her to\n\tthe bedroom.  As he folds a blanket under her chin,\n\the pauses. The girl's face is calm, peaceful.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET - DAWN\n\n\tThe next morning.  Early.  \n\tThe sun is peeking sleepily between the buildings and\n\tbeginning to drip out onto the street.  Suddenly,\n\tRINGING OUT over the rooftops, is \"JINGLE BELLS\"\n\t-- not the entire song, just the first two bars,\n\tover and over.\n\n\n\tIHT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\tJack, on the couch, his arm draped over a slumbering\n\tEddie, opens his eyes.  Across the room,\n\tseated at the piano, is NINA, the little girl.\n\tShe stops playing and turns.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\tMorning.  You want coffee?  I made coffee.\n\n\tJack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up.\n\tHe nods to the coffee.  Nina goes to the kitchen.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI did the dishes last night. You're missing a cup.\n\n\tJack rubs his head, then gets up and walks to the window.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDid you break a cup, Jack?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tEddie did.\n\n\tNina looks at Eddie, sleeping on the couch,\n\tthen brings Jack his coffee with both hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\tI practiced the piano last night.  Two hours.\n\t\tI think I'm ready for 'Jingle all the way.'\n\n\tJack nods.  Suddenly, the sound of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS is heard.\n\tJack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGuess they're up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSounds big.  What's he do?\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\tProcess server.\n\t\tMa said it's like a lawyer only the hours\n\t\tare more regular.  All I know's he came to take\n\t\tthe TV one afternoon and ended up staying for\n\t\tdinner.  And breakfast.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat happened to the donut king?\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\tMarried.\n\n\tUpstairs, a DOOR SLAMS and HEAVY FEET ECHO in the\n\tstairwell. Nina peers out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\tNo breakfast.  Maybe they had a fight.\n\n\tTWO DEEP THUMPS sound on the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tNINA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, gotta go.  Teach me later?\n\n\tJack nods.\n\tNina kisses him on the cheek and exits.\n\tJack walks over to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHey.\n\n\n\tINT.  LUAU LOUNGE\n\n\tThough the plastic palms and grass-skirted waitresses\n\tof the Luau Lounge make the Fabulous Baker Boys' presence\n\tseem a bit incongruous, Jack and Frank hold nothing back,\n\tgiving \"McCarthur Park\" the full treatment.  \n\tUnfortunately, the audience in the Luau Lounge wouldn't\n\tfill a Hawaiian haystack and their applause\n\tis less than volcanic.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh, thank you.  That concludes our show for this\n\t\tevening.  Jack and I only hope you enjoyed\n\t\tyourselves as much as we did.\n\n\tAs the guests wander out, clutching their roomkeys,\n\ta freckle-faced BELLHOP comes up.\n\n\t\t\t\tBELLHOP\n\t\tMr. Baker.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(tired)\n\t\tYeah, Jimmy.\n\n\t\t\t\tJIMMY (BELLHOP)\n\t\tMr. Simpson asked to see you.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tAll right, tell him I'll be right there.\n\n\tAs Jimmy exits, Frank stands and points at Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTomorrow we close with the 'Aquarius Suite.'\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR\n\n\t\tFrank pauses before a door marked \"HOTEL MANAGER.\"\n\t\tIt's half-open.  Inside, CHARLIE SIMPSON,\n\t\ta heavy man in a shiny suit,\n\t\tis throwing darts in the general direction of a\n\t\tdartboard.  He's not very good.  Frank knocks.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tFrankie.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou wanted to see me, Charlie?\n\n\tANOTHER ANGLE\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYeah, come on in.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tLittle slow tonight.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\t\t(waving it off)\n\t\tMondays.\n\n\tCharlie takes an envelope from his desk and hands it\n\tto Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat's this?\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tYour pay.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNow?

You can't just --\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tIt's all there.

You and Jack been\n\t\tplaying here, a long time.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tTwelve years.\n\n\t\t\t\tCHARLIE\n\t\tRight, twelve years.

I gotta move the liquor.  \n\t\tTo move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables.  \n\t\tIt's a matter of economics.  Me, I love you.\n\t\tI love both you guys, you know that.  \n\t\tYou're class.  But people today.  \n\t\tThey don't know class if it walks up and\n\t\tgrabs 'em by the balls.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL LOBBY\n\n\tJack rises as Frank passes through the lobby with\n\tthe cardboard stand-up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat's with Charlie?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNothing.  Everything's great.\n\t\tTerrific.\n\n\n\tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE\n\n\tWith the stand-up under his arm,\n\tFrank enters and closes the door quietly.  \n\tA light is glowing in the kitchen.  \n\tThe rest of the house is dark, quiet.  In the kitchen,\n\the checks the message pad by the phone.  Nothing.  \n\tOn the table, a plate of cold chicken is waiting for him.\n\tNext to it is a stack of bills with a note attached:\n\t\"Frank. Please.\"\n\tFrank sighs and leans the stand-up against the wall.  \n\tThe photo of Jack is peeling off the cardboard.  \n\tFinding a stack of glossies in a drawer,\n\tFrank removes the old Jack from the stand-up and\n\treplaces it with a new one.  \n\tAs he presses the photograph in place,\n\this eyes drift to the one of himself.  \n\tIt was taken a long time ago.\n\n\n\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT\n\n\tJack places a record on the turntable and sits at the\n\tpiano by the window.  As the needle hits the spinning\n\tdisc, a sharp, snappy BASS LINE REVERBERATES throughout\n\tthe apartment.  Jack takes a drink, then joins in with\n\tthe record, playing along.  His concentration is intense,\n\tso much so that, a moment later, when the PHONE RINGS,\n\the seems not to hear it.  Finally, he picks it up.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.0.)\n\t\tIt's me.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFrank?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.0.)\n\t\tYeah.

After\n\t\tthe gig.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.0.)\n\t\tWe don't get a gig.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat're you talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.0.)\n\t\tSomething came up.  Don't worry,\n\t\tCharlie stayed true.  Both nights.\n\t\tI'll give you your share tomorrow.\n\t\tAt the house.\n\n\tSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK (V.0)\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSo you'll come out, right?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah, okay.\n\n\tJack listens to the PHONE HISSING in the dark,\n\tthen the CONNECTION goes DEAD.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\n\tA taxi lets Jack off on a street of shabby tract houses.  \n\tIn his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap\n\tgangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers.  \n\tHe walks up to the door of a small white house and\n\tpresses the doorbell.\n\tWhen there is no response, he goes around to the back.\n\n\tEXT. BACKYARD\n\n\tThe backyard is small, with a short chainlink fence\n\tsurrounding it.  Two kids, a girl and a boy,\n\tare splashing around in a build-it-yourself\n\tabove-ground pool.  \n\tWhen they see Jack, they stop splashing.\n\tOnly their heads are visible above the water.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHey, kids.  Dad home?\n\n\tThe two heads say nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat d'ya say?  Wanna run and get\n\t\thim for me?\n\n\tStill nothing.  Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette,\n\tand pats his pocket for a match.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tShit.\n\n\tThe kids' eyes widen at his profanity.  \n\tJack, the unlit cigarette dangling from his lip,\n\tponders things for a moment,\n\tthen flicks the'cigarette away and steps over the fence.\n\tAt which point,\n\tthe tinier of the two heads in the pool begins to scream.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey, kid.  Take it easy.\n\n\tNo use.  The kid's a world-class screamer.  \n\tFrank, wearing baggy shorts and looking alarmed,\n\tcomes racing out of the house.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tCindy!  What is it?\n\n\tCindy points.  At Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYour doorbell doesn't work.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHoney, it's only Uncle Jack.

Out of the pool.\n\n\tDonna shepherds the kids toward the house.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tFeet!\n\n\tThe kids wipe their dripping feet on the outside mat\n\tand disappear into the house.

Dangerous territory.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tA gust of wind killed him.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYeah, and what put him up there?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHey, you weren't there.  Right?\n\n\tJack's look ends this.

How much?\n\t\tFor the singer.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI thought maybe twenty percent.\n\t\tLook, with the additional bookings we'll\n\t\tcome out ahead.  The big hotels,\n\t\tthey want a pretty girl with a big voice.\n\t\tWe have to stay competitive, Jack.\n\n\tJack laughs coldly.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat's that?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou, Frank.  All these years you been telling me\n\t\twe're different.  We got novelty, Jack.\n\t\tNo one can touch us.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tTwo pianos isn't enough anymore,\n\t\tJack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIt never was.\n\n\n\tYOUNG WOMAN\n\n\tin pink sweater and a short black skirt stands in the\n\tcenter of a tiny room in the back of Willie's piano\n\tshowroom, holding some sheet music.  Sammy Davis Jr.'s\n\tface is on the sheet music.  Frank is sitting against\n\tthe opposite wall, a notepad in his hand.  \n\tJack is at the piano.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tGood morning, Miss...?\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUNG WOMAN\n\t\tMoran.

It's what I prefer.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWell, that's fine --\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tBut if you call my house and my mother answers,\n\t\task for Blanche.  If you ask for Monica, she'll\n\t\tthink you have the wrong number and hang up.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tRight.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tAnd if she asks what it's about, don't tell her.\n\t\tShe's opposed to my career.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh-huh.  Well, Miss Moran, what\n\t\tis it you'd like to do for us?\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tCandy Man.'\n\t\t\t(worried)\n\t\tIs that all right?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt's one of Jack's favorites.\n\n\tMonica turns and, seeing Jack at the piano,\n\tgives a little start.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tOops.  I almost forgot you were\n\t\tthere.  Here's the music.\n\n\tMonica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh... he knows it.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tReally?  Isn't that a coincidence.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSmall world.\n\n\tMonica smiles.  She likes Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWell, shall we?\n\n\tProbably not, but Jack begins to play anyway,\n\tlaconically picking out the cheery tune while Monica\n\tswings her arms and taps her foot. Despite all this,\n\tMonica still manages to come in between beats and Jack\n\thas to scramble over a chord to catch her,\n\tsort of like a fireman with a net.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tWho can take a sunrise\n\t\tSprinkle it with dew\n\t\tToss it in the air and\n\t\tMake a groovy lemon pie\n\t\tThe Candy Man can\n\t\tThe Candy Man can...,\n\n\tThere would appear to be ample evidence as to why the\n\tmother of Monica nee Blanche opposes her\n\tdaughter's career.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.\n\n\tMonicals eyes are closed now and she is fully caught up.\n\tFrank looks over at Jack.  \n\tJack shrugs and continues to play.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tMiss Moran ... Miss Moran ...\n\t\tBlanche!\n\n\tMonica's eyes pop open.\n\n\t\t\t\tMONICA\n\t\tOh, sorry.  I get so caught up in\n\t\tit sometimes.

As Frank sinks lower in his\n\tchair and Jack's ashtray spills over with wounded\n\tcigarettes, singer after singer, in all shapes, sizes,\n\tand colors, come forth to offer their own unique\n\tinterpretations of \"Feelings,\" \"I Gotta Be Me,\"\n\t\"This Is My Song,\" and perhaps most appropriately,\n\t\"What Kind of Fool Am I.\"\n\tFinally, when it is all over,\n\tJack and Frank are left alone in the tiny room,\n\tlooking dazed, exhausted, and mildly homicidal.\n\n\n\tTALL YOUNG WOMAN\n\n\tAs the sequence ends, a TALL YOUNG WOMAN in high heels\n\twalks into Willie's.

You\n\t\twould think someone ... anyone ...\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN (O.S.)\n\t\tDamn!\n\n\tThe Woman in high heels stumbles into the doorway,\n\tholding a shoe in her hand.

JACK'S APARTMENT\n\n\tJack enters with a small grocery bag and opens the\n\trefrigerator.  A carton of cream, a few eggs --\n\tthere's not much there.  He takes a small container of\n\tcottage cheese from the grocery bag and places it on an\n\tempty shelf.  As he closes the refrigerator door, he\n\tglances around the apartment.  It is very still, very\n\tquiet.  He looks up at the ceiling absently, then walks\n\tover to the window and looks out.  There is a mug of\n\tcoffee there on the sill.  He takes it and holds it in\n\tboth hands for a moment, then places it back on the sill.\n\tHe sits at the piano and runs his fingers lightly over\n\tthe ivory, not making a sound, then places his hands on\n\tthe keys and begins to play.  \"Jingle Bells.\"\n\n\n\tINT.

A WOMAN in a bright flowered gift shop\n\tdress pokes her head in.\n\n\t\t\t\tWOMAN\n\t\tI'm sorry to interrupt, but when I saw you sitting\n\t\there, I just had to come over.  Florence Simmons.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tUh ... Frank Baker.  This is my\n\t\tbrother.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS (WOMAN)\n\t\tOh, I know, I know.  My husband and I saw you\n\t\tplay last night and it's the most remarkable thing.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tOh. Well, thank you.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\tNo, I mean you.\n\t\t\t(to Jack)\n\t\tI have a brother-in-law who looks exactly like you.\n\t\tExactly.  You don't happen to have a Huckleberry\n\t\tin your family tree, do you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tAfraid not.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\tWell, it's frightening.  You could be his twin.\n\t\tOf course, he doesn't have your talent.  Musically,\n\t\tI mean.  He sharpens things for a living.  Lawn\n\t\tmower blades, kitchen knives, anything with an edge.\n\t\tCan imagine?\n\n\tJack is having a hard time imagining Florence Simmons.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, anyway, I just had to make sure there was\n\t\tno relation.  You play wonderfully.  Both of you.\n\n\tFlorence Simmons gives a little flutter of\n\ta wave and exits.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tFunny, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThinking there's someone who looks like you,\n\t\twalking around the street somewhere.\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tWonder if I saw him I'd think it\n\t\twas you?\n\n\n\tEXT.  HOTEL - DAY\n\n\tJack is standing on the walkway that encircles the\n\thotel, watching the waves tumble into one another.  \n\tAs he starts to take out a cigarette, he notices\n\tFlorence Simmons standing a few yards away\n\twith a camera.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\tI just know my sister won't believe\n\t\tme. Do you mind?\n\n\tJack shakes his head and Florence starts to aim the\n\tcamera.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\tI really hate to impose.  It's just that the\n\t\tresemblance is so extraordinary.\n\t\t\t(focusing)\n\t\tI wonder if you could turn this way so your face\n\t\tisn't in the shadows.\n\n\tAs Jack turns, he glances over Florence's swaying\n\tshoulder and sees Susie and a man standing at the other\n\tend of the walkway.  They are leaning into the wind,\n\ther hair blowing free, brushing the man's face.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\tSay cheese.\n\n\tThe camera clicks.\n\n\t\t\t\tFLORENCE SIMMONS\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGotcha.  Would you like a copy for\n\t\tyourself?  The hotel develops.\n\n\tJack glances away from Susie and the man.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tON Jack's expression APPLAUSE is heard and a moment\n\tlater we --\n\n\tCUT TO:\n\n\n\tINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tThat evening.  The trio has just finished a song and\n\tthose on the dance floor are clapping.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThank you.  You know, before we came out here\n\t\tthis evening, Susie and Jack and I were looking\n\t\tover your dedications and something struck us.\n\n\tSusie and Jack look at Frank as if they have no idea\n\twhat he's talking about.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWe realized that, well, we're really not so\n\t\tdifferent from one another after all.  Oh sure,\n\t\twe may be at different points in our journey,\n\t\tbut we all travel pretty much the same road.\n\t\tAnd so, with that in mind, we'd like to introduce\n\t\tyou to two very special couples.  First, married\n\t\tfor all of two days, please say hello to Helen\n\t\tand Bud Wilson.  Helen.  Bud.\n\n\tThose standing on the dance floor applaud as the young\n\tcouple from the beat-up Eldorado make their way to the\n\tfront of the room.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAnd now, our second couple.  I'm talking about\n\t\tEthel and Bert Lane, ladies and gentlemen.  Now,\n\t\tEthel and Bert would be upset with me if I told\n\t\tyou they'd been married for fifty years.  Why?\n\t\tBecause, ladies and gentlemen, Ethel and Bert Lane\n\t\thave been married for seventy-five years!\n\n\tThe audience lets go with an audible \"ooh\"\n\tand applauds enthusiastically.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tEthel, Bert.  Get up here and\n\t\tshow these kids how it's done.\n\n\tA path is cleared and a tiny couple begins to make\n\ttheir way to the dance floor.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAren't they a sight?\n\n\tThey are indeed, and a sight slower getting to the\n\tdance floor than Frank anticipated.\n\n\tHe nods to Jack and they launch into \"The Anniversary\n\tWaltz,\" but have to keep repeating the opening passage\n\twhile they wait for Ethel and Bert.  Finally, everyone\n\ton the dance floor steps back and, with some help from\n\ta few waiters, who slide a section of tables out of the\n\tway, Ethel and Bert Lane begin to dance in the center\n\tof the room, slowly but wonderfully, while the younger\n\tcouple whirls around them like a youthful satellite.\n\n\n\tINT.  BATHROOM\n\n\tJack is sitting in the bathroom again, smoking.  He\n\thears Susie's door open, then VOICES -- hers and a\n\tman's.  He puts out his cigarette in the\n\tsink and leaves.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY\n\n\tThe next morning.  Frank, the early bird, is\n\treturning to the room with a newspaper under his arm.\n\tWhistling happily, he rounds the corner just in time to\n\tsee a man exit Susie's room.  Astonished, then outraged,\n\the goes to Susie's door and knocks sharply.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(opening door)\n\t\tForget your tie, handsome ...\n\t\tFrank!\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou want to tell me what the\n\t\thell's going on?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI just saw a man walk out of\n\t\tyour room.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tUh ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIn case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be\n\t\there.

I had my doubts\n\t\tabout you from the beginning\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHey!\n\n\tFrank and Susie turn.  Jack is standing in the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhat're you trying to do?  Wake\n\t\tup the whole goddamn hotel?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWe were just having a little\n\t\tdiscussion about morality.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tSome discussion.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI just saw a man walk out of your\n\t\troom!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou saw wrong.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHe's with the hotel.  I called him.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhat are you talking about?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWe had a leak in the bathroom.\n\t\tHe fixed it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tHe was wearing a suit.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHe had to come quickly.

Susie's eyes narrow.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tIt wasn't business.  It was pleasure.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tJust dinner and dance, right?\n\n\n\tINT.  DINING ROOM\n\n\tJack, Frank and Susie are sitting at a table in the\n\tsmaller dining room.  It is conspicuously quiet.  \n\tThe main course seems to be a conscious attempt to\n\tignore each other.  Finally, Susie looks at Frank.  \n\tThen Jack.  Then out the window.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tParadise.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJack and Frank's room.  It is New Year's Eve,\n\tjust before show time, and Jack and Frank are in\n\ttheir tuxes.  Frank is on the phone.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(into phone)\n\t\tYes, Daddy promises.  I'll bring you one of the\n\t\tlittle glasses, how's that?  Just like Grandma has.  \n\t\tIt has a picture of the hotel on it and everything\n\t\t...

I love you ...\n\n\tFrank sets the phone down and stares at it.  \n\tJack studies him a moment, then Frank suddenly\n\tclaps his hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, let's go.  The public waits.\n\n\n\tINT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tA mass of swarming, jubilant people.  The voices are\n\thigh and loud and there's not a hand without a\n\tchampagne glass.  Couples lean into one another\n\tintimately, dancing gaily between the tables, toasting\n\tstrangers without hesitation.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(yelling to be heard)\n\t\tAll right, everyone.  This is it.\n\t\tLet's hear it.  Ten.  Nine ...\n\n\tGradually, the entire room joins the chant.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK/EVERYONE\n\t\tEight.  Seven.  Six.  Five.\n\t\tFour.  Three.  Two!  ONE!\n\t\tHAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\n\tThere is a blizzard of confetti as people scramble to\n\tfind that certain someone to kiss in the new year.  \n\tIn this moment, Jack, Frank and Susie find themselves\n\toddly removed from the frantic cheer below them,\n\ttheir presence suddenly unnecessary, forgotten.  \n\tFinally, Susie walks over to Frank and gives him a kiss,\n\tthen goes to Jack.  They hesitate, then kiss lightly,\n\tpulling away and glancing awkwardly into each other's\n\teyes.  Frank sounds the first chord of \"Auld Lang Syne\"\n\tand Susie looks away from Jack and returns to her place\n\ton the stage.  As she begins to sing, the others in the\n\troom, all intimate friends for one brief moment,\n\tbegin to sing with her.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE/EVERYONE\n\t\tLest old acquaintances be forgot ...\n\n\tAs the voices slowly fade, they are joined by the\n\tsound of the OCEAN until the ocean is all we hear\n\tand we see:\n\n\n\tINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n\tJack, lying on his bed in the dark.  He opens his eyes,\n\tsquinting against the light from the bathroom, then\n\tglances over to Frank's bed and detects the outline\n\tof a body in the darkness.  Swinging his legs over the\n\tside, he sits up on the edge of the bed and rubs his eyes.\n\tSuddenly there is a rustle of blankets and the shadow in\n\tthe next bed shifts, falling into the shaft of light cast\n\tfrom the bathroom.  It is a little boy.  Startled, Jack\n\tstares at the sleeping boy, then hears movement in the\n\tbathroom.  Rising slowly, he walks to the bathroom and\n\tgently eases the door open a few inches.  Inside, swimming\n\tmurkily in the steamy mirror, is the reflection of a man.  \n\tHis back is to Jack, but Jack can see that the man is\n\tshaving.  As Jack lets his gaze drop to the floor, he sees\n\tthat water is dripping off the man's pant cuffs and\n\tgathering in pools on the bathroom floor ... Jack wakes\n\tup.  He stares at the ceiling, listening to the waves,\n\tthen lifts his head and looks to the bathroom.  It is\n\tdark. Turning, he glances at Frank's bed.  It's empty.\n\n\n\tINT.  DINING ROOM\n\tDark and soundless.  Balloons, streamers and the other\n\tdebris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow.  \n\tFrank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at\n\tthe ocean.  As Jack crosses the room, he looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tAh, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear.\n\t\tHappy New Year, little brother.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat're you doing down here?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tCelebrating.

It's just beginning.\n\t\tCome on, have a drink.  \n\t\tShow your big brother how it's done.\n\n\tFrank pours him a glass.  Jack notices the bottle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tExpensive hangover.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tA gift.

It seems they\n\t\thave this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids.\n\t\tAdults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with\n\t\tTimexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais\n\t\tand everyone has a grand time crawling around on\n\t\tthe front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a\n\t\tdance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in\n\t\ta different colored shell and at the end of the\n\t\tevening they crack themselves open.  It's our job\n\t\tto separate the yolks from the whites.\n\t\tSlippery business.\n\n\tFrank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then\n\tleans his head back, staring at the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou know, I've never kissed my wife on New Year's.\n\t\tNot once in twelve years.\n\n\tJack studies Frank as he stares at the ceiling.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThe Holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it?\n\t\tWith the blue glass.\n\n\tJack looks up at the chandelier.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThe Royal.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tRight.

He never told me\n\t\tanything.  Even though I was the oldest.  \n\t\tIt was always you two, running off, doing things\n\t\ttogether.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou could've come.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI could've.

Jack is sitting outside the hotel,\n\twatching HELEN and BUD WILSON pack up the Eldorado.  \n\tThe streamers, by now turned to mush, cling like oatmeal\n\tto the car's exterior.  After a moment, Frank exits with\n\ta little bag from the gift shop and pulls out a\n\ttiny souvenir shot glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWant one?\n\n\tJack shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAh well, the kids'll break a\n\t\tcouple anyway.\n\n\tSuddenly, across the parking lot, the voices of the\n\tnewlyweds are heard.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\tGive me the keys.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tYou're not going to drive.\n\n\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\tGive me the keys!\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tYou're not going to drive!\n\n\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\tIt's my goddamn car!\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tIt's our goddamn car!\n\n\t\t\t\tBUD\n\t\tGive me the keys.\n\n\t\t\t\tHELEN\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tBud hesitates, then makes a rush for his wife, but\n\tshe's too quick and runs to the other side of the car.\n\tFrustrated, he begins to run around the car like a\n\tmadman, trying to catch her.

JACK'S APARTMENT - DUSK\n\n\tA record is spinning on Jack's phonograph as the sun\n\tgoes down outside his window.  As we MOVE AWAY FROM\n\tthe phonograph and PAST the window, we FIND Jack at\n\tthe piano, playing along with the record,\n\tlost in concentration.\n\n\n\tEXT.  BUILDING - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\n\tSusie is working on a Paris Opal, pacing, occasionally\n\tglancing up at Jack's apartment, where the MUSIC can be\n\theard FAINTLY.  After a moment, she drops her cigarette\n\ton the sidewalk.  There are half a dozen others\n\talready there.\n\n\n\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT\n\n\tThe record finishes, but the needle doesn't pick up,\n\tbumping into the label.  Jack glances at the clock next\n\tto him and gets up.  He puts on a jacket, then takes a\n\tpair of gloves and pulls them on carefully.\n\n\n\tEXT.  BUILDING\n\n\tAs Jack comes out of his building, Susie stops pacing,\n\tsurprised.  Jack, wearing the same look of concentration\n\the had at the piano, doesn't see her and turns down the\n\tother end of the street.  Susie starts to call after\n\thim, but stops.\n\n\n\tEXT.  JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tThe sun is gone now and the moon is in the sky.  \n\tWe see the hot neon exterior of a tiny jazz club.\n\n\n\tINT.  CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tJack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where\n\ta trio is playing.  He has a drink in front of him,\n\tbut it is untouched.  After a moment, the trio finishes\n\tand the pianist, a huge black man named HENRY, nods to\n\tthe applause.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tHENRY\n\t\tThank you.  As most of you know, we like to shake\n\t\tthings up here every so often just to keep you\n\t\tpeople on your toes.  So I'm gonna take a little\n\t\trest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit\n\t\tin.  He drops by about once a year just to keep\n\t\this hands clean.  Ladies and gentlemen.  \n\t\tJack Baker.\n\n\tJack rises to polite applause and shakes Henry's hand.  \n\tAs he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment,\n\tnot moving, then nods to the two men behind him.  As they\n\tbegin to play, we recognize the music from the record.  \n\tJack waits, then brings his hands to the keys.  As he\n\tplays, his face is suddenly calm.  Peaceful.\n\n\n\tEXT.  CLUB - NIGHT\n\n\tLater.  Jack comes out of the club and into the night,\n\tlighting a cigarette as he moves up the street.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE (O.S.)\n\t\tYou were good.\n\n\tJack stops.

The bed may be magic, but\n\t\tthe mirror isn't.  You wake up the same old Susie.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI didn't always, you know.  If I liked the guy ...\n\n\tSusie looks at Jack, but he just takes a drink.

BAKER\n\t\tIs that the way it is?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tPretty much.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tHe mentioned you had a girl for\n\t\ta while.  A singer.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFor a while.  She left.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tYes, well, it's probably best.\n\t\tNo sense bringing someone else in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI suppose.\n\n\tMrs. Baker glances into the lounge, at the two pianos.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tFunny.  Watching tonight, I was\n\t\tremembering when you were young.\n\t\tHow I used to stand in the kitchen, listening to\n\t\tthe two of you practice while I did the dishes.\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tMy two little radios.  Sometimes I'd stop and go to\n\t\tthe door and just watch.  Sometimes your father\n\t\twould too.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tHe liked to listen to you play.\n\t\tDid you know that?\n\n\tJack shakes his head.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou miss him, don't you?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIt's been a long time, Ma.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tYes.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tI supposed you still have that old phone booth.\n\n\tJack nods.  Mrs. Baker smiles, then it fades.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHis love scared me, you know.  The day he died he\n\t\t left a flower on my pillow.\n\n\tJack looks puzzled.  Suddenly his mother reaches out\n\tand very gently touches her fingers to his face.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou look so like him.\n\n\tThey stand like this for a moment, connnected, then\n\tFrank steps in from the street.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYour limo's ready, Ma.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\tAll right.\n\n\tMrs. Baker takes her hand from Jack's face and turns\n\taway.  Just before she exits, she looks back.\n\n\t\t\t\tMRS.  BAKER\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGood night, Jack.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\n\tJack, walking home, turns a corner and suddenly stops.\n\tAcross the street, talking to a man, is Susie.  She says\n\ta few words to the man, then touches him lightly on the\n\tarm and begins to walk away.  Jack watches her retreat,\n\tthen follows, moving quicker as he draws close.  As he\n\treaches her, he gently touches her elbow and she turns.\n\tNot Susie.  The woman stares at Jack, startled.  \n\tFor a moment, he doesn't move.  Finally, he lets go of\n\ther elbow.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSorry.\n\n\n\tINT.  CAR - NIGHT\n\n\tA few nights later.  Frank guides the car through wet\n\tcity streets.

HALLWAY\n\n\tJack and Frank make their way down a hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThe guy said to find Studio E and\n\t\tturn right.  What's that say?\n\n\tSuddenly, a rapid-fire THUMPING SOUND resounds through\n\tthe corridor.  As Jack and Frank turn, they see a huge\n\tYOUTH in a wheelchair dribbling a basketball toward them.\n\n\t\t\t\tYOUTH\n\t\tFast break!\n\n\tJack and Frank step back and watch the kid one-wheel it\n\taround the corner.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI guess it's that way.\n\n\n\tINT.  STUDIO\n\n\tJerry Lewis need not fear.  This is strictly a tin foil\n\tand crepe paper operation. Along one wall is the \"phone\n\tbank,\" monitored by a few sleepy volunteers, and opposite,\n\tin makeshift bleachers, is the audience.  A huge tote board,\n\tset on rolling astors, is next to the phones.  The total,\n\tat 2:15 AM, is $1125.38. As Jack and Frank enter, the kid\n\tin the wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the\n\tcamera.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThis must be it.  I'll see when\n\t\twe're on.\n\n\tFrank leaves. Jack glances around the studio like he's\n\twalked into a nightmare.  At the phone bank, a heavyset\n\tMAN in a sweatshirt and a cap, looks over.  Both the\n\tsweatshirt and the cap have \"Earl\" printed on them.\n\n\t\t\t\tEARL (MAN)\n\t\tYou the magician?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tEARL\n\t\t\t(disappointed)\n\t\tOh.

Tore it up against St. Anthony's.  Right\n\t\tbefore the accident.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tAccident?\n\n\t\t\t\tEARL\n\t\tThe fire.  The way we're going we'll be lucky to\n\t\tbuy a carton of jockstraps, let alone a new gym.\n\n\t\tAs Jack registers this, Earl's PHONE RINGS.  Frank\n\t\treturns and gestures to the kid in the wheelchair.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWe're on after Meadowlark.\n\t\t\t(seeing Jack's face)\n\t\tWhat's wrong?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tAre you kidding me?

He's VINCE NANCY,\n\tthe host.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\tLet's hear it for our own Jimmy\n\t\tMarshall, shall we?\n\n\tThe audience applauds.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAs most of you'know, young Jimmy put a nasty twist\n\t\ton that knee trying to win-one for good ol' Grant\n\t\tHigh this year.  Luckily, the doctors tell us\n\t\tJimmy'll be able to play next season.  That is ...\n\t\tif there is a next season.\n\t\t\t(Uncle Sam)\n\t\tThat's where you come in.

Come on out here guys.\n\n\tVince gestures grandly to the left and Jack and\n\tFrank enter from the right.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWhoops, there they are.  Hey, nice\n\t\tsuits, fellas.\n\t\t\t(to camera)\n\t\tNow I know a lot of you amateur musicians out\n\t\tthere are going to want to rap with these guys and\n\t\tdon't worry.  Right after they finish up here,\n\t\tthey're going to be manning the phones.  Maybe we\n\t\tcan even convince them to raffle off a few piano\n\t\tlessons if we're lucky.  What do you think?\n\n\tThe audience applauds.  Jack glares at Frank.  He shrugs.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tWell, all right then.  What are we\n\t\twaiting for?  Take it away, guys.\n\n\tJack and Frank poise their hands over their pianos and\n\tbegin to play.  As the music rises, the studio becomes\n\tvery quiet, almost still.  Unfortunately, Jack and Frank\n\tare barely through the opening passage when a thunderously\n\tLOUD BELL begins to RING.  Suddenly, Vince steps out\n\tagain.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tUh oh.  We know what that means, don't we?  It's\n\t\ttime to turn the board over.\n\t\t\t(to Jack, Frank)\n\t\tI'm afraid you fellas'll just have to wait a minute.  \n\t\tLet's bring out the board.\n\n\tTwo post-pubescent giants roll out the tote board\n\tright in front of Jack and Frank.  \n\tJack looks positively homicidal.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJack ...\n\n\tJack kicks out the piano bench and starts to leave.  \n\tThen, seeing the kid in the wheelchair, he grabs the\n\tbasketball and fires it at Vince.\n\n\t\t\t\tVINCE\n\t\tWhat the --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(pointing)\n\t\tYou're a fucking creep, you know\n\t\tthat.

Three hundred dollars.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tYou gonna talk to me?  Or is this Jack's famous\n\t\tsilent act?  Look, it was for publicity.  \n\t\tDo you understand?  Publicity.\n\n\tJack stops and stares at Frank incredulously.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat-are you?  A fucking moron?\n\t\tIt's three o'clock in the morning,\n\t\tFrank.  Who's watching?  Your wife?\n\t\tMaybe you can get us a gig playing\n\t\tLittle Frank's birthday party.\n\t\tWhat do you think?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tLook.  I didn't know when we were going to be on\n\t\tuntil yesterday.  What was I supposed to do?  \n\t\tI had the pianos anyway.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tBasketballs, Frank.  You had us\n\t\tplaying for basketballs.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI'm sorry.  I should've checked it out.  I screwed\n\t\tup.  But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle\n\t\tof a gig.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(incredulous)\n\t\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt wasn't professional, Jack.  It was a stunt.  \n\t\tA stupid-ass stunt.\n\n\tJack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat's happening to you, Frank?  You been kissing\n\t\tass so long you're starting to like it?  You let\n\t\tthat guy turn us into clowns tonight.  We were\n\t\talways small time, but we were never clowns, Frank.  \n\t\tWhat's happened to your dignity?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tDignity?  Who the hell are you to\n\t\ttalk about dignity?\n\n\tFrank suddenly steps forward and reaches into Jack's\n\tjacket, coming away with a bottle.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tThis where you get your dignity, Jack?  \n\t\tThis is where you get your courage?\n\n\tJack tries to grab the bottle but Frank holds it away.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tNo, let's do it straight for\n\t\tonce, shall we?\n\n\tFrank tosses the BOTTLE into the street, where it\n\tSHATTERS.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLet me explain something to you, little brother.  \n\t\tSee, I've got people who depend on me.  I've got\n\t\ta wife and two children who expect to wake up every\n\t\tmorning with food on the table and heat in the house.  \n\t\tI got a mortgage.  I got car payments.  I got Ma's\n\t\tmedical bills. Oh yeah, and I got you.  Yeah, you.  \n\t\tJack the shadow who's so cool and so hip and so\n\t\tfucking sure he's better than everyone else.  Don't\n\t\tyou think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes\n\t\tand blow smoke in his face?  Goddamn right I would.  \n\t\tBut I can't.  Because I have to be responsible, little\n\t\tbrother.  I have to make sure the numbers balance out\n\t\tin my favor at the end of each month so everyone can go\n\t\ton living their lives.  You don't win medals for it,\n\t\tbut you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I\n\t\tfolded up shop.  So don't talk to me about dignity,\n\t\tlittle brother.  You're drawing on a weak hand.\n\n\tJack stares at Frank through the rain,\n\tthen turns and begins to walk away.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tGreat.  Terrific.  Walk away.  You're good at that,\n\t\tJack.  Just don't forget to stop off for another\n\t\tbottle of courage on your way home.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tThat's what he'd do.\n\n\tJack stops, his back to Frank.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou've found the perfect solution to all the\n\t\tpain in the world, haven't you, little brother?  \n\t\tEight-fifty a bottle, available any time day or\n\t\tnight at your friendly neighborhood liquor store.  \n\t\tYou're weak, Jack.  Just like he was.\n\n\tJack turns, tough and dangerous in the darkness.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tStay off it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNo, let's stay on it.  I'm sick and tired of\n\t\twatching you make him up into some kinda god.  \n\t\tFor Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid\n\t\tbullshit jig.  He left a wife and two sons.  He\n\t\twasn't a hero.  He was a fool.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(eerily cold)\n\t\tYou weren't there.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThat's right.  I wasn't there.

And fuck him too.\n\t\tFuck the both-of you.\n\n\tJack suddenly bolts for,ward and grabs Frank by the\n\tlapels.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey, what're you doing?  Hey!\n\n\tJack flings Frank against the wall, pounding, pulling\n\tand slamming him in a fitful rage.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing; scared)\n\t\tJack! ... Jack! ...\n\n\tFrank slides to the ground, afraid, trying to protect\n\thimself.  Jack hovers over him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHow's it feel to have your little brother beat\n\t\tthe shit out of you?  Huh?  Huh!\n\n\tJack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face.  \n\tFrank holds up his hands, trying to shield himself,\n\tand catches a blow on his fingers.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tMy hands!  My hands!\n\n\tJack grabs one of Frank's hands.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(mocking)\n\t\tYour hands.  Your hands couldn't take the blue\n\t\tribbon on amateur night.\n\n\tJack bends back Frank's fingers.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(terrified)\n\t\tJack!\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWho's weak now, big brother?\n\n\tJack pushes Frank's fingers until the knuckles crack.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJack!  JACK!\n\n\tFrank's voice echoes high above the sound of the rain.  \n\tSuddenly Jack stops.  Looking at Frank's hand, still\n\tclasped in his, he seems as shocked by his own behavior\n\tas Frank.  Letting go, he steps back awkwardly and looks\n\tat his brother, beaten, to the ground, his tuxedo ripped\n\tand dirty.  He stares at his own hands, the knuckles split\n\tand bleeding.  He no longer looks dangerous.  He looks\n\thollow, frightened.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI'm through with it.  I can't do\n\t\tit anymore.\n\n\tFrank, rubbing his fingers, glances up at Jack, but Jack\n\tjust turns away, leaving Frank on the sidewalk, and\n\tdisappears into the rain.  MUSIC begins.  A sad, plaintive\n\tsolo piano.  And we see:\n\n\n\tSERIES OF SHOTS\n\n\tJack, crossing the street to his apartment, the rain\n\tover now.\n\n\tFrank, driving home, his face swollen and bruised in the\n\tdim glow of the streetlights.\n\n\tJack, letting himself into his apartment and standing\n\tthere.  Alone.\n\n\tFrank, easing the car into the driveway, turning off\n\tthe engine.\n\n\tJack, taking a bottle from the kitchen, moving numbly.\n\n\tFrank, much later, still sitting in the driveway as\n\tthe sun begins to come up.\n\n\tJack, sitting in the phone booth, the bottle in his hand.\n\n\n\tINT.  JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\n\tThe next morning.  Jack is sitting on the windowsill,\n\twatching the RAIN DRUM the GLASS.  He glances at the phone\n\tacross the room, takes another look at the rain, then goes\n\tto the phone.  He picks it up hesitantly, then dials.  \n\tIt rings.  Again.  Again.\n\n\t\t\t\tCINDY (V.0.)\n\t\tHello?\n\n\tJack blinks.  It's Cindy.\n\n\t\t\t\tCINDY\n\t\tHello ... Hellooooo ...\n\t\t\t(fainter)\n\t\tDaddy.  Daddy!  Someone's on the\n\t\tphone and they won't talk.\n\n\tJack sets the phone back down on the cradle.\n\n\n\tINT.  BAR\n\n\tJack stands in a dark bar.  It is early morning and the\n\tlight from the street gives the room a ghostly atmosphere.  \n\tA big, beefy MAN with a bar towel hooked in his belt is\n\ttalking to Jack.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tIf they wanna talk about their wife, you listen.  \n\t\tIf they wanna talk about their job, you listen.  \n\t\tIf they wanna talk about their parakeet, you listen.  \n\t\tThat's it, six nights a week, nine to one or until I\n\t\tsend you home.  Okay?\n\n\tJack nods and points to the piano in the corner.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThat it?\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tHow many you need?\n\n\tJack walks over to the giano and strikes a note.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIt's out of tune.\n\n\t\t\t\tMAN\n\t\tTrust me, the way I fix a martini,\n\t\tit'll be in tune.\n\n\tThe MUSIC RETURNS, sad and plaintive, and we see:\n\n\n\tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE\n\n\tFrank, attempting to give piano lessons to a brother\n\tand sister tandem who would be better served by an\n\tobedience school.  While the little girl pounds\n\tincessantly on the piano, her brother runs circles\n\taround the room, destroying everything in sight.\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES and we see:\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\tJack and Eddie, going for a walk, passing the diner\n\twhere Jack and Frank's pictures are still displayed.\n\n\tMUSIC CONTINUES and we see:\n\n\n\tINT.  BAR\n\n\tJack, in the bar, playing the music we've been hearing\n\tthroughout the previous scenes.  It is after midnight\n\tand the tables are empty.  Only a few somber men remain\n\tat the bar.  They do not appear to be music lovers.  \n\tAs Jack finishes, he takes a cloth and wipes the keys.  \n\tThere is a glass on the piano with money in it.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE (O.S.)\n\t\tI thought the Bakers didn't take\n\t\ttips.\n\n\tJack glances up, but he knows the voice.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI give it all to charity.\n\n\tSusie nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tSaw the sign outside.  Got your\n\t\town sign, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah.  Got my own sign.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tSo ... ?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWe outgrew each other.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tYeah, well, like I said, it didn't\n\t\tfigure.  You two.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou don't pick your brother.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSo how's the cat food business?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tTerrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.\n\n\tJack nods.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat kind?\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tHuh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tVegetables.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tOh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of\n\t\tthe important ones.\n\n\tSusie tries a smile.  Takes a breath.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tListen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new\n\t\tplace.  Or we could go to a bar ...\n\t\t\t(looking around)\n\t\tWell, maybe not a bar.  But I know\n\t\ta place uptown, if you want --\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI've given it up.\n\n\tSusie stops.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tNo kidding?  Well ... I guess you can't do a\n\t\treunion over tomato juice, can you?\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tAnyway, if you're ever in the\n\t\tneighborhood ... I wrote it down.\n\n\tSusie takes a slip of paper from her purse and hands\n\tit to Jack.  They lock eyes for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tTell egghead I said hi.  If you\n\t\tsee him.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tIf I see him.\n\n\tSusie nods and walks toward the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey.\n\t\t\t(as she stops)\n\t\tYou got pretty eyes.\n\n\tSusie smiles.  As she leaves, Jack studies the slip\n\tof paper in his hand, then drops it in the tip glass.  \n\tHe glances at the door, swinging slowly shut in Susie's\n\twake, then reaches into his coat and takes out a bottle.\n\n\n\tINT.  FRANK'S DEN\n\n\tFrank sits alone in the darkness of the den.  The\n\tcardboard stand-up is there, along with several old\n\tphotographs, including one showing two skinny kids in\n\ttuxes standing with a glamorous Peggy Lee.  After a moment,\n\tDonna enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\tFrank?  It's late, honey.\n\n\tFrank stays staring at the photograph of Peggy Lee.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tMrs. Lerner called after dinner.  Robbie can't make\n\t\this lesson tomorrow.\n\n\tDonna waits for her husband to say something, then sees the\n\tphotograph in his hand.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou know how good he is?  It's like breathing\n\t\twith him.  I've always envied it.  But tonight,\n\t\tlooking at all this -- at his face -- I don't know.  \n\t\tMaybe it's worse.  For him.\n\t\t\t(gesturing to the piano)\n\t\tIt's funny.  When I sit here and play ... nothing.  \n\t\tBut when I was up there with him...\n\t\tIt was like I had the gift, too.\n\n\n\tINT.  FRANK'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NEXT DAY\n\n\tFrank is standing in the hallway of his house, leaning\n\tagainst the bathroom door.  It's locked.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tCome on, Jeremy.  Open the door.\n\n\tSomewhere in the house, the PHONE RINGS.  \n\tFrank ignores it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJeremy.  You want me to call your father?  \n\t\tHe's not going to be very happy when he hears\n\t\the's spending fifteen dollars an hour for you\n\t\tto sit on the toilet.\n\n\tDonna, looking shaken, steps into the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\tHoney ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYou believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm\n\t\tplaying 'Camptown Races' for him and the next\n\t\tthing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom.  \n\t\tThere's nothing sharp in there, is there?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\tHoney ...\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWhere are our kids?  \n\t\tHas he got one of them in there?\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\tFrank.\n\n\tFrank finally looks at his wife.  She's crying.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n\n\tJack rushes down a hospital corridor and heads for the\n\tnurses station.  As he moves to the counter, Donna\n\tappears.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tDonna.  Where is she?\n\n\tDonna just shakes her head.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\tWe tried the apartment, but after\n\t\tthat we didn't know where to call.\n\n\tJack looks frozen.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tFrank'll be back in a moment.  \n\t\tHe took Little Frank to the bathroom.\n\n\tJack begins to back away slowly.\n\n\t\t\t\tDONNA\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJack ...\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\n\tJack moves aimlessly down the street, slipping in\n\tand out of shadows.  Finally he stops inside a closed\n\tstorefront, his back up against the window, and looks\n\tdown at his hands.  They're shaking.\n\n\n\tINT.  APARTMENT HALLWAY\n\n\tJack stands in an apartment hallway, waiting.  \n\tAfter a moment, the door opens.  It's Susie.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tJack.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHi.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tWell, this is some surprise.\n\t\t\t(seeing his face)\n\t\tHey ... You don't look so good, pal.\n\n\tSusie studies Jack as he glances around the hallway.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tJack?\n\n\tJack looks up.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tYou want to come in?\n\n\tHe nods.  Susie steps back and Jack enters.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLet me get the light.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tNo.\n\n\tHe stares directly into her eyes.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLeave it dark.\n\n\n\tINT.  SUSIE'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\n\tJack is standing at the foot of the bed, looking down\n\tat Susie's naked back as she sleeps.  He studies her\n\tface as if looking for something, then takes his coat\n\tand begins to leave.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tI used to do that.\n\n\tJack turns.  Susie is looking at him.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tSneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could\n\t\twake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on\n\t\tthe other end of it, though.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI didn't want to wake you.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(smiling slightly)\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThanks.  For letting me in last night.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tFunny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over.  \n\t\tLike a song.\n\n\tJack looks at Susie for a long moment, then nods and\n\tturns for the door.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey.\n\n\tJack stops, his hand on the doorknob.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAm I gonna see you again?\n\n\tJack looks at her face, beautiful in the morning light.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah.  You're gonna see me again.\n\n\tSusie smiles slightly.\n\n\t\t\t\tSUSIE\n\t\tOkay.\n\n\n\tEXT.  STREET\n\n\tJack is standing across the street from his mother's\n\thouse, just looking.  After a moment, he crosses the\n\tstreet.  As he moves up the drive, he takes notice of\n\tthe tree growing in the front yard and crosses to it,\n\tkneeling by the trunk and studying the scars there --\n\tcat's claws -- running vertically up the tree, the\n\tdamage smoothed and widened by time.  He runs his\n\tfingers over the imperfection, then stands and walks\n\ttoward the house.\n\n\n\tEXT.  HOUSE\n\n\tThrough the screen door, Jack can hear a CLICKING\n\tsound and see partially into the front door.  Half\n\tthe room is cast in shadow, the other in blinding light.  \n\tHe opens the door and enters.\n\n\n\tINT.  HOUSE\n\n\tInside, the movie PROJECTOR is RUNNING, the tail of a\n\tcompleted FLIP SLAPPING like a whip against the carriage.  \n\tJack TURNS OFF the PROJECTOR and the room falls entirely\n\tinto shadow.  For a moment, the house is silent, full of\n\tghosts, then, gradually, a NOISE is heard coming from the\n\tkitchen.\n\n\n\tINT.  KITCHEN\n\n\tAs Jack comes into the kitchen, he finds Frank searching\n\tthrough a cabinet.  He watches for a moment.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat're you looking for?\n\n\tFrank turns quickly, surprised.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI didn't hear you come in.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tWhat're you doing?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\tOh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But\n\tit seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of\n\tcooking sherry.\n\n\tJack nods.  Frank looks nervous.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tUh, we already boxed some things.  I figured you'd\n\t\twant to go through Dad's stuff.  It's in there.  \n\t\tIf you want to get started.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tLater.\n\n\tFrank nods.  Silence.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tIs everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tOh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know.  \n\t\tShe and Dad had taken care of it.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tRight.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're\n\t\tdoing the stone today.\n\t\t\t(pause)\n\t\tIt's okay?  Wednesday?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah, fine.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tThere's not going to be a viewing.\n\t\tI figured with the kids and all ...\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tSure.\n\n\tJack glances around the room.  Pictures on the walls.  \n\tHandmade curtains, lightly faded.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tIt's funny.  Before, whenever I came here, the\n\t\thouse seemed small.  But today ... I can't keep\n\t\tup with it. I keep losing my wind.\n\n\tFrank smiles slightly and he and Jack lock eyes for a\n\tmoment.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing;glancing away)\n\t\tGod, I could use a drink.\n\n\tJack hesitates, then pulls a bottle out of his coat.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tOh. Well, great.  I'll get a couple glasses.\n\n\tFrank moves to a cabinet, but there's nothing there.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tDamn.  Donna must've packed\n\t\tthem up this morning.\n\n\tJack holds out the bottle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tGo ahead.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNo.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\t\t(showing the seal is unbroken)\n\t\tBought it on the way over.  Clean\n\t\tas a nun.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tNo, it's not that.  I ... can't\n\t\tdrink from the bottle.  I ... gag.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tOh, yeah, right.  I forgot.\n\n\tFrank looks embarrassed.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(remembering)\n\t\tOh, hey, I want to show you\n\t\tsomething.  Come on.\n\n\tJack follows Frank back into the front room.  Frank\n\tstands before one of the tiny matching pianos and\n\tgestures Jack to the other.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHit the C. Go ahead.\n\n\tJack steps over to the other piano and taps, then Frank\n\tdoes the same.  Jack glances up in surprise.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tI'm right, aren't I? They're\n\t\tin tune.\n\n\tJack hits the note again and nods in amazement.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tAll these years.  She kept them in tune.  \n\t\tCan you imagine?  \n\t\tNow why would she do something like that?\n\n\tFrank looks down at the keys and his smile fades.  \n\tSuddenly he notices the collection of tiny souvenir shot\n\tglasses on top of the piano, each bearing the name of a\n\tdifferent hotel.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tHey, what do you know.  Looks like we can have\n\t\tthat drink after all.\n\t\t\t(picking up a few glasses)\n\t\tWhat's your pleasure?  We got the downtown Ramada.  \n\t\tWe got the Travelodge on Route 41.  \n\t\tAnd ... the Mallory.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI'll take the Mallory.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tGood choice.\n\n\tFrank blows some dust off the glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tLooks like these got a few years on them.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tThis'll kill 'em.\n\n\tJack pours and he and Frank settle on the tiny piano\n\tbenches.  As Frank swallows, he winces.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJesus.\n\n\tIt suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old\n\tfamiliar place, staring into his glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tHow're your hands?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(surprised)\n\t\tOh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple\n\t\tsore knuckles.  Nothing.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYou know, that night, I ... It\n\t\tjust all came up.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYeah, I know.  Me, too.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tI mean, you can play.  You're\n\t\tokay.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(smiling)\n\t\tI can keep the beat.\n\n\tJack smiles slightly, then both go back to their glasses.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\t\t(continuing)\n\t\tCharlie called.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah?\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tYeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others.  \n\t\tDonna said even Lloyd called the other day.  \n\t\tNothing like a little absence to make the heart\n\t\tgrow fonder, huh?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tYeah.\n\n\tJack and Frank lock eyes again.  \n\tFrank's glance drops to Jack's glass.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tJesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tFive years ago.\n\t\t\t(thinking)\n\t\tNovember.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tRight.  It was someone's birthday.\n\t\tHalloran?\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tDaughter's.  Sweet sixteen.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tChrist, that's right.  How could\n\t\tI forget.  What a nightmare.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tShe asked for it.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tI told Halloran we didn't do\n\t\tvocals, but he said:\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK AND FRANK\n\t\t\t(in unison)\n\t\tWhat my Sissy-wants, my Sissy gets.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tShe got it all right.\n\n\tJack and Frank glance at one another, little boy\n\tmischief glowing in their faces.  Suddenly they swivel\n\ton the pianos and begin to play \"You're Sixteen.\"\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK AND FRANK\n\t\t\t(singing)\n\t\tShe comes on like a dream\n\t\tPeaches and cream\n\t\tLips like strawberry wine\n\t\tShe's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine.\n\t\tRibbons and curls\n\t\tOoh, what a girl\n\t\tEyes that sparkle and shine\n\t\tYou're sixteen, you're beautiful, and you're mine.\n\n\tAs Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing.  After a\n\tmoment, their voices die and the house is quiet again.  \n\tFull of ghosts.  Each stares at the tiny keyboard before\n\thim, awkward with the intimacy of the moment.  It is\n\tquiet for a very long time.  Finally, Frank looks over.\n\n\t\t\t\tFRANK\n\t\tWell ... One more time?\n\n\tJack glances up and sees Frank has his empty glass\n\theld out.  He hesitates, then picks up the bottle.\n\n\t\t\t\tJACK\n\t\tOne more time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabulous Baker Boys, The\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0Steven Kloves\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Drama\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:24:57.907950"}
