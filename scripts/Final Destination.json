Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.\n\nThe Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.\n\nA male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage.

Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.\n\nCarter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.\n\n<b>                        CARTER\n</b>            Alex was right.\n\nClear looks up.\n\n<b>                        CARTER (CONT'D)\n</b>            It did skip us.\n\nClear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...\n\n<b>                        CLEAR\n</b>            I believe... that's what Alex\n            believed. But how do we know... this\n            wasn't the design all along?\n\nClear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... \"FLIGHT 180.\"\n\nCAMERA HOLDS as \"Long May You Run\" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.\n\n<b>                                                        FADE OUT.\n</b>\n</pre>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\">\n</td><td><h1>Final Destination</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=James Wong\" title=\"Scripts by James Wong\">James Wong</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Glen Morgan\" title=\"Scripts by Glen Morgan\">Glen Morgan</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Horror\" title=\"Horror Scripts\">Horror</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Final Destination Script.html#comments\" title=\"Final Destination comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:05:21.160669"}
