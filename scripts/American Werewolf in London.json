MOON\n\n     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the\n     song \"Moon Shadow\" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are\n     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is\n     superimposed.\n\n               An American Werewolf in London\n\n     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it\n     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the\n     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.\n\n2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans\n     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a\n     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to\n     have earned their literary reputation.\n\n     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,\n     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,\n     climbs down.\n\n     \"Moon Shadow\" ends.\n\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams\n     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened\n     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both\n     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in\n     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.\n\n     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none\n     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and\n     stretch.\n\n     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER\n\n     They've been cramped for hours.\n\n                         TRUCK DRIVER\n               Here, lads, East Proctor and\n               all about are the moors.  I go\n               east here.\n\n                         JACK\n               Yes, well thank you very much\n               for the ride, sir.  You have\n               lovely sheep.\n\n                         TRUCK DRIVER\n                    (as he clambers back\n                     up on his truck)\n               Boys, keep off the moors.\n               Stay on the road.  Good luck\n               to you.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Thanks again!\n\n     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry\n     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put\n     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing\n     towards East Proctor.\n\n     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     As they walk, their breath visible:\n\n                         JACK\n               Are you cold?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Yes.\n\n                         JACK\n               Good.\n\n     They walk on, finally:\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jack.\n\n                         JACK\n               David.\n\n                         DAVID\n               You're not having a good time\n               are you?\n\n                         JACK\n               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look\n               around.  Isn't this a fun\n               place?\n\n     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,\n     foreboding.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Well, I like it here.\n\n                         JACK\n               I'm sorry.

EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT\n\n     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly\n     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all\n     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a\n     very small population and the place looks empty.  David\n     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The\n     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and\n     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.\n\n4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT\n\n     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody\n     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, \"The\n     Slaughtered Lamb\".\n\n                         JACK\n               The Slaughtered Lamb?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Of course, The Slaughtered\n               Lamb.  Why else would they\n               have a severed fox head on a\n               spear as their symbol?\n\n                         JACK\n               That's a wolf's head.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Of course, The Slaughtered\n               Lamb.  Why else would they\n               have a severed wolf's head on\n               a spear as their symbol?\n\n                         JACK\n               That's not a spear.  It's a\n               pike.\n\n                         DAVID\n               A severed wolf's head on a\n               pike as their symbol.\n\n                         JACK\n               David, before we go in there I\n               want you to know that - no\n               matter what happens to us -\n               it's your fault.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I assume full responsibility.\n\n                         JACK\n               Okay.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Shall we?\n\n5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT\n\n     The pub was apparently \"modernized\" sometime in the mid-\n     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with\n     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by\n     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older\n     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.\n     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are\n     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is\n     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about\n     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They\n     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types\n     and the general level of noise in the room.\n\n     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead\n     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at\n     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the\n     strange attention.  They give each other a \"what?\"\n     look, then turn to the assembled populace.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Hello.\n\n                         JACK\n               Nice to see you.\n\n     FACES\n\n     Silent and staring.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     DAVID AND JACK\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (smiles)\n               It's very cold outside.  May\n               we come in?\n\n     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over\n     to a table and very self-consciously remove their\n     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the\n     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman\n     finally comes over to them.\n\n                         JACK\n               Do you have any hot soup?\n\n                         WOMAN\n               No.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Well, do you have any coffee?\n\n                         WOMAN\n               No.\n\n                         JACK\n               Hot chocolate?\n                         WOMAN\n               We've got spirits and beer.\n               If it's something hot you\n               want, you can have tea.\n\n                         JACK\n               Then you have some hot tea?\n\n                         WOMAN\n               No.\n\n                         JACK\n               Oh.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               But I can heat some up for you\n               if you'd like.\n\n                         DAVID & JACK\n               Yes, please.\n\n     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes\n     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess\n     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.\n\n                         JACK\n               Nice looking group.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Listen, at least it's warm in\n               here.\n\n                         JACK\n               Look at that.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     JACK'S P.O.V.\n\n     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed\n     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What about it?\n\n                         JACK\n               It's a five-pointed star.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Maybe the owners are from\n               Texas.\n\n     The Woman brings them their tea.\n\n                         JACK\n                    (to Woman)\n          Remember the Alamo?\n\n                         WOMAN\n               I beg your pardon?\n\n                         DAVID\n               He was joking.  Thank you.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.\n               I saw it once in London, in\n               Leicester Square.\n\n     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS\n     explains:\n\n                         CHESS PLAYER\n               She means in the cinema, that\n               film with John Wayne.\n                    (turns to board)\n               Checkmate.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Oh, yes, of course.\n\n                         JACK\n               Right, with Laurence Harvey\n               and everybody died in it.  It\n               was very bloody.\n\n                         CHESS PLAYER\n               Bloody awful if you ask me!\n\n     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.

There was this\n               airplane over the Atlantic on\n               its way to New York.  It was\n               full of men from the United\n               Nations.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               That's very funny, that is.\n\n     Uproarious laughter.\n\n                         JACK\n                    (to David)\n               Go on, ask them.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (to Jack)\n               You ask them.\n\n                         CHESS PLAYER\n               Here now, let me finish!  So\n               halfway over the ocean the\n               engines run low on petrol so\n               they have to lighten the\n               plane.  So they heave out all\n               the baggage, but it's still\n               too heavy.  So they chuck out\n               the seats, but it's still too\n               heavy!  Finally this Froggy\n               steps up and shouts \"Viva la\n               France\" and leaps out.  Then\n               an Englishman....\n\n                         DART PLAYERS\n               Hear!  Hear!\n\n                         CHESS PLAYER\n                    (undaunted)\n               ...steps up and shouts `God\n               save the Queen!' and leaps\n               out.  But the plane is still\n               too heavy.  So the Yank\n               delegate from Texas steps up,\n               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'\n               and chucks out the Mexican.\n\n     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of\n     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is\n     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the\n     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart\n     Player gasps out...\n                         DART PLAYER\n               Remember the Alamo!\n\n     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer\n     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.\n\n                         JACK\n               Excuse me, but what's that\n               star on the wall for?\n\n     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and\n     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look\n     hard indeed.\n\n                         DART PLAYER\n                    (angry)\n               You've made me miss.\n\n                         JACK\n               I'm sorry.\n\n                         DART PLAYER\n               I've never missed the board\n               before.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jack, we'd better go.\n\n                         JACK\n               What do you mean?

The gathered continue to drink, play chess\n     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Perhaps they'll be safe in the\n               rain.\n\n     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.

ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from\n     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is\n     a light drizzle.

Although after a bit of\n     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out\n     of breath.\n\n                         DAVID\n               We're lost.\n\n     Another bloodcurdling howl.\n\n                         JACK\n               Shit!

I think we should\n               just keep moving.\n\n     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the\n     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something\n     out there.  It starts to walk.\n\n                         DAVID\n               It's moving.\n\n                         JACK\n               It's circling us.\n\n     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four\n     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.\n\n                         JACK\n               Fuck.\n\n     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -\n     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It\n     sits breathing heavily.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What's the plan?\n\n                         JACK\n                    (nervously)\n               Plan?\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (not too relaxed\n                     himself)\n               Let's just keep walking.\n\n     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.\n\n                         DAVID\n               That's right, a lovely stroll\n               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,\n               isn't this fun?\n\n     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys\n     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.\n\n                         DAVID\n               It's in front of us.\n\n                         JACK\n               Do you think it's a dog?\n\n     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.\n\n     BOYS' P.O.V.\n\n     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking\n     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily\n     and its breath is visible.\n\n                         JACK\n               Oh shit.  What is that?\n\n                         DAVID\n               A sheep dog or something.\n               Turn slowly and let's walk\n               away.\n\n     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.\n\n                         JACK\n               Nice doggie.  Good boy.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Walk away, Jack.\n\n                         JACK\n               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here\n               we are walking away.\n\n     They are in a full-out run by now.

I'm glad we...WHOAA!!\n\n     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring\n     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays\n     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and\n     Jack laugh.\n\n                         JACK\n               You really scared me, you\n               shithead.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Are you going to help me up?\n\n     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when\n     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!\n\n     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.\n     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and\n     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to\n     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams\n     and the wolf's roars combine.\n\n                         JACK\n               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please\n               help me!  Please!  David!\n               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!\n\n     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     David runs and runs.

He stares in horror.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jack....\n\n     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS\n\n     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as\n     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs\n     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the\n     hulking form rolls off of him.\n\n     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n\n     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from\n     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches\n     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,\n     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying\n     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers\n     crowd around, David falls back and faints.\n\n                                                  FADE OUT\n\n\n     FADE IN\n\n11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital\n     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder\n     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.\n     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and\n     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his\n     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look\n     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls\n     out....\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jack?!\n\n     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a\n     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very\n     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Mr. Kessler?\n\n     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her\n     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Mr. Kessler?\n\n     David remains unconscious.

The girls are embarrassed.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried\n               out a minute ago.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Miss Gallagher, surely you\n               must perform some function\n               here at the hospital.\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Yes, Doctor.\n\n                         DR.

Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Can I be of service, Miss\n               Price?\n\n                         ALEX\n               Dr. Hirsch?\n\n                         DR.

HIRSCH\n               The police report said an\n               escaped lunatic attacked them.\n               He must have been a very\n               powerful man.

DENSE FOREST - DAY\n\n     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the\n     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the\n     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.

The breathing gets louder and\n     harder, then too loud when we:\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n13   INT.

No, tell\n               him I've passed away.  An old\n               war wound or something.  Tell\n               him I'm dead.

Dr. Hirsch sits observing.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm sorry if I conflict with\n               your report, but Jack and I\n               were not attacked by a man.\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n               So you've said.\n\n                         SGT. McMANUS\n               He may have a point,\n               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys\n               would be able to defend\n               themselves against one man.\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n               Sgt. McManus, are you\n               suggesting that David and Jack\n               were, in fact, attacked by\n               some animal and that the\n               officialdom of East Proctor\n               has conspired to keep it a\n               secret?  We have an autopsy\n               report on the murderer who was\n               shot in the act by the local\n               police.  We have two witnesses\n               to the crime.  You'll forgive\n               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider\n               your testimony as coming from\n               someone who has gone through a\n               terrible shock.\n\n                         SGT. McMANUS\n               Lieutenant, the boy seems\n               pretty lucid to me and....\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n               And what, Sergeant?\n\n                         SGT. McMANUS\n                    (defeated)\n               I don't rightly know, sir.\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n               That is precisely my point.\n               David, as far as we are\n               concerned, the matter is\n               closed.  We won't trouble you\n               any further.  Good day.\n\n     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles\n     at David and follows.\n\n                         LT. VILLIERS\n               Doctor.\n\n     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.\n\n                         DAVID\n               There were witnesses?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               So they said.\n\n                         DAVID\n               How could there have been\n               witnesses?  It was so dark.\n               We were running and I fell and\n               Jack went to help me up and\n               this thing came from\n               nowhere...I don't understand\n               what they're talking about.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               In time I'm sure it will all\n               come back to you.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Doctor, my memory is fine.\n               It's my sanity I'm beginning\n               to worry about.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n16   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY\n\n     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through\n     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the\n     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs\n     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.\n     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness\n     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,\n     looking about.\n\n     CLOSEUP\n\n     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his\n     animalness.\n\n     DAVID\n\n     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and\n     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with\n     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We\n     see him completely as the animal, study his movement\n     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops\n     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly\n     he pushes some leaves aside.\n\n     CLOSEUP\n\n     of his eyes.\n\n     DAVID'S P.O.V.\n\n     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and\n     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The\n     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     DAVID\n\n     Shots showing the muscles in his legs and shoulders\n     tensing.\n\n     CLOSEUP\n\n     of David's eyes.\n\n     CLOSEUP\n\n     of the frightened deer.\n\n                                                  CUT BACK\n                                                  TO:\n\n     CLOSEUP\n\n     of David's eyes.\n\n                                                  CUT BACK\n                                                  TO:\n\n     THE FAWN\n\n     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame\n     as David forces it down.  David's head reenters frame,\n     his mouth full of flesh, his face and hands covered\n     with blood.  He howls in triumph.\n\n17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door\n     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss\n     Gallagher enters with a small tray.  She crosses to\n     David, turns on the bed light and touches him.\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Mr. Kessler?  Wake up, please.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (awakened)\n               I was having a nightmare.\n\n     Miss Gallagher is very efficient in administering the\n     pills and pouring a glass of water.\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Yes, well these should help\n               that.  That's right, drink up.\n\n     David takes the pills.\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Now go back to sleep so you'll\n               be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the\n               morning.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What time is it?\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               It's nearly eight.  I'm off\n               duty shortly, then I'm off to\n               the films with Alex.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Alex?\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Miss Price, the other nurse\n               that attended you.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What are you going to see?\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               An American film about the\n               Mafia called `See You Next\n               Wednesday', and I want to see\n               it badly, so you give me no\n               problems and go to sleep.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (dropping off)\n               Do you have bad dreams, too?\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Some, everyone does.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Yes, but does everyone kill\n               Bambi?\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Bambi?\n\n     David has fallen asleep.  Miss Gallagher turns off the\n     light, picks up her tray and pauses in the doorway.\n\n                         MISS GALLAGHER\n               Kill Bambi?\n\n     She exits, closing the door plunging the room into\n     darkness.\n\n18   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - DAY\n\n     The corridor is busy with orderlies pushing gurneys\n     about, doctors, visitors, and patients all performing\n     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'\n     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,\n     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with\n     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from\n     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Miss Price.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Take these round now, will you\n               please?  The American boy in\n               twenty-one is only to have\n               these after he's eaten.  Will\n               you be sure of that?\n\n                         ALEX\n               Has he been refusing food?\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Nothing quite as dramatic as\n               that, Miss Price.  He just\n               doesn't eat enough of what is\n               put before him.  He suffers\n               from nightmares.  I'd think he\n               just needs a hand to hold.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.\n\n     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way\n     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her\n     appearance.  She enters.\n\n19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY\n\n     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.\n     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Hello, Benjamin.\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n\n                         ALEX\n               No what?\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Well, all right then, be that\n               way.  Here, swallow this.\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin\n     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,\n     handing Alex back the glass.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Feeling better?\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n\n                         ALEX\n               The doctor will be round\n               later.

Now what\n               kind of nurse would I be if I\n               failed in so simple a task as\n               giving out some pills?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Leave the pills.  I'll take\n               them later.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Sorry.\n\n     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Aw come on, Miss Price!\n\n                         ALEX\n               Call me Alex.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Aw come on, Alex!\n\n                         ALEX\n               Shall I be forced to feed you,\n               Mr. Kessler?\n\n     David is getting interested.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Call me David.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Shall I be forced to feed you,\n               David?\n\n                         DAVID\n               This is absurd.  I'm not\n               hungry.  I don't want any\n               food.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Right.\n\n     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and\n     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in\n     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David\n     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under\n     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.\n     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Let's try a little harder,\n               shall we?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Will you give me a break?\n\n     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,\n     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused\n     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds\n     up another bite.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Will I have to take such\n               drastic action again, David?\n\n     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.\n     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each\n     other up.  Finally:\n\n                         DAVID\n               May I have a glass of milk?\n\n     Alex smiles.\n\nFADE OUT\n\n     FADE IN\n\n22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY\n\n     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again\n     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He\n     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we\n     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:\n\n                         JACK (O.S.)\n               David!  David!  Please help\n               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my\n               God!\n\n     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with\n     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's\n     screams.\n\n     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming\n     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-\n     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There\n     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same\n     as David's.\n\n     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed\n     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks\n     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the\n     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches\n     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the\n     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches\n     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder\n     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The\n     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.\n     His face registers total disbelief and increasing\n     horror.\n\n     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale\n     white with purple lips and death pallor.\n\n     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.\n\n     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then\n     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.\n     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly\n     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing\n     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in\n     the....\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n23   INT. HOSPITAL NURSES' STATION - NIGHT\n\n     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls\n     out....\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!\n\n     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Orderly, go at once to twenty-\n               one and restrain the patient.\n\n     The orderly exits.\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Miss Gallagher, remain here at\n               the desk.  I'll be in twenty-\n               one.\n\n     She exits.\n\n24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY\n\n     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes\n     thoughtfully out the window.\n\n                         DR.

But never so\n               real.  Never so bizarre.\n\n     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Did you get a good look at the\n               man who attacked you?\n\n                         DAVID\n               I've told you, it wasn't a\n               man.  It was an animal.  A big\n               wolf or something.  A rabid\n               dog.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n                    (chewing on his glasses)\n               Yes.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've\n               been traumatized, but Jack was\n               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man\n               can't do that to someone with\n               his bare hands.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               You'd be surprised what\n               horrors a man is capable of.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Did you see Jack?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               No.  In fact, your wounds were\n               cleaned and dressed before you\n               arrived here.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Did you talk to the police in\n               East Proctor?  Did the cops go\n               to The Slaughtered Lamb?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               I really don't know.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Then why the hell are you so\n               quick to disbelieve me?  You\n               yourself said it must have\n               taken incredible strength to\n               tear apart a person like that.\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n                    (rubs his forehead)\n               David, please.  The police are\n               satisfied.  I'm certain that\n               if a monster were out roaming\n               northern England we'd have\n               seen it on the telly.\n\n                         DAVID\n               You really think I'm crazy,\n               don't you?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Believe me.  The Hound of the\n               Baskervilles was an invention\n               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.\n               And if you'd read the bloody\n               book, you'd find that Holmes\n               discovered your house of hell\n               a fraud, a fake.\n\n     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.\n     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Now really, David.  You're far\n               too intelligent to go on this\n               way.  When you return to\n               America I want you to seek out\n               a competent psychiatrist or\n               psychologist or something and\n               stop this nonsense.  You'll be\n               leaving this hospital in three\n               or four days, please remain\n               sane.  At least until you are\n               no longer our responsibility.\n\n     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Dr. Hirsch?\n                    (pause)\n               I'd rather not be by myself.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Of course not, David.  I'll\n               fetch in young Miss Price.\n\n                                                  DISSOLVE\n                                                  TO:\n\n25   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and\n     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.\n     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she\n     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King\n     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex\n     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.\n     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and\n     feet, fingers and toes stretch.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (quietly)\n               You're a very beautiful girl.\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (embarrassed)\n               I thought you were asleep.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I was.

KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT\n\n     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His\n     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his\n     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch \"The Muppet Show\" on\n     television.  We can see past the small dining nook\n     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen\n     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful\n     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and\n     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.\n\n                         FATHER\n               I'll get it.\n\n     The pounding continues.\n\n                         FATHER\n               All right, all right!  Hold\n               your horses.\n\n     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he\n     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine\n     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence\n     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the\n     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise\n     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,\n     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in\n     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting\n     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into\n     his chair by one of the things and held there.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Stop!\n\n     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister\n     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.\n     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the\n     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly\n     slits David's throat.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n27   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT\n\n     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying\n     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is\n     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee\n     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to\n     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides\n     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and\n     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David\n     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up\n     anyway.\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (yawns, smiles)\n               Hello.  You all right?\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm sorry I woke you up.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Don't be silly.  Can I get you\n               something?\n\n                         DAVID\n               No, thank you.  Just keep me\n               company for a while.\n\n                         ALEX\n               That's easy enough.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I keep having these really\n               terrible dreams.  They are\n               getting worse and I can't seem\n               to stop them.\n\n                         ALEX\n               David, your dreams will stop.\n               You'll leave England and your\n               bad memories; and then this\n               will all fade away.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Will you come with me?\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (taken aback)\n               What?\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (smiling)\n               I'm serious.  You don't know\n               me and I know nothing about\n               you.  We have a perfect\n               relationship.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Now, David, I said I would\n               keep you company, but I meant\n               right here and now.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Will you think about it?\n\n                         ALEX\n               How did we get from your bad\n               dreams to my taking a holiday\n               with a patient?\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (big grin)\n               Not just a patient -- me.\n\n                         ALEX\n               You're being awfully forward,\n               aren't you?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Forgive me, I'm trying to\n               cheer myself up and an affair\n               with a beautiful nurse seemed\n               like just the thing to do it.\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (smiles)\n               All I am to you is a sex\n               fantasy then?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Now I'm embarrassed.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Good.  I thought for a moment\n               I was the only embarrassed one\n               in the room.\n\n     There is an awkward pause.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Where were we in the book?\n\n     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (looking through\n                     the book)\n               Let me see here.\n\n                                                  FADE OUT\n\n\n     FADE IN\n\n28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING\n\n     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast\n     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the\n     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.\n\n                         ORDERLY\n               Ah you're up.  Good morning\n               and a good day to you.  We've\n               quite a meal for you here this\n               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,\n               orange juice, and toast with\n               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now\n               eat it up and I'll be back for\n               the dishes when you've\n               finished.\n\n     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been\n     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,\n     notices his exit.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Good morning.\n\n     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a\n     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (in mock English accent)\n               Please, sir, I want some more.\n\n     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his\n     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear\n     Jack's o.s. voice.\n\n                         JACK (O.S.)\n               Can I have a piece of toast?\n\n     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving\n     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by\n     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual\n     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him\n     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud\n     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his\n     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,\n     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he\n     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome\n     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him\n     at all.\n\n                         JACK\n                    (pleasantly)\n               Nice to see you.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (unbelieving)\n               Get the fuck out of here,\n               Jack.\n\n                         JACK\n               Thanks a lot.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (horrified)\n               This is too much.  I can't\n               handle this.\n\n                         JACK\n               I'm aware that I don't look so\n               great, but I thought you'd be\n               glad to see me.\n\n     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's\n     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat\n     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at\n     Jack horrified.\n\n                         JACK\n               David!  You're hurting my\n               feelings.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (astounded)\n               Hurting your feelings?

ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts\n     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes\n     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.\n\n39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\n     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,\n     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When\n     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine\n     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes\n     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack\n     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big\n     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to\n     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.\n     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes\n     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in\n     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing\n     in the doorway.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (points a trembling\n                     finger)\n               You're not real.\n\n                         JACK\n               Don't be an asshole, David.\n               Come here.\n\n     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living\n     room.\n\n40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM\n\n     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He\n     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not\n     to wake up Alex.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What are you doing here?\n\n                         JACK\n               I wanted to see you.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Okay, you've seen me.

HIRSCH\n               Would you like a game of\n               chess?\n\n45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY\n\n     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.\n     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has\n     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously\n     not going out.  Alex pulls away.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Let me go now, you'll make me\n               late.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Do me an enormous favor?\n\n                         ALEX\n               Anything.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Tell me that it's silly of me\n               to be apprehensive.\n\n                         ALEX\n               It's silly of you to be\n               apprehensive.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Werewolves simply do not\n               exist.\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (serious)\n               David, do you want me to stay\n               here tonight?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Yeah, I do, but go to work.\n\n     He opens the door and they both go outside.\n\n46   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - ALEX AND\n     DAVID\n\n     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Listen, if you get too\n               anxious, call me at the\n               hospital, okay?\n\n                         DAVID\n               Okay.\n\n                         ALEX\n               I've left those pills for you.\n\n                         DAVID\n               A doper werewolf.\n\n     They kiss again.\n                         ALEX\n               I'm off.  There's food in the\n               fridge.\n\n                         DAVID\n               See you later.\n\n     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands\n     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog\n     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl\n     and snarl.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (to dog)\n               What did I do?\n\n     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl\n     tugging on his leash.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Thanks a lot, dog.\n\n     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back\n     up the steps to find the door locked.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Wonderful.\n\n     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He\n     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.\n\n                         DAVID\n               An American werewolf was found\n               frozen to death today in the\n               heart of London, England.\n\n     He looks around and sees that there is a small window\n     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the\n     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,\n     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.\n\n     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on\n     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back\n     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is\n     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.\n\n                         DAVID\n               What did I do, cat?\n\n     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to\n     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David\n     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull\n     himself into the window.\n\n47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK\n\n     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny\n     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he\n     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (weakly)\n               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.\n\n     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.\n     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.\n\n48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK\n\n     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He\n     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.\n\n49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK\n\n     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring\n     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the\n     kitchen.\n\n50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK\n\n     He reopens the fridge.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm not hungry.\n\n     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.\n\n51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK\n\n     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer\n     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's\n     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David\n     switches off the television.\n\n     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers\n     and humming.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (singing)\n               `Moon River, wider than a mile\n               I'm crossing you in style,\n               Someday....'\n\n     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it\n     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,\n     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back\n     inside and we note that the front door is not\n     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and\n     looks into the mirror.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the\n               blood of an Englishman.\n\n     He goes back into the living room and paces round and\n     round the room like a caged animal.\n\n52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT\n\n     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.\n\n                         ALEX\n               How are we feeling tonight?\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n\n                         ALEX\n               No what?\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No!\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (smiling)\n               Benjamin, have you ever been\n               severely beaten about the face\n               and neck?\n\n                         BENJAMIN\n               No.\n\n                         ALEX\n               I thought not.\n\n     She tucks him in.\n\n                         ALEX\n               You sleep now and have sweet\n               dreams.\n\n                         BENJAMIN & ALEX\n               No!\n\n     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him\n     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through\n     the window.\n\n53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly\n     clutches his head in pain.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Jesus Christ!\n\n     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (screams)\n               What?  Christ!  What?\n\n     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of\n     his head.  He trembles violently.\n\n                         DAVID\n               I'm burning up!  Jesus!\n\n     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is\n     dripping wet.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (shouts out in\n                     pain and fear)\n               Jack!?  Where are you now, you\n               fucker!?!\n\n     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in\n     anguish.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Help me!  Somebody help me,\n               please!  Jack!!\n\n     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at\n     his legs.\n\n                         DAVID\n                    (pleading, whimpering)\n               I'm sorry I called you a meat\n               loaf, Jack.\n\n     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.\n     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are\n     burning him.\n     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps\n     for air.\n\n     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.\n     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his\n     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives\n     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins\n     to change.\n\n     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy\n     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,\n     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see\n     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth\n     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his\n     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before\n     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as\n     claws burst forward.\n\n     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside\n     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into\n     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the\n     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the\n     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the\n     Wolf padding off into the darkness.\n\n\n54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT\n\n     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An\n     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver\n     and the cab drives off.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Which one, Harry?\n\n                         MAN\n               Number thirty-nine, but let's\n               go `round the back.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Why?\n\n                         MAN\n               Come on, we'll give Sean a\n               scare.\n\n                         WOMAN\n               You're crazy, Harry.\n\n                         HARRY\n               Come on.\n\n     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of\n     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the\n     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and\n     quiet.\n\n55   EXT. PARK - NIGHT\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Did you hear something?\n\n                         HARRY\n               Just now?\n\n                         WOMAN\n               Yes.\n\n                         HARRY\n               No.  Here we are, Sean's is\n               the one....\n\n     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the\n     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't\n     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the\n     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and\n     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.\n\n56   INT. SEAN'S FLAT - NIGHT\n\n     Sean's wife is looking through their French windows out\n     onto the park - a middle-aged couple.\n\n                         WIFE\n               Sean, those hooligans are in\n               the park again.\n\n                         SEAN\n               Aren't you ready yet?  They'll\n               be here any minute.\n\n                         WIFE\n               Something's going on out\n               there.\n\n57   INT. HOSPITAL - NURSES' STATION - NIGHT\n\n     Miss Gallagher is helping Mrs. Hobbs dispense\n     medication into paper cups when Dr. Hirsch approaches.\n     He is still wearing his overcoat.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Is Miss Price on duty this\n               evening?\n\n                         MRS. HOBBS\n               Yes, Doctor.\n                         DR.

PARK - NIGHT\n\n     Sean has exited the back of his flat to investigate his\n     wife's complaints.  She hangs by the door.  He walks\n     deeper into the park.\n\n                         SEAN\n                    (calls out)\n               Is anyone there?\n\n59   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT\n\n     Dr. Hirsch hangs up his overcoat.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Sit down, Alex.\n\n     Alex sits and Dr. Hirsch leans against his desk.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               I was in East Proctor today.\n\n     Alex looks confused.  Dr. Hirsch realizes the cause of\n     her concern.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Oh dear girl, your\n               extracurricular activities are\n               of no consequence to me.

There are no records.\n               The case was closed and now\n               they've `misplaced' the file.\n               David's lacerations were\n               cleaned and dressed when he\n               arrived here and yet\n               supposedly no doctor examined\n               him before I did.  The Goodman\n               boy is already in the ground\n               so he's no good to us.  So I\n               went to the pub in East\n               Proctor where I was convinced\n               of two things.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Yes.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               They were lying.  There were\n               no witnesses, no escaped\n               lunatic.  The whole community\n               is hiding the truth of what\n               actually happened up there.\n\n                         ALEX\n               And what else?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               I think the village of East\n               Proctor is hiding some dark\n               and terrible secret.  I'm\n               convinced that, like David,\n               they believe in this werewolf.\n\n     Alex is flabbergasted.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               You've absolutely no idea\n               where David might be?\n\n                         ALEX\n               No.  He knows no one in\n               London, besides me.  I\n               shouldn't have left him alone.\n\n     Suddenly.\n\n                         ALEX\n               Surely you're not\n               suggesting....\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               David has suffered a severe\n               trauma.  I myself witnessed\n               some form of mass neurosis in\n               East Proctor.  If all the\n               villagers believe that Jack\n               Goodman was killed by a\n               werewolf, why shouldn't David?\n               And then it follows that if he\n               survived an attack by a\n               werewolf, wouldn't he himself\n               become a werewolf the next\n               full moon?\n\n                         ALEX\n                    (bewildered)\n               Dr. Hirsch?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Oh, I don't mean running about\n               on all fours and howling at\n               the moon.  But in such a\n               deranged state he could harm\n               himself, or perhaps others.\n\n                         ALEX\n               What shall we do?\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Let's call the police and see\n               if they can help us find our\n               wandering boy.\n\n\n63   EXT. BRICK LANE - NIGHT\n\n     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London\n     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old\n     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to\n     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its\n     ears perk up and he growls in warning.\n\n                         DERELICT #1\n               Old Winston smells something.\n\n                         DERELICT #2\n                    (calls out)\n               Who's there?\n\n     The dog begins to whine.\n\n                         DERELICT #2\n               Let `im go.\n\n     Derelict #1 unties Winston who takes off running in\n     terror.\n\n                         DERELICT #3\n               Brave dog that.\n\n                         DERELICT #1\n                    (worried)\n               Here - who's there?\n\n     An unearthly howl shatters the night.

SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT\n\n     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the\n     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the\n     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous\n     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-\n     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his\n     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a\n     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     INT.

He turns\n     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.\n     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one\n     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's\n     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly\n     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned\n     about his imagination.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S EYES\n\n     watching in the darkness.\n\n     BACK TO SCENE\n\n     Our Passenger approaches the first escalator, pauses,\n     then gets on going swiftly and silently up the moving\n     stairway.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     CLOSEUP - WOLF'S SNOUT\n\n     In profile we can see its ragged, razor-sharp fangs and\n     black tongue.

He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear\n     it.  He stops, frightened.\n\n                         PASSENGER\n               Hello?\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n\n     TUNNEL\n\n     Long and empty.\n\n     THE PASSENGER\n\n                         PASSENGER\n               Is there someone there?\n\n     We hear the Wolf's heavy breathing.

He scrambles to his feet crying out in fear.\n     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving\n     stairs, falling several times.  He sits, panting and\n     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.\n\n                                                  CUT TO:\n     WOLF'S P.O.V.\n\n     as it begins to climb the stairs.

The tiger paces in its cage and roars\n     again.  We are at:\n\n     EXT.

David wakes up slowly.  He is\n     completely naked, his body dirty, with several\n     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and\n     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks\n     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices\n     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean\n     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel\n     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his\n     eyes.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Wake me up, Alex.\n\n     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.\n     He stands up and looks around.\n\n     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle\n     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his\n     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all\n     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a\n     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.\n     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching\n     himself on a thorn.\n\n                         DAVID\n               Ouch!\n\n66   INT.

The\n     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the\n     police line.\n\n                         DR. HIRSCH\n               Alex!\n\n     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.\n\n                         ALEX\n               David?  Is it you?  Is it\n               true, David?\n\n     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the\n     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.\n\n                         ALEX\n               David?\n\n     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex\n     realizes it will kill her.\n\n                         OFFICER\n               Fire!\n\n     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on\n     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus\n     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and\n     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.\n\n                                                  FADE TO:\n\n     BLACK\n\n     END CREDITS OVER BLACK\n\n     SONG: The fifties rock version of \"Blue Moon\".\n\n\n\n                           THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Werewolf in London\nWriters : \u00a0\u00a0John Landis\nGenres : \u00a0\u00a0Comedy\u00a0\u00a0Horror\u00a0\u00a0Romance\nUser Comments\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to IMSDb\n\n\n", "scraped": "2018-03-10 20:19:19.360146"}
