MOON\n</b>\n     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the\n     song \"Moon Shadow\" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are\n     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is\n     superimposed.\n\n               An American Werewolf in London\n\n     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it\n     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the\n     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.\n\n<b>2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans\n     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a\n     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to\n     have earned their literary reputation.\n\n     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,\n     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,\n     climbs down.\n\n     \"Moon Shadow\" ends.\n\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams\n     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened\n     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both\n     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in\n     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.\n\n     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none\n     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and\n     stretch.\n\n<b>     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER\n</b>\n     They've been cramped for hours.\n\n<b>                         TRUCK DRIVER\n</b>               Here, lads, East Proctor and\n               all about are the moors.

EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT\n</b>\n     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly\n     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all\n     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a\n     very small population and the place looks empty.  David\n     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The\n     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and\n     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.\n\n<b>4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody\n     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, \"The\n     Slaughtered Lamb\".\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               The Slaughtered Lamb?\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Of course, The Slaughtered\n               Lamb.

THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The pub was apparently \"modernized\" sometime in the mid-\n     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with\n     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by\n     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older\n     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.\n     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are\n     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is\n     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about\n     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They\n     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types\n     and the general level of noise in the room.\n\n     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead\n     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at\n     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the\n     strange attention.  They give each other a \"what?\"\n     look, then turn to the assembled populace.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Hello.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Nice to see you.\n\n<b>     FACES\n</b>\n     Silent and staring.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     DAVID AND JACK\n</b>\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (smiles)\n               It's very cold outside.

The boys walk carefully over\n     to a table and very self-consciously remove their\n     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the\n     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman\n     finally comes over to them.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Do you have any hot soup?\n\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               No.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Well, do you have any coffee?\n\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               No.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Hot chocolate?\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               We've got spirits and beer.\n               If it's something hot you\n               want, you can have tea.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Then you have some hot tea?\n\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               No.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Oh.\n\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               But I can heat some up for you\n               if you'd like.\n\n<b>                         DAVID &amp; JACK\n</b>               Yes, please.\n\n     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes\n     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess\n     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Nice looking group.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Listen, at least it's warm in\n               here.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Look at that.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     JACK'S P.O.V.\n</b>\n     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed\n     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               What about it?\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               It's a five-pointed star.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Maybe the owners are from\n               Texas.\n\n     The Woman brings them their tea.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>                    (to Woman)\n          Remember the Alamo?\n\n<b>                         WOMAN\n</b>               I beg your pardon?\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               He was joking.

Finally this Froggy\n               steps up and shouts \"Viva la\n               France\" and leaps out.

He attracted me\n               by three things: his candid\n               simplicity, his marvelous\n               familiarity with ancient\n               armor, and the restfulness of\n               his company - for he did all\n               the talking.

KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT\n</b>\n     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His\n     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his\n     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch \"The Muppet Show\" on\n     television.  We can see past the small dining nook\n     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen\n     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful\n     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and\n     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.\n\n<b>                         FATHER\n</b>               I'll get it.\n\n     The pounding continues.\n\n<b>                         FATHER\n</b>               All right, all right!  Hold\n               your horses.\n\n     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he\n     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine\n     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence\n     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the\n     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise\n     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,\n     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in\n     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting\n     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into\n     his chair by one of the things and held there.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Stop!\n\n     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister\n     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.\n     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the\n     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly\n     slits David's throat.\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>27   INT.

He sees that Alex is\n     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee\n     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to\n     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides\n     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and\n     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David\n     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up\n     anyway.\n\n<b>                         ALEX\n</b>                    (yawns, smiles)\n               Hello.

He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.\n\n<b>                         ORDERLY\n</b>               Ah you're up.  Good morning\n               and a good day to you.

The drowsy David, who has been\n     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,\n     notices his exit.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Good morning.\n\n     He looks at his food none too happily.

Jack, behaving\n     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by\n     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual\n     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him\n     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud\n     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his\n     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,\n     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he\n     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome\n     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him\n     at all.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>                    (pleasantly)\n               Nice to see you.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (unbelieving)\n               Get the fuck out of here,\n               Jack.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               Thanks a lot.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (horrified)\n               This is too much.

Jack returns to his seat\n     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at\n     Jack horrified.\n\n<b>                         JACK\n</b>               David!

David stands\n     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog\n     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl\n     and snarl.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (to dog)\n               What did I do?\n\n     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl\n     tugging on his leash.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Thanks a lot, dog.\n\n     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back\n     up the steps to find the door locked.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Wonderful.\n\n     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.

The hair stands up on its arched back\n     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.

David\n     switches off the television.\n\n     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers\n     and humming.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (singing)\n               `Moon River, wider than a mile\n               I'm crossing you in style,\n               Someday....'\n\n     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it\n     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,\n     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back\n     inside and we note that the front door is not\n     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and\n     looks into the mirror.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the\n               blood of an Englishman.\n\n     He goes back into the living room and paces round and\n     round the room like a caged animal.\n\n<b>52   INT.

On all fours he gives\n     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins\n     to change.\n\n     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy\n     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,\n     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see\n     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth\n     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his\n     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before\n     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as\n     claws burst forward.\n\n     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside\n     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into\n     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the\n     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the\n     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the\n     Wolf padding off into the darkness.\n\n\n<b>54   EXT.

Before the Woman can scream, the\n     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't\n     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the\n     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and\n     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.\n\n<b>56   INT.

David grabs his head\n     suddenly.\n\n\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>83   EXT. BIG BEN - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The clock strikes eleven.  The full moon is up.\n\n<b>84   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three\n     small children, the oldest nine, stand in the aisle\n     staring at him.\n\n<b>                         DAVID\n</b>                    (gasps out in anguish)\n               Go away!

CINEMA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The\n     TICKET TAKER at the door says to the Ticket Lady:\n<b>                         TICKET TAKER\n</b>               I'll check on the house.\n\n     He goes inside the theater.\n\n<b>86   INT.

He sees something\n     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.\n\n<b>     THE WOLF SPRINGS!\n</b>\n<b>                                                  CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>87   EXT.

CINEMA - NIGHT\n</b>\n     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied\n     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the\n     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes\n     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly\n     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its\n     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,\n     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.\n     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.\n\n<b>90   EXT.

Officers are\n     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door\n     closed against the Wolf's battering.\n\n     Another police car pulls up and out steps Lt. Villiers\n     and Sgt. McManus.\n\n<b>                         LT.

It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging\n     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.\n\n     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid\n     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling\n     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders\n     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.\n\n     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops\n     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf\n     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly\n     barricade the entrance to the alley.\n\n<b>94   INT.

Is it\n               true, David?\n\n     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the\n     shadows.
