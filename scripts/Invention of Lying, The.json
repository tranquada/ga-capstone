CAVEMAN VILLAGE - THE PALEOLITHIC ERA - NIGHT\n          \n          Everyone in the village is asleep. Everyone, that is, but\n          \"loser caveman\" who sleeps uncomfortably in his tiny little\n          cave, tossing and turning, unable to get comfortable.\n          \n          A stirring in the trees causes \"loser caveman\" to sit\n          upright. There's something outside of the village. Something\n          big.\n          \n          Suddenly a GIANT TUSKED BOAR pushes through the trees and\n          stands, looking quite menacing, not ten yards from the\n          village fire.\n          \n          \"Loser caveman\" is practically shaking with fear. The boar\n          makes eye-contact with \"loser caveman\" and charges directly\n          towards his tiny little cave.\n          \n          The giant boar runs head first into the cave opening, but the\n          opening is too small for the beast to fit its head inside.\n          \"Loser caveman\" screams like a girl.\n          \n          The boar backs up to strike again -- this one sure to be the\n          end of \"loser caveman\" -- when a large boulder, knocked loose\n          by the Boar's first hit, tumbles down and lands smack on the\n          Boar's head, killing it instantly.\n          \n          The entire village runs out to see what has happened. The\n          \"Loser caveman\" stumbles out of the cave and dusts himself\n          off.\n          \n          The chief steps forward.\n          \n                              CHIEF CAVEMAN\n                    The beast!

MARK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n          \n          Mark plops into bed in his boxers. His bedroom is bland,\n          uninspired and completely furnished by the cheapest stuff\n          found in an IKEA catalogue.\n          \n          Mark flips on the TV and gets under the covers. A commercial\n          comes on TV.\n          \n          INSERT: COMMERCIAL\n          \n          A man in a suit stands next to a single can of coke resting\n          on a small table.\n          \n                              JIM\n                    Hi, I'm Jim and I'm the\n                    spokesperson for the Coca-Cola\n                    company. I'm here today to ask you\n                    to continue buying coke. I'm sure\n                    it's a drink you've been drinking\n                    for years, and if you still enjoy\n                    it, I'd like to remind you to buy\n                    it again sometime soon. It's\n                    basically just brown sugar water,\n                    we haven't changed the ingredients\n                    much lately, so there's nothing new\n                    about it I can say. We changed the\n                    can around a little bit. See, the\n                    colors here are a little different,\n                    and we even put a polar bear on it\n                    for the kids. Also, coke is very\n                    high in sugar, can lead to obesity\n                    in children and adults who don't\n                    sustain a healthy diet, and has a\n                    Ph acidity level high enough to\n                    dissolve teeth and bones over\n                    extended periods of time. Coke also\n                    works great at removing corrosion\n                    from car batteries and loosening\n                    rusted bolts. So that's it, it's\n                    coke. Everyone knows it. It's very\n                    famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,\n                    and I'm asking you to not stop\n                    buying coke. That's all.

I still know that,\n                    indeed, my eyes are brown, but no\n                    one else is aware of this fact, so\n                    therefore I have blue eyes.\n                              (MORE)\n          \n                                                                    56.\n          \n                              MARK (V.O.)

Because the world is too\n                    stupid to change. The world only\n                    cares about what they can see, and\n                    what they can know, and what\n                    they're used to and what... makes\n                    sense. No one listens to what they\n                    really want.
