I'm here today to ask you\n                    to continue buying coke. I'm sure\n                    it's a drink you've been drinking\n                    for years, and if you still enjoy\n                    it, I'd like to remind you to buy\n                    it again sometime soon. It's\n                    basically just brown sugar water,\n                    we haven't changed the ingredients\n                    much lately, so there's nothing new\n                    about it I can say. We changed the\n                    can around a little bit. See, the\n                    colors here are a little different,\n                    and we even put a polar bear on it\n                    for the kids. Also, coke is very\n                    high in sugar, can lead to obesity\n                    in children and adults who don't\n                    sustain a healthy diet, and has a\n                    Ph acidity level high enough to\n                    dissolve teeth and bones over\n                    extended periods of time. Coke also\n                    works great at removing corrosion\n                    from car batteries and loosening\n                    rusted bolts. So that's it, it's\n                    coke. Everyone knows it. It's very\n                    famous. I'm Jim, I work for coke,\n                    and I'm asking you to not stop\n                    buying coke. That's all.
