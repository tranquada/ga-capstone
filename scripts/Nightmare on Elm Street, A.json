INT.  (MONTAGE).                                                   1A.\n\n      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME begins as we FADE UP on a SERIES OF SHOTS,\n      all CLOSE and teasing.\n\n              -- A man's FEET, in shabby work shoes, stalking\n                 through a junk bin in a dark, fire-lit, ash-\n                 dusted place.  A huge BOILER ROOM is what it\n                 is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.\n                 Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,\n                 reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.\n\n              -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey\n                 WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight\n                 razor, until its fingertips are off.\n\n              -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives\n                 out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,\n                 curved, gleaming sharp.\n\n              -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's\n                 wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen\n                 his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal\n                 being assembled with crude tools, into some sort\n                 of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,\n                 against a background light of FIRE, and a deep\n                 rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.\n\n              -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.\n\n              -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.\n\n              -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like\n                 apparatus, filling it out and transforming\n                 it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with\n                 four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened\n                 fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES\n                 FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing\n                 it to shreds.\n\n\n1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.\n\n      A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed\n      RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a\n      HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from\n      within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.\n\n      CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of\n      light.\n\n                                                CUT TO:\n\n     \n2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.\n\n      TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin\n      night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her\n      steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves\n      free.\n\n      A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.\n      Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal\n      CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and\n      on into the dark.  No reason why it's there.\n\n      Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of\n      something like fingernails across slate.  It sets our teeth on\n      edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.\n\n\n3.    INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 3.\n\n      Suddenly TINA's a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam\n      pipes and catwalks -- a shadowed forest of iron and stone.  She\n      stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly\n      turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.\n\n      Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.\n\n      Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,\n      approaching TINA.\n\n      CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly\n      punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping\n      through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.\n      They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.\n\n      TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.\n\n      ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then\n      the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and\n      everything goes silent.\n\n      CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The\n      light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,\n      leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE\n      whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.\n\n                                      VOICE (O.S.)\n                      One two, Freddie's coming for\n                      you...\n\n      TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours\n      out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey\n      red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred\n      face lunges at her.  And it's his fingers that are tipped with\n      the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving\n      the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.\n\n      TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The\n      MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.\n\n      The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches\n      after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --\n\n                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n\n4.    INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      4.\n\n      TINA convulses in bed with a SCREAM, looking around wildly.\n      Someone is KNOCKING on her door.\n\n                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)\n                      You okay, Tina?\n\n      TINA'S MOTHER sticks her head in with a worried look.  TINA sits\n      up and blows out a breath, groggy.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Just a dream, Ma...\n                              (more to herself)\n                      Damn dream, is all...\n\n      The woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room.  A MAN\n      hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,\n      shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises\n      her daughter.\n\n                                      TINA'S MOTHER\n                      Some dream, judging from that.\n\n      She nods at TINA's nightshift.\n\n      TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill\n      penetrating it from the room.  There are four long slashes up its\n      middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.\n\n                                      MAN (OS)\n                              (distant, annoyed)\n                      You coming back to the sack or\n                      what?\n\n                                      TINA'S MOTHER\n                      Hold your horses.\n                              (lower, to Tina as she\n                               stands to leave)\n                      You gotta cut your nails or stop\n                      that kind of dreaming, Tina.  One\n                      or the other.\n\n      The woman shuts the door behind her.  TINA looks back to her\n      nightgown.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (low)\n                      Oh, shit.\n\n      She suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her\n      face white as her sheet.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n                                              BURN ON\n\n5.                            THE FIRST DAY                              5.\n\n                                      CHILDREN (OS)\n                              (singing)\n                      One two, Freddie's coming for you...\n                      Three four better lock your door\n                      Five six grab your crucifix...\n\n\n6.    EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL.  DAY.                                           6.\n\n      FADE UP ON SHOT OF this large highschool and its crowds of\n      STUDENTS.  FOREGROUND, TINA climbs out of a cherry-red 1959\n      Cadillac convertible with two other students, best friend NANCY\n      WILSON, and Nancy's boyfriend and owner of the car, GLEN LANTZ.\n\n      FOREGROUND several GRADESCHOOLERS are playing jump-rope, and the\n      old ditty they sing continues unbroken from TINA's bedroom.\n\n                                      ROPE JUMPERS\n                      Seven eight, gonna stay up late!\n                      Nine ten -- never sleep again!\n\n7.    MOVING ANGLE FAVORING NANCY.  She's a pretty girl in a letter      7.\n      sweater, with an easy, athletic stride and the look of a natural\n      leader.  GLEN, holding her hand, wears one of the school's\n      football jerseys; a good-natured, bright kid.  Tina's in\n      mid-conversation.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (referring to kids' song)\n                      That's what it reminded me of --\n                      that old jump rope song.\n                              (shudders)\n                      Worst nightmare I ever had.\n                      You wouldn't believe it.\n\n      Nancy nods.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Matter of fact I had a bad dream\n                      last night myself...\n\n      TINA turns to NANCY, but before either can say more, ROD LANE, a\n      lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather and New Wave studs joins\n      up with them and interupts.\n\n                                      ROD\n                              (to Tina)\n                      Had a hardon this morning when\n                      I woke up, Tina.  Had your name\n                      written all over it.\n\n      Tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      There's four letters in my name,\n                      Rod.  How could there be room\n                      on your joint for four letters?\n\n      The guy's stopped in his tracks.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn\n                      mower!\n\n      He cuts off across the lawn.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Rod says the sweetest things.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      He's nuts about you.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Yeah, nuts.\n\n      TINA makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she\n      passes.\n\n                                      TINA (CONTD)\n                              (yawns)\n                      Anyway, I'm too tired to worry\n                      about the creep.  Couldn't get\n                      back to sleep at all.\n                              (beat)\n                      So what you dream?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Forget it, the point is, every-\n                      body has nightmares once in a while.\n                      No biggy.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Next time you have one, just\n                      tell yourself that's just all\n                      it is, right while you're having\n                      it, y'know?  That's the trick.\n                      Once you do that, you wake right\n                      up.  At least it works for me.\n\n      TINA looks at GLEN sharply.  He kisses NANCY and darts off for\n      class.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Hey!  You have a nightmare too?\n\n      But GLEN's gone.\n\n                                      TINA (CONTD)\n                      Maybe we're gonna have the Big\n                      Earthquake.  They say things get\n                      weird just before that...\n\n      BELLS ARE RINGING, and STUDENTS crowding; TINA and NANCY are\n      drawn into the crush.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n8.    EXT.  A VALLEY STREET.  NIGHT.                                     8.\n\n      ANGLE ON A MODEST HOME; no car, just a couple of BIKES in the\n      drive.  Every light in the house and yard is turned on.  We HEAR\n      the rock group MADNESS played at a 'No adults home' volume.\n\n\n9.    INT.  TINA'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  9.\n\n      ON GLEN, dialing.  Nancy and TINA are watching, giggling.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      I can't believe his mother let him\n                      come over here.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Right.  Well, she didn't, exactly...\n\n      GLEN shoves a cassette into TINA's Ghetto Blaster.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                              (to TINA)\n                      See, I got this cousin who lives\n                      near the airport, that it's okay\n                      for me to stay with, right?  So I\n                      found this sound effects tape at\n                      Licorice Pizza, and...\n\n      The phone is answered.  GLEN jerks the tone arm off the record\n      with a SCRUUPT!!\n\n                                      GLEN (CONTD)\n                      Hello, Mom?\n                              (pushes the 'play' button)\n                      Yeah, out here at Barry's.\n\n      A JET PLANE begins to make itself heard on the tape.  GLEN moves\n      the machine closer to the phone.  It's a big plane -- sounds like\n      a 747 coming in for a landing.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONT)\n                      Huh?  Yeah, noisy as usual.  Glad\n                      we don't live here -- huh?  Yeah,\n                      Aunt Eunice says hello.\n\n      The Jet is SCREAMING IN now, full flaps and howling like a\n      monstrous banshee.  NANCY and TINA dissolve into muffled\n      giggles.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONT)\n                              (shouting over the din)\n                      Right, right -- I'll call you in the\n                      morning!  Right!  Huh?  Yeah, sure,\n                      I, huh?...\n\n      Suddenly the tape goes silent.  GLEN blanches.  Next moment\n      another ENGINE is heard, but this one is a FORD LOTUS screaming\n      by at 180 mph.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONT)\n                              (reacting to his mother's\n                               reaction)\n                      Uh... some kid's drag racing\n                      outside, I think...\n\n      The sound effect changes abruptly to a SPEEDING SEDAN -- and the\n      ages-old SCREECH of BRAKES, last-second SCREAM and horrible\n      COLLISION.  NANCY gamely tries to find the right button to turn\n      it off, but misses.  There's a loud SCREEK of fast-forward mayhem\n      -- Glen improvises desperately.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONT)\n                      Listen, Mom, I got to go -- I\n                      think there's been an accident out\n                      front -- I --\n\n      NANCY jumps back from the cassette player -- WORLD WAR II bursts\n      out at top volume -- MACHINE GUNS, HAND GRENADES, DIVING BEARCATS\n      and SHOUTS of charging Huns.  GLEN makes a last-ditch dive and\n      flings the cassette out of the machine.\n\n      Blessed silence at last.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONT)\n                      Right.  I'll call the police.  No,\n                      just some neighbors having a fight,\n                      I guess.  I'm fine, I'm fine!\n                      Call you in the morning!\n\n      He hangs up and sags back.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Worked like a charm.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Jesus.\n\n      TINA shoves another cassette in, and MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'THRILLER'\n      blasts from the STEREO.  The kids relax, the CAMERA GLIDES PAST\n      THEM TO THE WINDOW.\n\n      The WIND is moving the bare TREE BRANCH outside.  CAMERA PANS\n      BACK to the comfortably threadbare room, uneasy.  We see NANCY\n      poking at a flame in the hearth as TINA comes FOREGROUND to draw\n      the drapes.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Nice to have a fire.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Really.  Turn 'er up a little.\n\n      NANCY turns a nearby valve handle, and the gas fire climbs\n      brightly over its artificial log.  TINA joins her, heartened.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Maybe we should call Rod, have him\n                      come over too.  He might get jealous.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Rod and I are done.  He's too much\n                      of a maniac.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      He should join the Marines, they\n                      could make something out of him.\n                      Like a hand grenade.\n\n      TINA laughs despite herself.  NANCY brightens.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      See?  You've forgotten the bad\n                      dream.  Didn't I tell you?\n\n      TINA shakes her head, wishing she had forgotten.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      All day long I been seeing that\n                      guy's weird face, and hearing\n                      those fingernails...\n\n      NANCY looks up with a flinch.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Fingernails?\n                              (blinks, laughing)\n                      That's amazing, you saying that.\n                      It made me remember the dream I\n                      had last night.\n\n      TINA looks up.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      What you dream?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I dreamed about this guy in a\n                      dirty red and yellow sweater;\n                      I dream in color, y'know; he\n                      walked into the room I was in,\n                      right, right through the wall,\n                      like it was smoke or something,\n                      and just stared at me.  Sort of\n                      ...obscenely.  Then he walked\n                      out through the wall on the\n                      other side.  Like he'd just\n                      come to check me out...\n\n      The story has left the room deathly quiet.  Especially TINA seems\n      effected.\n\n                                     TINA\n                              (quietly)\n                      So what about the fingernails?\n\n      NANCY remembers, imitating the frightful coincidence.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      He scraped his fingernails\n                      along things -- actually, they\n                      were more like fingerknives or\n                      something, like he'd made them\n                      himself?  Anyway, they made\n                      this horrible nose --\n                              (imitates)\n                      sssssccrrrtttt....\n\n      TINA pales.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Nancy.  You dreamed about the\n                      same creep I did, Nancy...\n\n      The girls stare at each other.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      That's impossible.\n\n      They look at him.  He looks away, as if suddenly listening.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      What?\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Nothing.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      There's somebody out there,\n                      isn't there...\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I didn't hear anything...\n\n      Then there's an unmistakeable SOUND.  A distinct SCRAPING against\n      the house, just outside the window.  Something multiple, thin and\n      sharp.  Something like metal fingernails.  NANCY's mouth opens a\n      fraction of an inch.\n\n\n10.   EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                      10.\n\n      CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR as a BOLT UNLOCKS, a KEY TURNS, a CHAIN is\n      REMOVED.  At last the door swings open and GLEN swaggers out.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      I'm gonna punch out your ugly\n                      lights, whoever you are.\n\n      No answer but a slight RUSTLE in the bushes.  GLEN does a 180 and\n      walks right back inside.  The girls prod him right back out,\n      giddy with giggling fear.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      It's just a stupid cat.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Then bring us back its tail\n                      and whiskers.\n\n      The girls push him farther.  GLEN edges towards the shadows.\n      Then the SCRITCHING again.  GLEN stops; TINA edges back into the\n      house.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Anyway, I don't have a cat...\n\n      ANGLE INTO THE SHADOWS.  Turned from the girls, GLEN sobers,\n      listening.  IN HIS POV we see the street.  Silent houses.\n      Motionless trees on empty lawns.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Kitty-kitty?  Chow chow chow?\n\n      Not a living, or dead, soul.  GLEN turns back to the girls with a\n      shrug.  Instantly, a large FIGURE pounces and throws him to the\n      ground with a shout.\n\n      The girls SCREAM in panic and run for the house.\n\n11.   REVERSE -- ROD leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster --          11.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      And it's number thirty-six, Rod\n                      Lane, bringing Lantz down just\n                      three yards from the goal with a\n                      brilliant tackle!  And the fans\n                      go wild!\n\n      ROD dances into the light, flashing a wild gypsy's grin at TINA.\n      The girl's relieved and frightened at the same time.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      What the hell you doing here?\n\n                                      ROD\n                      Came to make up, no big deal.\n                      Your ma home?\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Of course.  What's that?\n\n      ROD takes the spindly hand rake he's found and scraps the house's\n      wall.  It makes a terrible SCRIIITCHING SOUND.  He grins and\n      tosses it aside.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      Intense, huh?\n                              (sizes up the three)\n                      So what's happening, an orgy or\n                      something?\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Maybe a funeral, you dickhead.\n\n      ROD wheels, a knife suddenly in his hand, as if ready to take\n      Glen's throat out.  NANCY breaks between --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      -- Just a sleep-over date, Rod.\n                      Just Tina and me.

The streetlight throws the narrow bed\n      into broken shadow and light.  TINA AND ROD lie in each other's\n      arms in the middle of the big bed.  Satiated.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      I knew there was sometihng\n                      about you I liked...\n\n      ROD yawns into the pillows, happy.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      You feel better now, right?\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Jungle man fix Jane.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      No more fights?\n\n                                      TINA\n                      No more fights.\n\n                                      ROD\n                              (sleepily)\n                      Good.  No more nightmares for\n                      either of us then.\n\n      He pulls the covers over his head.  He's almost out already.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (beat)\n                      When did you have a nightmare?\n\n                                      ROD\n                              (under the blankets)\n                      Guys can have nightmares too,\n                      y'know.  You ain't got a corner\n                      on the fucking market or something.\n\n      He rolls over, practically snoring, and pulls another cover over\n      his head.  A dirty red and yellow cover.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (sleepily)\n                      Where'd you get this snotty old\n                      thing?\n\n      SNORES from ROD.  TINA yawns, turns off the light and snuggles\n      against ROD, pulling the cover gingerly over herself, too.\n\n\n15.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT                                       15.\n\n      CAMERA MOVES across the room of the original nightmare to find\n      NANCY alone in TINA's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above\n      the bed.  Thinking.  We can just hear her HEART beating.  She\n      sighs and turns on her side.\n\n      Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,\n      with a broad yellow smear across its center.  All unseen by\n      NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's\n      beat.\n\n      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She closes her eyes.\n\n      ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD.  SOMETHING\n      presses against the surface from the inside.  The plaster buldges\n      out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing\n      pressing from inside -- taking the shape of a man's face.  The\n      face opens its mouth.  The knives rake through the surface.\n\n      ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.\n\n      She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright.  The face retracts\n      suddenly -- the wall is normal.\n\n      ANGLE DOWN ON NANCY as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her\n      hair and feeling the plaster dust.\n\n      REVERSE IN HER POV TO THE CEILING.  There are three parallel cuts\n      in the plaster there.  About eight inches long.  As if cut by\n      sharp knives.  Nothing else.\n\n      Back on NANCY.  She draws the covers around her and shivers.\n      Eyes wide open.\n\n\n16.   EXT.  TINA'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                        16.\n\n      Not a car or person in sight.  A stricken breeze dies in the\n      trees.\n\n17.   ZOOM IN on the window of the room where TINA sleeps.  By the time  17.\n      we're FULL IN CLOSE on it, the air is again still as death.  A\n      moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.  The NIGHTMARE THEME\n      appears in the lower registers and holds its breath.\n\n      Another PEBBLE strikes, with a sharper RAP.\n\n\n18.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             18.\n\n      CLOSE ON TINA'S FACE as her eyes open.\n\n19.   REVERSE IN HER POV.  Another PEBBLE clatters off the glass.        19.\n\n20.   TINA raises slowly.                                                20.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      ROD...\n\n      SNORES FROM ROD.  TINA sits up.\n\n      PAST HER TO THE WINDOW.  The WIND MOVES AGAIN; the trees brush\n      the window with their shadows.  Then another pebble.  RAP!  TINA\n      slips to the window.\n\n\n21.   EXT.  TINA'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT.                                     21.\n\n      She looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees\n      rattling in the Santa Ana winds.  It seems deserted, though the\n      welling dark won't let her be sure.  Then another pebble -- PAP!\n\n      -- hitting with a sharp RACK FOCUS.\n\n22.   A LOW ANGLE TO WINDOW as TINA jumps back, startled.  She hadn't    22.\n      seen that one coming.  But she's drawn back to the glass out of\n      curiousity, straining to see in the dark.  It's as if the stones\n      are materializing out of thin air.\n\n\n23.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                23.\n\n      WHAP!  This time a heavier stone, and a thin crack bristles\n      across the glass.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (low)\n                      Who the fuck you think you are,\n                      whoever you are?\n\n\n24.   EXT.  TINA'S BACK YARD.  NIGHT.                                    24.\n\n      WIDE ANGLE ON THE REAR OF THE HOUSE.  A LIGHT COMES ON.  TINA\n      appears in the doorway.\n\n                                      TINA\n                              (listening)\n                      Somebody there?\n\n      She can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back\n      alley.  No one there.  But a word is spoken, as if by wind.\n\n                                      VOICE\n                              (garbled)\n                      Tina.\n\n      TINA straightens, unable to swallow.  There's a ragged, obscene\n      GIGGLE.  Deep in the throat.  Phlegmy.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Who the hell is that?\n\n      TINA charges across the yard and through the gate, the MUSIC\n      chasing after.\n\n\n25.   EXT.  A SERVICE ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                     25.\n\n      She brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around.\n      Listening.  Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.\n\n      A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of\n      an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals\n      noisily down.\n\n26.   LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.  Despite herself she comes over    26.\n      and touches it.  She comes up with long worms on her fingers.\n\n      Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare\n      staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into\n      the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The\n      MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his\n      right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the\n      steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt\n      out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the\n      alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!\n\n      CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and\n      closer.  She begins to shake uncontrollably.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Oh, shit, please God...\n\n                                      KILLER\n                              (softly, approaching)\n                      This is God...\n\n      He holds up his steel-tipped hand like a surgical-steel spider.\n      TINA runs for her life.\n\n27.   WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27.\n      between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance\n      between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans\n      -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a\n      window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and\n      disappear in fright.\n\n\n28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.  NIGHT.                                       28.\n\n      TINA runs out onto front lawns, SCREAMING for help.  No help\n      comes.  In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on\n      the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree\n      -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!\n      TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be\n      trapped against its locked front door.\n\n      She hammers against its thick wood.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Nancy!  Open the door -- Nancy!\n\n      The MAN slows.  He has TINA now and knows it.\n\n                                      MAN\n                      She's still awake.  Nancy can't\n                      hear you.\n\n      TINA turns and looks full at the approaching MAN.  Smudged by\n      deep shadow, he's big and hideous.  He wears the same dirty\n      yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging\n      and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin\n      over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel\n      talons.\n\n29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29.\n      finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.  Then\n      another.  We SEE the PIECES OF FINGERS fall past TINA'S face in\n      SLOW MOTION.\n\n      ANGLE ON THE GROUND of the FINGERS squirming on the ground, one\n      flopping onto TINA's naked foot.\n\n      TINA leaps back, sickened, and begins stamping on then as if they\n      were huge bugs.\n\n      The MAN snaps up his arm and the FINGERS fly back into place on\n      his hand.  He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,\n      sweeping with his cutting hand!\n\n      TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,\n      and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  But the face\n      only slides off to the bone.  The MAN presses in, and TINA\n      contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --\n      cutting her deeply.\n\n29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A.\n      caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists\n      away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!\n      The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling\n      -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --\n      and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until\n      they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.\n\n\n30.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      30.\n\n      ROD lurches up into CLOSE UP in the lightless bedroom,\n      half-awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere, somehow\n      inside the dark bed.  ROD grabs groggily, lifting the blanket.\n\n30A.  IN HIS POV we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket -- see     30A.\n      TWO SHADOWY FIGURES flailing and clawing under the bedspread --\n      TINA and the MAN -- or a shape that could be a man -- raging\n      against each other.\n\n      ROD drops the blanket and leaps from the bed, scared full awake\n      and terrified.  Then the horrible TINA's GASPS change to the\n      CRIES of a terribly wounded victim.  ROD instantly jerks back the\n      bedspread.\n\n      IN HIS POV we SEE TINA struggling and flailing along on the\n      sheets, the MAN nowhere in sight.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      T-tina!?\n\n      Suddenly TINA -- eyes turned inward to her tormentor -- give an\n      awful jolt -- her arms and legs are spraddled as if by\n      overwhelming force and pinned to the bed.  Next instant, her\n      nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her\n      torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood\n      floods the bed.\n\n      Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment\n      something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and\n      bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into\n      the light -- smashing it to bits.\n\n31.   CLOSER ON HIM as he struggles around.  In the blue FLASHES OF      31.\n      ELECTRICITY ROD sees TINA sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark\n      smear, dragged feet first!\n\n      ANGLE ON ROD -- paralized by terror!\n\n      ANGLE ON TINA'S DYING EYES -- moving with her up the wall and\n      bumping around the corner onto the ceiling.  She's just looking\n      at who's dragging her, eyes glazing.\n\n      REVERSE IN HER POV -- to the shadowy, horrendously ugly MAN,\n      dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling, literally\n      swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body.  SEEN in FORCED\n      PERSPECTIVE, the SHOT carries her across a great distance without\n      seeming to get anywhere -- as if the ceiling is an endless\n      plane.\n\n      ANGLE DOWN ON ROD -- on his hands and knees -- the lamp next to\n      him blurting blue SPARKS and STROBING the nightmare room.  ROD'S\n      screaming up at TINA'S invisible tormentor.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      What the hell's going ON here!\n                      Tina!\n\n      ANGLE ON TINA -- upside down, clawing at the hanging swag lamp\n      above her mother's dressing table -- desperate for some anchor.\n      But she's dragged away from it.  The lamp swings back, it's wires\n      gushing more SPARKS.\n\n      CLOSER along the ceiling as TINA rakes a long furrow in the\n      ceiling with her fingernails.  But her eyes are glazing,\n      glazing.  And then they fall closed.\n\n      WIDE, UP ON THE CEILING, as her body suddenly flops loose,\n      hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed.\n\n      REVERSE ON ROD -- staring like a terrified child.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      Tina --\n\n      REVERSE IN HIS POV -- as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto\n      the devastated bed, in SLOW MOTION, striking with a huge splash\n      of blood.  A sick, awful GIGGLE floats around the room, then\n      ECHOES off into infinity.  ROD staggers up, staring around as if\n      hoping to see this phantom.\n\n                                      ROD\n                      You motherfucker!  I'll kill you\n                      for that!\n\n\n32.   INT.  TINA'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                      32.\n\n      NANCY is sitting straight up in bed, terrified.  The CRIES of ROD\n      are ringing through the whole house.  She forces herself to move\n      -- bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread.\n\n\n33.   INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             33.\n\n      NANCY flies into the dark hall -- crashing directly into SOMEONE\n      who lurches out of the dark before her.  She SCREAMS and jumps\n      back --\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      What the hell's going on!?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Oh -- jeez -- Glen!  Rod's\n                      gone ape!\n\n                                      ROD (OS)\n                              (sobbing)\n                      I'll kill you!\n\n      NANCY grabs the door; it's locked; she pounds on it.  BAM! BAM!\n      BAM!\n\n      Things fall into sudden, awful silence on the other side.  GLEN's\n      voice cracks with fear.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Rod?\n                              (silence)\n                      Rod, you better not hurt Tina...\n\n      ROD erupts into terrible HOARSE LAUGHTER AND SOBBING.  Then they\n      hear BREAKING GLASS.\n\n      GLEN barrels into the door like the football player he is.  The\n      frame splinters and they're in.\n\n\n34.   INT.  TINA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                             34.\n\n      Just inside the door NANCY slips and goes down hard.  GLEN finds\n      her in the dark more by touch than sight.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      You okay?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Yeah.  Something slippering all\n                      over here...\n                              (feeling)\n                      Tina?\n\n      No answer.  The room is quiet as a tomb.  Except for a stead\n      DRIPPING, from all over.  Then GLEN finds a LIGHT SWITCH.\n\n      On the CLICK the devastation is revealed.  There's BLOOD\n      everywhere: up the walls, over the clawed ceiling, soaking the\n      killing floor of the bed, and pooling in the dark red puddle\n      where NANCY has slipped and fallen.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Oh, shit...\n\n      NANCY wobbles up and sees TINA in the center of the ravaged bed.\n      Unmistakeably and utterly dead.

The boy jerks around.  NANCY's father, his .38 leveled right at    42.\n      ROD's belly, eases out of the bushes.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Now just step away from her, son.\n                      Like your ass depended on it.\n                      I'm warning you.\n\n      ROD backs away, looking once at NANCY with a look of terrible\n      sadness.  Then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell.\n\n      THOMPSON snaps his revolver to fire -- but instinctively NANCY\n      jumps between --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      No!\n\n      THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air, furious.\n\n                                      THOMPSON\n                      Jesus -- are you crazy!?\n\n      He plunges past the girl.\n\n\n42A.  EXT.  STREET.  DAY.                                                42A.\n\n      ROD races like a frightened animal across the lawns -- but is\n      soon cut off by the PLANECLOTHESMAN NANCY saw watching her before\n      -- and then TWO UNIFORMED POLICEMAN, who close from another\n      angle.  The chase is short and pitifully off-balance, and ROD is\n      soon wrestled to the ground.  Next moment one of the cops is\n      holding ROD'S knife into the air for THOMPSON to see.  THOMPSON\n      looks at NANCY, as if to say 'I told you.' Background, ROD'S\n      SHOUTS can be heard as he's shoved into a SQUAD CAR.\n\n                                      ROD (O.S.)\n                      I didn't do it -- !\n                              (fading)\n                      I didn't kill her, Nancy!\n\n      The car's door slams and ROD is gone.  NANCY turns to her father,\n      livid.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      You used me, daddy!\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                              (exasperated)\n                      What the hell you doing going to\n                      school today, anyway -- your\n                      mother told me you didn't even\n                      sleep last night!\n\n      NANCY spins angrily and walks away.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Nancy!

DAY.                                             43.\n\n      FADE UP ON an ENGLISH TEACHER and CLASS, NANCY among the kids,\n      trying to concentrate.\n\n                                      TEACHER\n                      According to Shakespeare, there\n                      was something operating in Nature,\n                      perhaps inside human nature itself,\n                      that was rotten -- a canker, as\n                      he put it.\n\n      The TEACHER'S eyes glance across the room.  ANGLE ON NANCY;\n      yawning but listening.\n\n                                      TEACHER (CONTD)\n                      Of course Hamlet's response to\n                      this, and to his mother's lies,\n                      was to continually probe and\n                      dig -- just like the gravediggers --\n                      always trying to get beneath the\n                      surface.  The same was true in a\n                      different way in Julius Caesar.\n                      Jon, go ahead...\n\n      She nods to a SURFER who's been waiting uncomfortably in front of\n      the class.  He squints at his book and begins, the recitation a\n      struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the\n      Bard.\n\n                                      SURFER\n                              (reading aloud)\n                      Uh, In the most high and palmy\n                      state of Rome...\n\n                                      WISEGUY STUDENT (O.S.)\n                      California's the most high and\n                      palmy state, man.\n\n      The SURFER halts with a grin; KIDS snicker.\n\n                                      ENGLISH TEACHER\n                      Can it.\n\n      She glares them back into silence.  The SURFER starts over, as we\n      CUT TO NANCY.\n\n      She's nodding off now, barely able to keep her eyes open in the\n      warm, close boredom of the classroom.\n\n                                      SURFER (O.S.)\n                      In the most high and palmy state\n                      of Rome, a little ere the mightiest\n                      Julius fell...\n                              (NANCY's head pitches\n                               forward; she jerks it\n                               back up, barely awake)\n                      The graves stood tenantless, and\n                      the sheeted dead did squeak and\n                      gibber in the Roman street...\n\n44.   NANCY's head has sunk again, eyelids drawn as if by enormous       44.\n      weight.  By the time her cheek's against the desk, the SURFER'S\n      VOICE is ECHOED and DISTANT.  But another voice, TINA'S, is very\n      near, very much present.  A sad, thin plaint.\n\n                                      TINA (O.S.)\n                      Nancy.\n\n      NANCY gives a start.  Her eyes lock onto something.\n\n45.   REVERSE.  TILTED SIDEWAYS, IN HER HEAD'S POV, we look straight     45.\n      out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall.\n      There, standing in a black pool of fluid, is a full-sized rubber\n      body bag.  Dark red and yellow.  Weaving slightly, the merest\n      suggesting of movement within it.\n\n46.   BACK ON NANCY, sitting upright, wiping the sleep from her eyes,    46.\n      shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter.  She looks back out\n      the door.\n\n47.   REVERSE IN 'NORMAL' POV -- the hallway is empty.  But there's a    47.\n      dark smear on its floor tiles.\n\n48.   NANCY looks nervously towards the rest of the class.  No one else  48.\n      has noticed a thing outside the door.  All are dumbly spellbound\n      by the SURFER, who now recites like a deep-voiced robot, his face\n      wreathed by white hair.\n\n                                      SURFER\n                      O God, I could be bounded in a\n                      nutshell and count myself a king\n                      of infinite space, were it not\n                      that I have bad dreams...\n\n49.   ANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She slips from her seat, eye warily on the   49.\n      teacher and class.  But no one turns as she disappears through\n      the doorway.\n\n\n50.   INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY.  DAY.                                        50.\n\n      NANCY turns and looks both directions.  No sign of anybody.\n\n                                      TINA (O.S.)\n                              (distant)\n                      Nancy.\n\n      NANCY wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end\n      of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime.  A pale\n      hand thrusts out of it.  A moment later, as if pulled by\n      invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an\n      intersecting corridor.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Tina!\n\n      NANCY starts running for it.\n\n51.   ANGLE AT THE CORNER as NANCY races blindly around the turn and     51.\n      smashes straight into a BODY lunging at her from the opposite\n      direction!  Both go down.\n\n52.   ANGLE AT THE FLOOR.  A dazed freshman HALLGUARD cranks herself up  52.\n      on one elbow.  She wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow\n      sweater that reads 'Hall Guard'.  Her nose is bleeding from the\n      impact.\n\n                                      HALLGUARD\n                      Y-you're not supposed to run.\n                      W-where's your pass -- you got a\n                      pass?\n\n      NANCY leaps up --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Screw your stupid pass!\n\n53.   She turns -- sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower  53.\n      hall, upright again.  But just as she sees it, it tips and\n      pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten\n      tree finally timbering down.  She can hear the sickening\n      CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.\n\n      NANCY runs for it again.  The HALLGUARD staggers up FOREGROUND,\n      bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.\n\n                                      HALLGUARD\n                      Hey, no running in the halls!\n\n      The HALLGUARD raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long\n      metal spikes.\n\n      REVERSE ANGLE AT THE DOOR as NANCY runs up.  NANCY turns to check\n      out the HALLGUARD.  She's vanished.  NANCY turns and looks down\n      through the open door.  The MUSIC sweeps through a strange,\n      brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the NIGHTMARE\n      THEME.\n\n\n54.   INT.  A STAIRWELL.                                                 54.\n\n      NANCY edges into the stairwell and looks down.  Looks like\n      there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange\n      light dances.  But there's only a low WHITE NOISE.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Tina?\n\n      No answer.  NANCY starts down the stairs.\n\n\n55.   INT.  BOILER ROOM.  DAY.                                           55.\n\n      NANCY comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room.  The smear\n      trail is there.  It runs behind a cracking, red-hot boiler the\n      size of a diesel locomotive.  Everything about the place feels\n      dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME\n      when it pauses.\n\n      TIGHT ON NANCY.  Slow terror moves into her face.  There's a low,\n      sinister GIGGLE.\n\n56.   REVERSE IN HER POV -- we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the   56.\n      tainted fire of the huge boiler.  Then from behind this, deeply\n      shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER.  The same\n      filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted\n      face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides\n      the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends\n      of his bony fingers.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Who are you?\n\n                                      MAN\n                      Gonna get you.\n\n57.   The leering MAN brings the bloodied scalpel-fingernails across     57.\n      his own chest, splitting a nipple.  Yellow fluid pours out.\n      MAGGOTS and WORMS.\n\n      NANCY forgets the question -- jerks around and flees in blind\n      panic into the first opening she sees -- a dark pipe tunnel.\n\n\n58.   INT.  PIPE TUNNEL.                                                 58.\n\n      ANGLE IN THE NARROW PASSAGEWAY.  In the BACKGROUND the killer\n      shambles towards her; FOREGROUND NANCY breaks into a run.\n\n      The killer sprints -- NANCY tears ahead into darkness.\n\n      She flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming,\n      SIZZLING pipes, squeezing through smaller and smaller openings.\n      The killer is just yards behind her, and soon she's trapped, just\n      as TINA was before her.\n\n      She presses her back to the wet bricks.  There's no hope of\n      fighting him off, for NANCY is not as strong as TINA.  But she is\n      smart as hell, and thinking even in this nightmare.  So by the\n      time the creep has raised his knives to strike, NANCY has\n      realized something.  She wheels and shoves her arm against one of\n      the scalding steam pipes.  In the sme split second we HEAR her\n      flesh scald, we\n\n                                                      CUT TO:\n\n\n59.   INT.  ENGLISH CLASS.  DAY.                                         59.\n\n      NANCY lurches up SCREAMING, arm raised to ward off the invisible\n      blow, books clattering to the floor -- other GIRLS nearby SCREAM\n      in surprise as she stumbles over them.  Then she stops, confused\n      and groggy from the nightmare.\n\n      WIDER ANGLE.  EVERYBODY is staring at NANCY as if she's gone\n      mad.  The ENGLISH TEACHER rushes over, herself frightened by the\n      terror in the girl's eyes.\n\n                                      TEACHER\n                      Okay -- Okay, Thompson!  Every-\n                      thing's all right now -- Nancy!.\n\n60.   NANCY jerks around with panicked eyes, expecting the killer to     60.\n      leap from any direction.  But there's only the sea of staring\n      eyes.\n\n      NANCY begins methodically picking up her books.\n\n                                      TEACHER\n                      I'll call your mother.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      No!  No, really, I'm fine.  I'll go\n                      straight home.  I'm okay.\n\n      She marches for the door.\n\n                                      TEACHER\n                      You'll need a hall pass!\n\n      But the girl's gone.\n\n\n61.   EXT.  THE SCHOOL.  DAY.                                            61.\n\n      NANCY walks out of the building, shaken.  Then she pauses at one\n      of the big pine trees out front, stops and rests her head against\n      its bark, teeth set.  NANCY starts to shake, and next second\n      she's sobbing like a broken-hearted, frightened child.        OMIT 61A.\nOMIT 61A.\n62.   But she shakes herself silent.  Wipes the tears away with a slash  62.\n      of sleeve.  She rubs her arm absently, lost in thought, then\n      reacts in surprise and pain.  She lifts her arm and stares at the\n      spot she's touched.\n\n      INSERT ON HER ARM and the BURN there; about the size and shape of\n      a half-dollar.\n\n      WIDER ON NANCY.

Neither she\n      nor her daughter has touched the food.  But MARGE is well into a\n      bottle of gin; her appetite for that is growing, right along with\n      her dread.

The water in the tub is opaque with suds.\n      Luxurious.\n\n      CLOSER ANGLE, AT WATER LEVEL ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop.  She\n      slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth\n      her nerves.  Her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing\n      deepens.\n\n      REVERSE, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of\n      the tub.  There's a ripple in the water between.  Then something\n      tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them.  It pops up with\n      a slithering MUSIC CUE and catches a sliver of light.  Then it\n      begins to rise.\n\n      Higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two\n      more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark\n      hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil\n      sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a\n      bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the\n      girl's belly.  The hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.\n\n                                      MARGE (OS/APPROACHING)\n                      Nancy?\n\n      MARGE raps on the door.

And yet she somehow flails and\n      gasps and struggles back towards the surface, managing by pure\n      panic to break the surface with her hands!\n\n\n68B.  INT.

Her mother's\n      VOICE booms over her, ECHOED and frantic -- and the loud BANGING\n      on the door finally opens her eyes.  She turns and calls gasping\n      to her mother --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Mommy!\n\n      REVERSE ON THE DOOR -- as MARGE, using the old hangar through the\n      doorhandle truck, makes it into the room.  She rushes across to\n      the tub.  NANCY is staggering up in the bathwater, again with\n      solid porcelain beneath her feet.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I told you!

NANCY looks like\n      she's likes paralized with some sort of weird dread.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      You okay?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Great\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (not believing it for\n                               a minute)\n                      To bed with you, c'mon.\n\n      MARGE rushes out to get the room ready.

NANCY closes the door, leans against\n      it and spits the pill into her hand.  She tosses it straight out\n      her window and takes a NoDoz.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n73.

She shakes herself violently and sits up\n      straighter, forcing herself to concentrate on the movie.\n\n75A.  ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN.  A DIVER struggles to keep facing a      75A.\n      large circling shark.\n\n75B.  ON NANCY.  Her eyes droop shut -- then she jerks awake, rattling   75B.\n      her head as if it were a radio drifting off station.  She tumbles\n      out of bed, throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the\n      cool night air.\n\n\n76.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND STREET.  NIGHT.                            76.\n\n      HIGH ANGLE, AT SECOND-STORY LEVEL.  NANCY looks directly across\n      the street to a lighted, open window.  Its curtains, sucked out\n      and waving in the night breeze, give the only motion to the\n      deserted street.\n\n      Then someone pitches out of the dark at her.  NANCY gives a YELP\n      -- then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes GLEN,\n      balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Sorry!

NIGHT.                                        76A.\n\n      NANCY looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasn't\n      heard.  GLEN's already through her window and planted on her\n      bed.  NANCY points to a chair.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      If you don't mind.\n\n      GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      So.  I heard you freaked out\n                      in English class today.\n\n      There's no maliciousness in his voice, and the familiar frankness\n      is actually comforting to NANCY.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Guess I did.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Haven't slept, have you?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Not really.\n\n      NANCY tries to smile, but can't fake it very well.

Nancy takes a deep breath.  Then without another word turns off    77.\n      the TV and the light.\n\n                                      GLEN (IN DARK)\n                      Jesus, it's dark in here.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Shhh.  Now listen, here's what\n                      we're gonna do...\n\n\n78.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          78.\n\n      FADE UP ON NANCY, still in her pajamas, walking through the\n      shadowy streets near her home, listening for the slightest\n      sound.  We MOVE with her.  But nothing, not even the dog barking\n      earlier, is there now.  NANCY peers into the darkness of lawns\n      and trees behind her.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (stage whisper)\n                      You still there?\n\n      Across the street and a distance away, GLEN steps from behind a\n      tree.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Yeah.  So?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Just checking -- keep out of\n                      sight!\n\n      GLEN throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of\n      sight.  NANCY turns and looks down between the houses, deep into\n      a dark alleyway.  Then she forces herself to walk into it.\n\n\n79.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               79.\n\n      MOVING WITH HER as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into\n      shadows.  Each time she pauses and waits, the MUSIC grows more\n      threatening and expectant.  The feeling is of immense tension --\n      we're sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any\n      second.\n\n      But he doesn't.  In fact absolutely nothing happens, and NANCY\n      emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed.  The only thing\n      strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to\n\n\n80.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      80.\n\n      The Police Station.  It takes her a little by surprise, it just\n      seems to have appeared.\n\n      MUSIC creeps into the NIGHTMARE THEME as NANCY whispers hoarsely\n      back down the dark alley.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Still there?\n\n\n81.   EXT.  ALLEY.  NIGHT.                                               81.\n\n      We only HEAR the DISTANT VOICE, slightly ECHOED.\n\n                                      GLEN'S VOICE (OS)\n                              (yawning)\n                      Still here!\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      On your toes, right?\n\n      NANCY stares into the dark trying to see him, but she can't.  She\n      turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight.\n\n\n82.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      82.\n\n      MUSIC MOUNTS as we MOVE WITH NANCY across the lawns to the police\n      station, creeping to the first lighted window she sees.  It's a\n      low, barred basement window, and NANCY reacts as soon as she\n      looks through it.\n\n\n83.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          83.\n\n      NANCY'S POV down into ROD LANE's cell.  The boy is on his rough\n      cot, twitching in disturbed sleep.  And a long SHADOW is sliding\n      across the wall.\n\n      A big SHAPE appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boy's\n      cell, and as IT walks closer NANCY can barely see it's the\n      shambling, grimly scarred man with the filthy red and yellow\n      sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow.  The\n      KILLER from all of their nightmares.\n\n      And this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the\n      cell, like so much evil Jello.  Halfway through he pauses,\n      turning to check over his shoulder.  We see the bars clearly\n      penetrating his body, going in his head, passing out his ankles.\n      Then he turns back to ROD and moves forward, and within another\n      heartbeat is beside the boy.\n\n\n84.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      84.\n\n      NANCY draws back sharply, swallowing in terror.  She looks behind\n      her for help.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Glen.\n\n      No answer.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                              (louder)\n                      Glen?!\n\n      The street is absolutely deserted.  There is no motion, and no\n      sound save one: the distant but unmistakeable sound of GLEN\n      SNORING.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      GLEN!\n\n      A beat of silence after the shout's echoes die, then the steady,\n      boyish SNORES again.  NANCY swears under her breath and jerks\n      back around, forcing herself to look again into ROD's cell.\n\n\n85.   INT.  ROD'S CELL.                                                  85.\n\n      IN HER POV -- the killer picks up ROD's bedsheet and tests it\n      between his powerful hands.  Without thinking, NANCY bangs\n      against the glass.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Rod!  Look out!\n\n      The KILLER wheels around, locking eyes with NANCY.  The girl goes\n      white.  The man's face is in the light, and it's horrible --\n      seething with hatred and a twisted, insane intelligence.\n\n      The hold of those eyes is only broken when ROD rolls up on an\n      elbow with a deep, troubled GROAN.  The instant ROD does this,\n      the KILLER fades into the shadows in the cell.  But even then his\n      eyes hold on NANCY's until the last second he's visible.\n\n      ROD looks around the cell groggily, runs his fingers through his\n      matted hair, then collapses back on his pillow.  No matter how\n      hard NANCY screams, ROD never once looks at the window.  He just\n      pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once\n      more to sleep.\n\n\tAnd now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed.  The KILLER,\n      materializing out of the shadow again, is holding it between his\n      hands like a garrote.  He looks up and leers at NANCY, then moves\n      for ROD.\n\n\n86.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      86.\n\n\tANGLE BACK ON NANCY.  She pounds on the window, then turns in\n      frustration and yells into the night.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen!!\n\n      She turns back to the cell in desperation.\n\n\n87.

POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      89.\n\n\tNANCY pulls back from the window, stunned.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I swear...\n\n      Suddenly NANCY feels utterly exposed.  She shivers, chilled and\n      vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes.  She can't\n      move.  It's as if some great nerve between her instincts and body\n      had been severed.  And she hears the SOUND behind her.  A sort of\n      filling-vibrating Scrriiitchh.\n\n      MUSIC sneaks in -- the unmistakeable NIGHTMARE THEME, creeping\n      over her.  NANCY forces herself, by sheer will, to look.\n\n90.   Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90.\n      plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is\n      TINA.  Standing square in the middle of the street.  A dark ooze\n      of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper\n      CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.  She\n      gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some\n      desperate message.\n\n      The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.\n\n91.   NANCY backs away, eyes streaming tears.                            91.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen, where are you!  Wake up!\n                      Glen!\n\n                                      DEEP RAGGED VOICE\n                      I'm here.\n\n      NANCY twists around in horror at the same instant the KILLER\n      grabs for her face with his knife-fingers!  The girl\n      intinctively pitches back, then scrambles up and runs like\n      hell!\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen!  Glen!!!\n\n\n92.   EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          92.\n\n      MOVING WITH NANCY at full gallop, running blind.  She crashes\n      through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk, sinking into the wet\n      cement over her ankles.  The stuff sticks to her legs in long\n      gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose.\n\n      The KILLER looms nearby,\n      mocking her -- his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight.  He\n      just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again, now so\n      winded she can only stagger.\n\n      MOVING WITH THEM.  Time after time NANCY just barely manages to\n      elude the shadowy form, leaping from his reach by inches and\n      pouring on more steam.  It's too close to even bother screaming\n      now; and besides, that would take breath she doesn't have.  The\n      only SOUND is of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, RASPING BREATH and the\n      KNIFE-FINGERS WHISTLING through the air.\n\n\n93.   EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        93.\n\n      NANCY tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of\n      her home, SLAMMING it with all her might.  There's a tremendously\n      satisfying CONCUSSION of wood against doorframe, and the LOCKS\n      fall shut.\n\n\n94.   INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 94.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glennn!!!\n\n      But her voice is garbled as if she's under water, and there's no\n      answer.  The only clue to Glen being there at all is his distant\n      SNORING.  Innocent.  Persistent.  Deep.\n\n      NANCY stops, breath in shreds, face smeared with dirt and tears.\n      Something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen.\n      NANCY looks and catches the MAN prying at the glass with his big\n      knife-fingers, the sharp blades SIZZLING against the edges of the\n      glass as they crack it away from the frame.  NANCY runs upstairs\n      in blind panic.\n\n\n95.   INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        95.\n\n      NANCY darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it.\n\n      Safe at last.\n\n      She listens at the door.  Nothing.  She crosses to her bed.  Next\n      second the KILLER dives through her window and seizes her in a\n      shower of shattered glass!\n\n      NANCY twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with\n      both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat.\n\n      The two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing\n      onto NANCY's bed.  Her grip is broken -- the MAN stabs -- NANCY\n      twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls.  Defenseless,\n      she snatches a pillow up; the KILLER lashes out -- disemboweling\n      the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying.  NANCY\n      dives for escape in a virtual blizzard.\n\n      The KILLER manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two\n      crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all\n      its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers.\n\n      ANGLE AT FLOOR LEVEL -- CLOSE ON NANCY'S AND THE KILLER'S HEADS.\n      The blades inch towards the girl's face -- the drool of the\n      grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her\n      eyes.  Feathers are everywhere; MUSIC is absolutely insane!\n\n      But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her\n      eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to\n      NANCY's head goes off with a jarring RINGGGGGGG!\n\n96.   Instantly the MUSIC STOPS.  And a moment later the room is         96.\n      light.\n\n      WIDER as NANCY reels up, blinded by the sudden light, SCREAMING\n      AND FIGHTING on her bed.\n\n      ANGLE ON GLEN, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening\n      noise.  He discovers NANCY pressed in terror against her\n      headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a\n      straw.\n\n      It's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight.\n\n      NANCY stares incredulously at GLEN, then around the room,\n      untangling herself from her bedclothes.  Wary and furious, her\n      voice hoarse.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen, you bastard...\n\n      The boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm.  She's absolutely\n      livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.\n\n                                      GLEN\t\n                      What I do?\n\n      He reaches for her -- she flattens against the wall, eyes hard,\n      and terribly hurt, too.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (low)\n                      I asked you to do just one thing.\n                      Just stay awake and watch me --\n                      Just wake me if it looked like\n                      I was having a bad dream.\n                              (eyes wild)\n                      But you.  You shit -- what do\n                      you do -- you fall asleep!\n\n      She stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed\n      at how out of control she's become.  And suddenly she breaks,\n      sinking into her \ttorn bedclothes and rubbing her head.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                              (mostly to herself)\n                      I must be going nuts...\n\n                                      MARGE (OS)\n                      Nancy?\n\n      Her mother's door opens OS.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Oh, shit.\n\n      NANCY composes her voice as best she can.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Yes, mother?\n\n      MARGE's flip-flops approach outside the door.  GLEN barrels out\n      the window -- NANCY dives for the bed, jams off the light and\n      disappears under the covers.  MARGE, bleary eyed herself, opens\n      the door and flicks on the light.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (beat)\n                      You okay?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (weakly)\n                      Yeah.  Just had a little dream.\n                      I'm falling right back to sleep.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (beat)\n                      Okay... You need anything, just call.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Okay.\n\n      MARGE closes the door.  NANCY immediately sits up and looks at\n      the window.  A single bone-white feather floats down in the\n      moonlight.  Then it's sucked outside and is gone.\n\n\n97.   EXT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      97.\n\n      GLEN's CADILLAC CONVERTABLE careens into the parking lot and\n      SCREECHES to a stop.  GLEN and NANCY jump out and head for the\n      station.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      You mind telling me what's \n                      going on?\n\n      NANCY's races into the station without answering.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONTD)\n                      Oh, I see.  That makes it all \n                      perfectly clear.\n\n\n98.   INT.  POLICE STATION.  NIGHT.                                      98.\n\n      NANCY goes straight to the SERGEANT's desk.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Garcia, I want to see Rod\n                      Lane again.\n\n      GARCIA winces.\n\n                                      SGT GARCIA\n                      I thought when I took the\n                      night shift I'd have peace\n                      and quiet for a change.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      It's urgent, we've gotta see Rod.\n\n                                      SGT GARCIA\n                      It's three in the morning.\n                      Your mother know you're out this \n                      late?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (faking it)\n                      Of course -- look, at least go\n                      back and look at him.  Just see\n                      if he's okay.\n\n      GARCIA glances at GLEN.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                              (faking it)\n                      We have reason to think there\n                      might be something weird going \n                      on.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON (OS)\n                      Oh, no argument on that.\n\n      NANCY jumps around at the sound of her father's voice.  LT\n      THOMPSON emerges from his office, rumpled and yawning.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Dad -- what you doing here?\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      It so happens I work here, and\n                      there's an unsolved murder.  I\n                      don't like unsolved murders, \n                      especially ones my daughter's\n                      mixed up in -- what are you\n                      doing here at this hour?  You're\n                      supposed to be getting some \n                      sleep.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Listen, sir, this is serious.\n                      Nancy had a nightmare about Rod\n                      being in danger, or something,\n                      and so she thinks...\n\n      He trails off, loosing it under LT THOMPSON's glare.  Besides, he\n      doesn't know exactly what the hell's really going on himself.\n      GARCIA puts his beefy hand on NANCY's shoulder.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I just want to see if he's okay!\n\n                                      SGT GARCIA\n                      Take my word for it, Nancy.  The\n                      guy's sleeping like a baby.  He's\n                      not going anywhere.\n\n\n99.   INT.  CELL BLOCK.  NIGHT.                                          99.\n\n      ANGLE ON ROD in his cell.  He's asleep, all right, but not safely\n      so.  His bedsheet has come alive.  It twitches, pulsates, then\n      snakes towards his throat.\n\n      ROD stirs, the sheet falls still; ROD slips into deeper sleep,\n      and the sheet moves again, completing the noose around his neck!\n\n\n100.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        100.\n\n      NANCY makes a move for the cell block --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      This isn't your average nightmare,\n                      Daddy -- damn it!\n\n      The door's locked; she hauls on it in desperation.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Now look, Nancy, don't push\n                      it.  You've already rubbed my nose\n                      in sex, drugs and violence -- don't\n                      start throwing in insanity!\n\n      NANCY takes that one to heart.  She wheels on him and pleads, her\n      intensity sobering even to him.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Just go back and check -- please!\n\n      The man takes a beat, then shrugs and nods towards SGT GARCIA.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Okay, Garcia.

MUSIC BUILDS as we HOLD ON\n      NANCY'S FACE.\n\n\n101.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          101.\n\n      With a terrible SNAP ROD's sheet jerks tight around his neck.\n      The startled teenager is hauled upright -- eyes popping, face\n      purple.  He claws at the sheet, but despite his strength he can't\n      get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe.  He's dragged\n      backwards across the cot.\n\n\n102.  INT.  BOOKING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        102.\n\n      GARCIA finally has the keys.  Urged on by NANCY he fumbles with\n      the lock.\n\n\n103.  INT.  ROD'S CELL.  NIGHT.                                          103.\n\n      ROD'S being dragged backwards, gasping and struggling in vain\n      against the powerful pull -- right across his cell and up the\n      wall, too.  He clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of\n      the sheet coils around the bars of the high window.  Then there's\n      a powerful wrench of the sheet, and ROD'S neck SNAPS.  The kid's\n      body sags lifeless.\n\n104.  ANGLE THROUGH THE BARS as NANY, GLEN, LT THOMPSON and GARCIA       104.\n      appear in the corridor outside, the girl sprinting ahead.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Rod!\n\n      But it's too late; NANCY sinks back in horror as her father and\n      GARCIA rush into the cell.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Gimme a hand, dammit!\n\n      GLEN, pale as the sheet that's killed ROD, climbs to the bars and\n      unties the knot.  ROD slides down over the SERGEANT'S shoulders,\n      limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed.\n\n                                      SGT GARCIA\n                      Goddamn loco kid -- he didn't\n                      have t'do that -- Madre dios!\n\n      They lay ROD at NANCY's feet; a strange Pieta.

On a hill of sere grass\n      overlooking the valley, the casket of ROD LANE is lowered into\n      its grave.\n\n      A small group of FAMILY and FRIENDS watches soberly as the\n      MINISTER raises his hand in benediction.\n\n                                      MINISTER\n                      Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.\n                      May God be with this young man's\n                      soul.\n\n      ON THE FACES of MARGE, LT THOMPSON, TINA'S MOTHER and ROD'S\n      PARENTS.  Just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an\n      outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks.  Furtive,\n      quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all\n      share, something beyond even this second death among their\n      children.  Then they are all staring ahead again, as if the\n      others weren't even there.\n\n                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)\n                      His life and his death attest to\n                      the Scripture's warning that he who\n                      lives by the sword shall die by\n                      the sword.\n\n      ANGLE ON GLEN, watching --\n\n      NANCY, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.\n\n                                      MINISTER (CONTD OS)\n                      But let us recall also our Lord's\n                      admonition that we 'Judge not,\n                      lest we be judged.'  Let us\n                      attempt only to love.  And may\n                      Rod Lane rest in peace.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (quietly)\n                      Amen to that much.\n\n      The mourners walk away from the grave, MARGE among them.  She\n      pauses near a MAN and two WOMEN in black -- TINA'S MOTHER, ROD'S\n      PARENTS.  They almost, it seems, speak.  Then MARGE hurries on.\n\n      WE MOVE WITH HER as she's joined by LT THOMPSON.  Both are worn\n      and on edge.  THOMPSON absently lights another cigarette,\n      offering one to MARGE.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      How's Nancy doing?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I don't think she's slept since\n                      Tina died.\n                              (shakes her head)\n                      She's always been a delicate\n                      kid.\n\n      THOMPSON lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of\n      nonchalance.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      She's tougher than you think.\n                      Any idea how she knew Rod was\n                      gonna kill himself?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      No.  All I know is, this reminds\n                      me too much of ten years ago.\n\n      THOMPSON blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks\n      away.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Yeah.  Well... Let's not start\n                      digging up bodies just because \n                      we're in a cemetery.\n\n      He gives her a look that could cut stone.  MARGE toses down her\n      cigarete and crosses to NANCY.  The girl is simply staring off\n      over the valley.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (very gently)\n                      Time to go home, baby.\n\n      She moves her away from the brink of the hill.\n\n\n106.

NANCY turns\n      to them both, speaking in a still, small voice.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      The killer's still loose,\n                      you know.\n\n      She has a wild, Cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up\n      MARGE'S spine.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      You saying somebody else killed\n                      Tina?  Who?\n\n      NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I don't know who he is.  But he's\n                      burned, he wears a weird hat, a\n                      red and yellow sweater, real\n                      dirty, and he uses some sort of\n                      knifes he's got made into a sort\n                      of... glove.  Like giant finger-\n                      nails.\n\n      As NANCY has described this monster from her dream, unseen by\n      her, \tthe faces of MARGE LT and THOMPSON have drained completely\n      of color.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                              (low, even, to MARGE)\n                      I think you should keep Nancy\n                      at home a few days.  'Til she's\n                      really over the shock.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I got something better...\n                              (to NANCY)\n                      I'm gonna get you help, baby.\n                      So no one will threaten you\n                      any more.\n\n      She takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car,\n      locking the door from outside.  NANCY never taking her eyes from\n      her father's as the car bears her away.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n                                              BURN ON:\n\n                              THE FIFTH DAY\n\n\n107.

The girl is lying on a simple broad cot, in her\n      pajamas.  The room is subdued in color and holds only this single\n      bed.  A large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room\n      beyond.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      But I just don't feel... ready\n                      to sleep yet.

He treats NANCY at all times like a young\n      adult, never patronizing.

Let's do it.\n\n      Greatly relieved, MARGE gives NANCY a goodnight kiss, then\n      follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror.  As soon as\n      her mother is out of sight, NANCY'S eyes drift to the mirror\n      itself.  In its reflection she sees herself looking back, alone\n      on the bed.\n\n                                              DISSOLVE TO:\n\n\t\n110.  INT.

And KING monitors the girl even more closely\n      with a bank of instruments -- a mass of glowing dials, graphs and\n      meters.  His manner with MARGE is slightly more sober.\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      How long's this been going on?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Since the murder.

Then there's a slight alteration in the sound of\n      the EKG.  KING nods in satisfaction.\n\n                                      DR KING (CONTD)\n                      Okay, good.

All normal.\n                      She could dream at any time now.\n                              (beat)\n                      Right now she's like a diver\n                      on the bottom of an ocean no\n                      one's mapped yet.  Waiting to\t\n                      see what shows up.\n\n\n115.  INT.  THE SLEEPING ROOM.                                           115.\n\n      We can see NANCY drift from the initial stage, over the\n      brink into deep sleep.  Her hair falls into her eyes; her face\n      relaxes; her shoulders curl round her like comforters.  THE MUSIC\n      DEEPENS, and begins to hint at the tones of the NIGHTMARE THEME.\n\n\n116.  INT.  CONTROL ROOM.  DAY.                                          116.\n\n      DR KING and MARGE watch the instruments' every move.\n\n      One of the machines begins a slight CHIRPING.  KING scans it,\n      liking what he sees.\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      Okay, she's started to dream.\n\n      He leans forward in his chair, like a pilot starting an\n      instrument approach.  MARGE THOMPSON licks her dry lips, fighting\n      a turn of nausea.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      How can you tell?\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      R.E.M.'s.  Rapid eye movements.\n                      The eyes follow the\n                      dream -- their movement picks\n                      up on this --\n\n      He prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note\n      pad.\n\n                                      DR KING (CONTD)\n                      Beta Waves are slowing, too.\n                      She's dreaming, all right.\n                      A good one, too.\n\n      MARGE watches the TV MONITOR.  It's in extra-close on NANCY's\n      eyes -- and they're darting beneath the lids, reacting to events\n      lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons.\n\n      KING points to a moving graph.  A needle's begun waving lazily\n      between plus and minus three.  The DOCTOR nods, assured.\n\n                                      DR KING (CONTD)\n                      Typical dream parameter.  A\n                      nightmare, now, would be plus or\n                      minus five or six; she's just \n                      around three point --\n\n      He stops.  Outside, visible through the glass, NANCY twists\n      around.  Eyes still closed, she's nevertheless holding her head\n      in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the\n      predator's approach.\n\n      MARGE looks from her daughter to the DOCTOR, color draining from\n      her face.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      What the hell's this?  She\n                      awake or asleep?\n\n      The needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up, plunges, then\n      surges well above the eight mark.  A strange MUSIC CUE --\n      disonant and threatening, creeps in -- the NIGHTMARE THEME\n      slurred into awful minors and weird disonance.  KING stares at\n      the gauge in disbelief, rapping his finger on its glass.\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      Can't be.  It never gets\n                      this high...\n\n      The needle swings even higher, benind.\n\n                                      DR KING (CONTD)\n                      Jesus H. Christ.\n\n      He's cut off by the high-pitched KEENING of the girl, the SOUND\n      cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar.\n      A warning BEEPER has begun, the instruments light up like a\n      Christmas tree -- and outside in the sleeping room, NANCY is\n      contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts.  KING knocks\n      over his chair in his sprint for the door.\n\n\n117.  INT.  SLEEPING ROOM.                                               117.\n\n      The DOCTOR and MARGE come in on the run -- NANCY's flailing and\n      screaming as if the devil himself were after her.  KING grabs her\n      to shake her awake;\n\n      ANGLE ON NANCY (eyes open) -- looking in terror -- SOUND ECHOED\n      STRANGELY.\n\n      IN HER POV -- dressed in KING'S clothes -- the horribly scarred\n      MAN reaches out.\n\n      WIDER -- (NANCY'S eyes closed in sleep) as the girl's fist shoots\n      out with incredible force and knocks DR KING flying!\n\n      The NURSE and MARGE both descend on her --\n\n      and again in her SLEEPING POV we see the MAN stagger for her.\n\n      WIDER ON NANCY -- (still in her nightmare) -- fighting like a\n      tiger with both MARGE and the NURSE -- sending the NURSE\n      sprawling -- leaving MARGE hanging on for dear life.\n\n      ANGLE on the stunned DOCTOR fumbling with a hyperdermic needle,\n      spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands --\n      the SCREAMS AND CURSES of NANCY are deafening and worthy of a\n      stevador fighting off his worst enemy.  Stranger still, her hair\n      is electrified, standing on end and greying before their very\n      eyes!\n\n      MARGE screams at the top of her lungs.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      NANCY!!!  IT'S MOM -- NANCY!!!!\n\n      Some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl, and her\n      eyes flap open -- they're glazed with terror and fury, but open.\n      NANCY's awake.\n\n      She stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the\n      bed, her purple face gasping out gut-wrenching SOBS.  The NURSE\n      and MARGE dare to go back in and hold the sweat-drenched girl as\n      DR KING comes for her with the needle.\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      Now, this is just going to let\n                      you relax and sleep, Nan --\n\n      With incredible swiftness, NANCY backhands the hypodermic into a\n      far wall, shattering it into a million pieces.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      No.  That's enough sleep.\n\n      Her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into\n      KING'S face.  He dabs his split lip, swallowing painfully.\n\n                                      DR KING\n                      Okay, kid.  Okay.  Fair enough.\n\n      He holds out his hand.  NANCY at last takes it, and sags back\n      into her pillow, exhausted.  Then KING comes up with blood on his\n      hand.\n\n      He stares at it, dumbfounded, then at the girl.  Across her left\n      forearm, a deep gash is bleeding freely, as if made by a very\n      sharp instrument.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Oh my god, oh my god...\n\n                                      DR KING\n                              (to the NURSE)\n                      Get the kit!\n\n      The NURSE scrambles away as the DOCTOR claps his hand over the\n      wounds.  He looks into NANCY's face.  What he sees frightens him\n      even more: NANCY'S haunted, ghost-like eyes turn from him to her\n      mother, and a terrible, chilling smile opens across NANCY's white\n      lips.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      You believe this?\n\n      She pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a\n      strange hat, filthy and worn -- the KILLER'S hat.  The sight of\n      it frightens MARGE more than anything that's come before.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (deathly pale)\n                      Where the hell did you get that?\n\n      NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I grabbed it off his head.\n\n      MARGE stares at the hat as if it held her whole future, and her\n      future was a horror.\n\n                                              FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n118.

INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  DAY.                                       119.\n\n      MARGE is on the telephone, the dirty hat in her hand.  Nearby is\n      a nearly empty bottle of gin.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      She said she snatched it off\n                      his head in a dream.\n                              (listens)\n                      No, I'm not crazy, I've got\n                      the damn thing in my hand!\n                              (listens)\n                      I know we did, we all...\n                              (hears NANCY \n                               approaching)\n                      Gotta go.\n\n      She hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer,\n      screening the action with her body.  NANCY enters.\n\n      By now the girl has an extraordinary look.  Her hair is ashen,\n      her skin transluscent, and eyes dark-ringed.  Her right forearm\n      is heavily bandaged over the slashes.  In short, instead of the\n      girl next door, we now could be looking at the lunatic from the\n      next cell.  MARGE, though she does her best to hide it, is\n      downright frightened of her.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      You didn't sleep, did you?\n                      The doctor says you have to \n                      sleep or you'll --\n\n      NANCY pours herself a cup of black coffee.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Go even crazier?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I don't think you're going\n                      crazy -- and stop drinking\n                      that damn coffee!\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Did you ask Daddy to have the \n                      hat examined?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I threw that filthy thing away --\n                      I don't know what you're trying \n                      to prove with it, but --\n\n      NANCY comes closer, her eyes shining with a new sureness.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      What I learned at the dream\n                      clinic, that's what I'm trying\n                      to prove.  Rod didn't kill Tina, \n                      and he didn't hang himself.\n                      It's this guy -- he's after\n                      us in our dreams.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      But that's just not reality,\n                      Nancy!\n\n120.  Furious, NANCY janks open the drawer before MARGE can stop her     120.\n      and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter.\n\n      MARGE grabs away the bottle protectively -- but it's the hat\n      NANCY goes for.  She waves it triumphantly -- demonically. \n\n                                      NANCY\n                      It's real, Mamma.

You know who that\n                      is, Mamma?  You better tell me,\n                      cause now he's after me!\n\n      MARGE swallows, then persists in the lie.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Nancy, trust your mother for \n                      once -- you'll feel better as \n                      soon as you sleep!\n\n      NANCY shoots a hard humorless laugh, holding up her slashed arm.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      You call this feeling better?\n                      Or should I grab a bottle and\n                      veg out with you -- avoid \n                      everything happening to me\n                      by just getting good and loaded --\n\n      MARGE slaps her hard.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (losing it)\n                      Fred Krueger can't be after you,\n                      Nancy -- he's dead!\n\n      The room falls silent, both women staring at the other.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                              (low, raw)\n                      Fred Krueger is dead.

NANCY is furious, betrayed.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      You knew about him all\n                      this time, and you've been acting\n                      like he was someone I made up!\n\n      MARGE pulls away.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      You're sick, Nancy.

You need to sleep,\n                      it's as simple as that.\n\n      NANCY wheels and smashes MARGE'S bottle of gin in the sink.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Screw sleep!\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      Nancy!\n\n      But NANCY runs past her mother for the front door.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      Nancy -- it's only a nightmare!\n\n      NANCY turns in the doorway.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      That's enough!\n\n      On the door SLAM, we\n\n                                              CUT TO\n\n\n121.  EXT.  SHAKESPEARE BRIDGE.  DAY.                                    121.\n\n      ANGLE ON A NEIGHBORHOOD STREET.  We hear GLEN's VOICE and PAN UP\n      to REVEAL NANCY and GLEN high above, two tiny figures walking\n      across this strange white bridge in old Los Angeles.  CAMERA\n      BEGINS A SLOW ZOOM.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Whenever I get nervous I eat.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      And if you can't do that, you\n                      sleep.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Used to.  Not anymore.\n\n      GLEN jams more Big Mack into his face.  By now our ZOOM reveals\n      he's attacking a huge bag of Big Macks, and furtively eyeing\n      NANCY.  The girl's hair is startlingly white in the sunlight.\n      She's reading a book, hardly paying attention.\n\n                                      GLEN (CONTD)\n                      You ever read about the Balinese\n                      way of dreaming?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      No.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      They got a whole system they\n                      call 'dream skills'.  So, if\n                      you have a nightmare, for \n                      instance like falling, right?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Yeah.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Instead of screaming and getting \n                      nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna\n                      make up my mind that I fall\n                      into a magic world where I can\n                      get something special, like a \n                      poem or song.\n                              (grins hopefully)\n                      They get all their art literature\n                      from dreams.  Just wake up and \n                      write it down.  Dreamskills.\n\n      He stops, seeing the look on NANCY's face.  Our ZOOM is much\n      closer now, a wide medium, and still coming in on the kids.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      And what if they meet a monster\n                      in their dream?  Then what?\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      They turn their back on it.\n                              (grins hopefully)\n                      Takes away its energy, and\n                      it disappears.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      What happens if they don't do\n                      that?\n\n                                      GLEN\n                              (shrugs)\n                      I guess those people don't\n                      wake up to tell what happens.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Great.\n\n      She leans over the railing, poking her face back into her book.\n      GLEN tips its cover and reads its title.  OUR ZOOM IS STILL\n      MOVING CLOSER, a MEDIUM CLOSE UP NOW.\n \n                                      GLEN\n                      'Booby Traps and Improvised \n                      Anti-personel Devices'!\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I found it at this neat\n                      survivalist bookstore on\n                      Ventura.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                              (shocked)\n                      Well what you reading it for?\n\n      OUR ZOOM LOCKS IN ON A TIGHT TWO ON THEIR FACES, NANCY's grimly\n      determined.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I'm into survival.\n\n      She walks away, OUT OF FRAME, leaving GLEN watching after her in\n      astonishment.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      She's starting to scare the\n                      living shit out of me.\n\n\n122.  EXT. ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME/EVENING                               122.\n\n      ANGLE ACROSS NANCY'S \"TREE LAWN\", the grass between\n      the sidewalk and the street, in the general direction\n      of GLEN's home.  This ANGLE doesn't quite reveal\n      Nancy's house.\n\n      FOREGROUND is a utility truck in which a half dozen\n      Hispanic WORKERS are loading tools, extension cords\n      and hardware.  They\n      look like they've put in one hell of a hard day's work.\n\n      MARGE appears and hands a check to the FOREMAN of the crew, a\n      white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain.  He scrutinizes\n      it.\n\n                                      FOREMAN\n                      And the other...\n\n      MARGE forks over a wad of cash, hands trembling in her\n      half-drunk, helpless rage.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Where's your mask and gun?\n\n      The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly.\n\n                                      FOREMAN\n                      Don't bust my chops, lady.\n                      If the city found out I put\n                      'em in without inside releases\n                      I'd loose my license.\n\n      He shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck.  MARGE\n      EXITS FRAME for her house.\n\n      PAN WITH THE TRUCK as it pulls away, THEN PICK UP NANCY, walking\n      across the street from the corner.  Alone.  Dispirited.  She\n      lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Oh gross...\n\n123.  WIDENING TO REVEAL THE HOUSE as NANCY walks across her front       123.\n      yard.  Every single window has been covered with brand-new\n      ornamental iron bars, bolted deeply into their frames.\n\n      CLOSER, AT A WINDOW.  NANCY gives a set of bars a powerful\n      shake.  They don't budge.  Then girl looks up and sees even the\n      window to her second floor bedroom is barred.  And the rose\n      trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a\n      tangle of wood, thorns and broken flowers.\n\n\n124.  INT.  MARGE'S ROOM.  EVENING.                                      124.\n\n      ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY INTO THE HALL.  Easy listening MUSIC wafts\n      through the air.  NANCY appears in the doorway.\n\n                                      NANCY (OS)\n                      Mom, what's with the bars!?\n\n125.  REVERSE to MARGE, propped against the headboard of her bed, a      125.\n      crooked shadow in the gloom.  A fresh bottle of Gin glints in her\n      hand.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Oh, Mom...\n\n      The girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle.  MARGE\n      snatches it away.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      'S'mine...\n\n      She rocks the bottle in her arms.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      What's with the bars?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      S'curity.\n\n      NANCY sits on the bed, a surprising compassion entering her\n      voice.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Mom, I want to know what you\n                      know about Fred Krueger.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Dead and gone.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I want to know how, where --\n                      if you don't tell me, I'm going\n                      to call daddy.\n\n      MARGE gives a laugh -- a rasping chachination from deep in her\n      chest.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      Your father the cop.

He's not\n                      dead and gone -- he's after me\n                      and if I sleep he'll get me!\n                      I've got to know!\n\n      MARGE blinks at her a moment, then cracks a terrible, crooked\n      grin.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      All right.\n\n\n126.  INT. NANCY'S CELLAR/NIGHT                                          126.\n\n      MARGE drags NANCY headlong down the cellar stairs and across the\n      room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation.\n      And she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that NANCY\n      reels from the alcohol.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      You want to know who Fred\n                      Krueger was?  He was a filthy\n                      child killer who got at least\n                      twenty kids, kids from our\n                      area, kids we all knew.  It\n                      drove us all crazy when we\n                      didn't know who was doing it --\n                      but it was even worse when\n                      they caught him.\n\n      MARGE draws herself up with a shake.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      Oh lawyers got fat and the judge\n                      got famous, but someone forgot to\n                      sign the search warrant in the \n                      right place, and Fred Krueger\n                      was free, just like that.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      So he's alive?\n\n      MARGE smiles grimly.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      He wouldn've stopped.  The \n                      bastard would've got more\n                      kids first chance he got --\n                      they found nearly ten bodies\n                      in his boiler room as it\n                      was.  But the law couldn't\n                      touch him.\n\n      At the mention of \"boiler room\", NANCY gives a shake.  MARGE\n      misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never\n      left her hand.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      What was needed were some private\n                      citizens willing to do what had\n                      to be done.\n\n      She reels slowly, looking at NANCY is defiance.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (hushed)\n                      What did you do, mother?\n\n      MARGE cradles the bottle.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Bunch of us parents tracked him\n                      down after they let him go.  Found\n                      him in an old boiler room, just\n                      like before.  Saw him lying there\n                      in that caked red and yellow sweater\n                      he always wore, drunk an' asleep\n                      with his weird knives by his side...\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (dreading it)\n                      Go on...\n\n      MARGE reaches over and taps a dusty two-gallon jug of gasoline\n      near the lawn mower.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      We poured gasoline all around\n                      the place, left a trail out the \n                      door, locked the door, then...\n\n      She mimes striking a match --\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      WHOOSH!!!\n\n      Her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that\n      fire.  There's awe in her voice.  Then she drops her arms.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                              (hushed, remembering)\n                      But just when it seemed not\n                      even the devil could live\n                      in there any more -- he crashed\n                      out like a banshee, all on fire\n                      -- swinging those fingerknives\n                      every which direction and \n                      screaming he... he was going\n                      to get us by killing all our\n                      kids...\n\n      She stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment.  But\n      the intake doesn't hide the image.  Her face bathed in tears, she\n      looks at her daughter and shakes her head.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      There were all those men, Nancy,\n                      even your father, oh yes, even\n                      him.  But none could do what\n                      had to be done -- Krueger rolling \n                      and screaming so loud the whole\n                      state could hear -- no one could\n                      take your father's gun and kill \n                      him good and proper except me.\n\n      She sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then\n      stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified.  She\n      looks at her daughter, begging.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      So he's dead Nan.  He can't\n                      get you.  Mommy killed him.\n\n\tFor someone who started this film at a very young seventeen,\n      NANCY's now the battle-tempered veteran as she takes her mother\n      in her arms and rocks her.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Who was there?  Were Tina's \n                      parents there?  Were Rod's?\n\n      MARGE sags back.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Sure, and Glen's.  All of us.\n                      But that's in the past now,\n                      baby.  Really.  It's over.\n                              (slyly)\n                      We even took his knives.\n\n      The woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace -- a\n      furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in.  She\n      fishes inside the cavity -- as then we hear a touch of the\n      familiar 'SCRRIITCH'.  Next moment she pulls out an object\n      wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades\n      and their glove-like apparatus.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      See?\n\n      NANCY stares at the damn things, chilled.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      All these years you've kept those\n                      things buried down here?

As for him,\n                      we buried him good and deep.\n\n      MARGE shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the\n      little iron door.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      So's okay, you can sleep.\n\n      She lurches up and staggers upstairs.\n\n      NANCY shivers and looks down at her arm.  The cut beneath her\n      bandage has begun to bleed again.  And from inside the furnace,\n      as if from deep below, the PULSING of the boundless\n      nightmare-boiler room can be faintly heard.\n\n\n127.  EXT.  ELM STREET.

NANCY's still something of a wreck, but less\n      than \tMARGE.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      We'll go away, take a vacation.\n                      Get your hair colored nice, the\n                      way it was.  No one will ever\n                      know.\n                              (sniffs)\n                      This whole room smells of coffee,\n                      y'know?\n\n      She gathers up NANCY's coffee cups and empty NoDoz boxes, leans\n      down and kisses her.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                      It's all over now, baby.  The\n                      nightmare's over.  Please.\n\n      NANCY nods her head, half stubborn, half sadly.  She can barely\n      keep her eyes open now.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Okay.\n\n      She scrunches into her pillow.  MARGE smiles haggardly and shuts\n      off the light, taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Night-night.\n\n      MARGE smiles, relieved.  The girl pulls the blanket around her\n      shoulders.  Her eyes flutter closed, her breathing becomes regular\n      and deep.  Once again she's the litle girl MARGE fantasizes she\n      is.\n\n      The mother tiptoes out of the room, closing the door behind her.\n      HOLD ON NANCY's sleeping face as the DOOR CLOSES.  Her eyes\n      remain closed another beat, then open wide.\n\n      She quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to\n      scatter the sleep settling so quickly.\n\n      Still in the dark, she fishes a full electric coffepot from under\n      her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from\n      beneath her pillow.  The face illuminated by the neon light on the\n      pot is set in absolute determination.\n\n      NANCY drains the cup, then crosses to her closet, retrieves a\n      pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes\n      her eyes and the back of her neck.  That done she eases open her\n      window and presses her face to the bars, sucking in cool night\n      air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain.\n\n      Then she starts pulling on clothes.\n\n\n142.  INT.  NANCY'S HOUSE/DOWNSTAIRS.  NIGHT.                            142.\n\n      ANGLE ON MARGE as she checks the lock on the backdoor.  Firm.\n\n143.  ANGLE IN THE LIVING ROOM as she pads through the darkened house,   143.\n      feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book.  Then\n      another, and a third.  Then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of\n      gin.\n\n\n144.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOUSE AND ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                        144.\n\n      The sky has gathered in greater darkness.  LOW, DISTANT THUNDER\n      rolls around the horizon like a great drum.\n\n      ANGLE ON NANCY'S HOUSE from across the street.  The moon glints\n      off the barred windows. CAMERA ZOOMS to NANCY's window.  The\n      imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a\n      ghost, her eyes turned towards GLEN's.  Then she switches to\n      something much CLOSER TO CAMERA ANGLE, and she draws back.\n\n145.  REVERSE ON GLEN's father, standing on the front porch of his       145.\n      home, also in the shadows, looking straight across and up at\n      NANCY.  He \tdraws on his cigarette; his face glows red.\n\n146.  NANCY pulls down the shade.                                        146.\n\n147.  GLEN's father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe.               147.\n\n                                      MRS LANTZ\n                      Shouldn't stare.\n\n      As the man turns our SHOT WIDENS TO REVEAL MRS LANTZ.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ\n                      Know what I think?  I think \n                      that kid's some kinda lunatic.\n\n      The woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her\n      forehead.\n\n                                      MRS LANTZ\n                      Shouldn't say such a thing about\n                      the poor child.  If you mean the \n                      bars, Marge's just being cautious,\n                      her being alone and Nancy acting\n                      so nervous lately.\n\n      The woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room.  As\n      he goes inside he takes one last look.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)\n                      Well, she ain't gonna hang around\n                      our boy no more.\n\n      Once the two are inside, the door is locked.\n\n\n148.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        148.\n\n      CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  VERY CLOSE.  Her eyes stare ahead,\n      red-rimmed, anxious.  She picks absently at the thick bandage\n      covering her forearm.  The long cuts from Fred Krueger's fingers\n      are bleeding again, but she doesn't even care anymore.  Too late\n      to sweat the small stuff.  She crosses the room.\n\n      On the bedside table with the nearly empty Pyrex coffee maker,\n      the empty cup and the empty box of No-Doz, is her old fashioned\n      alarm clock, and a phone.\n\n      NANCY pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the\n      dregs, then looks to the clock.\n\n      INSERT CLOCK -- ten minutes to midnight.\n\n      NANCY'S eyes go to the door.\n\n      WIDER.  Fully clothed and in a jacket now, she creeps to the door\n      and cracks it, just to make sure.  Then freezes.\n\n\n149.  INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE NANCY'S DOOR.                                149.\n\n      IN NANCY'S POV through the door we see MARGE, rummaging around in\n      the linen closet not fifteen feet away.  There's no way NANCY can\n      get past her.  The woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in\n      satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap.\n\n\n150.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        150.\n\n      NANCY eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole,\n      watching through it with a sinking heart.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (very quiet, very intense)\n                      Hang on GLEN...\n\n\n151.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         151.\n\n      GLEN, coat now on, goes to his window, checking.\n\n\n152.  INT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          152.\n\n      GLEN'S POV -- NANCY'S porch is deserted; front door closed,\n      lights out.  No sign of NANCY.\n\n\n153.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         153.\n\n      GLEN shrugs, takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                      Well, I'm not gonna risk\n                      sneaking out until she does.\n\n      He puts the earphones back on.\n\n\n154.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        154.\n\n      Absolutely frustrated, NANCY turns from the keyhole to the\n      window. She opens the blind and eases back the curtain.\n\n\n155.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.\n\n      IN NANCY'S POV THROUGH THE BARS we ZOOM directly across to GLEN's\n      window.\n\n\n156.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         156.\n\n      GLEN lies on his bed, fully clothed, earphones over his ears,\n      CARSON droning from the TV.  And the boy's eyes begin to droop.\n\n\n157.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     157.\n\n      NANCY picks up her phone, bites her lip, then begins dialing.\n\n\n158.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         158.\n\n      TIGHT ON PHONE as it begins RINGING loudly.\n\n      WIDER SHOT, revealing GLEN asleep BACKGROUND, the MUSIC still\n      LOUD in his earphones.\n\n\n159.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  159.\n\n      RINGING here, too, just as MR LANTZ is turning out the lights for\n      bed.  He stops in the dark, scowling.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ\n                      Who at this hour?\n\n      He refuses to turn the light back on.  His wife picks her way to\n      the telephone.\n\n                                      MRS LANTZ\n                      Hello?\n                              (listens, frowns\n                               slightly)\n                      Oh... Hold on.\n                              (covers the mouthpiece)\n                      It's her.  She wants to talk to\n                      Glen.\n\n      The father crosses to the telephone, suspicious.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ\n                              (whispering)\n                      About what?\n\n                                      MRS LANTZ\n                              (into phone)\n                      What's this about, Nancy?\n\n      She listens, covers up again.\n\n                                      MRS LANTZ (CONTD)\n                      She says it's private.  Very \n                      private and very important.\n\n      MR LANTZ grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ\n                      Glen's asleep.  Talk to him\n                      tomorrow!\n\n      He SLAMS down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his\n      wife.\n\n                                      MR LANTZ (CONTD)\n                      Just got to be firm with kids,\n                      is all.\n\n      Then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it\n      on the table.\n\n\n160.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        160.\n\n      NANCY dials again.  This time she gets a BUSY SIGNAL.  She slams\n      the phone down in frustration and looks out the window.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen.  Don't fall asleep...\n\n      She goes and sits on the bed, propping her chin on her fists.\n161.  Yawns.  The TELEPHONE RINGS.                                       161.\n\n      NANCY snatches it up.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Glen?\n\n      TIGHT ON HER, ZOOMING EVEN CLOSER ON HER EAR AND THE EARPIECE as\n      we HEAR the awful SCRITCHING SCRAPE of STEEL FINGERKNIVES.\n\n      NANCY slaps the phone down as if it were diseased -- then, in\n      pure rage, rips the thing's cord from the wall.\n\n      Spent instantly, she puts the receiver back on the cradle and\n      lays it on her bed, chiding herself.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Brilliant.  Now what if Glen\n                      calls?\n\n      She wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it\n      on her bed, then sneaks back to the door.  This time she gives an\n      expression of relief, and opens the door.  MARGE is gone.\n\n      Then the TELEPHONE RINGS again.\n\n      CAMERA MOVES IN ON NANCY as she turns slowly.\n\n162.  REVERSE IN HER POV.  THE TELEPHONE RINGS again, despite the fact   162.\n      that the end of its janked-out cord is clearly visible.  The\n      NIGHTMARE MUSIC THEME slips right up our spines.\n\n      BACK ON NANCY.  She starts to shake.  She goes to the telephone\n      as we WIDEN, unwraps it as it RINGS even louder.  She's shaking\n      so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver.  MOVE\n      IN CLOSE ON HER, so close we can HEAR her teeth chattering as she\n      brings the phone to her ear.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Hello?\n\n      The unmistakeable VOICE of FRED KRUEGER comes over the phone,\n      garbled by time and unknown dimensions, but clear enough.\n\n                                      KRUEGER (FILTER)\n                              (triumphant)\n                      I'm your boyfriend now...\n\n      CLOSE ON THE MOUTHPIECE.  It's changed from a normal telephone\n      mouthpiece to an actual mouth -- Fred Krueger's mouth -- and his\n      long, slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girl's\n      mouth!\n\n      WIDER -- as NANCY explodes from her micro-dream -- absolutely\n      mad.  She jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it\n      against her wall, then attacks it with her feet and hands,\n      smashing it to smithereens.\n\n      ANGLE ON THE TELEPHONE PIECES.  Normal pieces of a normal\n      telephone.\n\n      She pinches herself hard -- until tears come and her flesh is\n      nearly bleeding.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I'm awake, I am awake.  This is\n                      not a dream!  I am --\n\n      She stops, realizing what Krueger meant.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      My boyfriend...!\n\n\n163.  INT.  NANCY'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                 163.\n\n      NANCY barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room\n      to the front door.\n\n      It takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the\n      deadbolt is locked from inside.  And there's no key in it now.\n\n      She races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and\n      banging on the bars like a mad woman.  But there's no getting\n      through.  She staggers back, stymied and furious.  Then somebody\n      moves behind her in the dark.\n\n                                      VOICE (OS)\n                      Locked.\n\n      NANCY jumps around in shock.  Her mother has posted herself on\n      the couch with her bottle.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (furious)\n                      Give me the key, mother.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      I don't even have it on me,\n                      so forget it.\n\n      The word is final.  NANCY runs past the woman to the back door,\n      to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks\n      and SCREAMING in teenage fury.  But it's no good.  The house is\n      her prison.\n\n                                      MARGE (CONTD)\n                              (drunk satisfaction)\n                      Paid the guy damn good to make\n                      sure you stayed put.  You ain't\n                      goin' nowhere, kid.  You're\n                      gonna sleep tonight if it kills\n                      me.\n\n      NANCY clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a\n      heart-wrenching, eardrum-breaking cry of love in despair --\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      GLEEENNNNNN!\n\n                                                SMASH CUT TO:\n\n164.  INT.  GLEN'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         164.\n\n      CLOSE ON GLEN'S FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE.  The MUSIC is tinny from the\n      earphones, the TV SOUND DISTANT AND ECHOED.  The boy is breathing\n      deeply now, slowly and gently.  Then, unmistakeably, he begins to\n      SNORE.  Very faintly, far in the background, we can hear NANCY.\n\n                                      NANCY (OS)\n                      Glen!!  Don't fall asleeeeeep!\n\n      CAMERA PULLS BACK AND STRAIGHT UP as the SNORES merge with a\n      weird, unsettling MUSIC CUE.  The boy lies sprawled, still\n      clothed, in the middle of his bed.  Save for the bedside lamp,\n      the room is dark.\n\n      FULL WIDE ANGLE FROM THIS HIGH SPOT looking down at him as from\n      the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling.  THE MUSIC\n      REACHES A TERRIFYING PITCH OF ANTICIPATION -- THEN STOPS\n      ABRUPTLY.\n\n      There's a heartbeat's pause.  Then with tremendous force, two\n      powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and\n      grab GLEN around the waist!\n\n      Next moment the young man's body is dragged straight down into\n      the bed, as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him\n      down!  His feet and his arms shoot up -- there's another hauling\n      yank -- and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers\n      -- down into the pit in the middle of the bed!  His hands are\n      last to go, clawing for a hold.  But soon they vanish as well,\n      dragging blankets and bedsheets, wires and stereo across the\n      caved-in bed and into the abyss.\n\n      There's HIDEOUS SCREECHING of MUSIC jamming in with GLEN's\n      ECHOING SCREAMS -- then an unholy, sudden silence.\n\n      Next moment what's left of GLEN is vomited up from the pit of the\n      nightmare bed...a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and\n      wires...streaming out and over the bed.  Then the pit in the bed\n      is gone as if it were never there.\n\n      Drawn by the terribly screams and struggle, GLEN's mother bursts\n      into the room.  The women stares for one moment of horrified\n      disbelief, then reels back and lets out the most god-awful SCREAM\n      imaginable.  The cry splits the night.\n\n\n165.  EXT.  ELM STREET.  NIGHT.                                          165.\n\n      The SOUND of the SCREAM CROSS-FADES WITH the WAIL of the\n      AMBULANCE as it screeches to a halt at the curb, followed by two\n      BLACK AND WHITES and an UNMARKED CAR.  Uniformed POLICEMEN spill\n      out FOREGROUND.\n\n      LT THOMPSON and PARKER exit the unmarked car.  By habit or by\n      premonition THOMPSON glances at the house that was his home.  His\n      eye is caught by a movement; his daughter is at her upstairs\n      window, white-haired, hollow-eyed, looking down on him through\n      her bars.  She gives a little wave.\n\n      Unnerved, THOMPSON waves back, then walks rapidly for GLEN's\n      home.  MR LANTZ, pale as a ghost himself, waits on the porch; we\n      can hear the mother's WAILING inside.\n\n\n166.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS, NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                           180.\n\n      LOW ANGLE UP STAIRS as NANCY appears at head.  As she comes\n      downstairs, CAMERA MOVES WITH HER through the hallway to the\n      cellar door.  She opens the door.\n\n\n180A. INT.  NANCY'S CELLAR.  NIGHT.                                      180A.\n\n      NANCY appears at top of these stairs, hesitates, then comes down.\n\n      WIDER as NANCY approaches center of room, stops in CU, then turns\n      eyes.  We HEAR the distant SOUND of the boiler room now, faint\n      but unmistakeable.  NANCY MOVES, and CAMERA PANS HER to the\n      cellar's side WALL, where another, new doorway is REVEALED.\n      NANCY opens this door and looks down.  FIRELIGHT is on NANCY'S\n      face now, and the SOUND of the Boiler Room is very clear.  NANCY\n      goes through the door.\n\n\n180B. INT.  BOILER ROOM.                                                 180B.\n\n      NANCY decends like Orpheus into hell, but without weapon save her\n      wits.\n\n      She decends a steel stair to the lowest level, then hears the\n      SOUND of the knives from down another shaft.  She sees there's an\n      even deeper place down there.  She starts down.\n\n      Again, and then again, NANCY decends, each ladder narrower or\n      more twisting, each level deeper, wetter, darker, more airless.\n      Soon she's gasping for air, but still she pushes herself on. She\n      doesn't stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of\n      the place, a wet, firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place.\n\n      CAMERA NOW PANS AROUND WITH HER, and for the first time we SEE\n      the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her.\n\n      She stares at it.  It's seething with some dark WIND that soughs\n      and whines like a huge dying dog.\n\n      NANCY crosses to it, touching the pile of old, coal-dusted dirt\n      at its base.  It looks almost like an old grave.\n\n      She turns suddenly, listening.  Then, hearing nothing, she looks\n      down.\n\n      NANCY'S POV as she picks up GLEN's earphones.\n\n      WIDER as she suddenly drops them, staring at her fingers.\n      They're dripping blood.\n\n      There's another BEEP.\n\n180C. INSERT ON NANCY'S WATCH -- the COUNT-DOWN a blur of black digits   180C.\n      counting down to zero.  They've just crossed the ten minute\n      warning.\n\n180D. CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She speaks into the night.                 180D.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (quietly)\n                      Come out and show yourself,\n                      you bastard.\n\n      No sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of FRED\n      KRUEGER lurches up behind her!  The man is even more hideous\n      hatless, his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of\n      ruined flesh, his ragged teeth barred, the great spider of\n      razor-blades flashing from his fingertips.\n\n      He leaps, but the girl leaps just as fast, a fierce jump,\n      that sends her out over black space and down into a huge, dark\n      sump of blackness.\n\n\n180E. EXT.  THE HEAVENS.  NIGHT.                                         180E.\n\n      CLOSE ANGLE ON NANCY as she curves like a swan though her\n      apogee, and begins falling, diving, planing through black air,\n      the wind ripping at her hair and eyes.  Suddenly the complex,\n      glittering skein of light that is the San Fernando Valley seen\n      from the air slides INTO FRAME, and we see she's falling from\n      high, high over the earth.\n\n      NANCY falls, falls in slow motion against the spinning lights,\n      free as a sky diver freefalling -- a giddy, acrophobic plunge.\n\n\n181,182,183,184 OMIT                                    OMIT 181,182,183,184\n\n185.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                            185.\n\n      NANCY crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just\n      outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched\n      and bloodied.  If she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass\n      of broken bones -- but somehow she's able to claw her way up and\n      look at her watch once more.\n\n      INSERT.  Just a few seconds from zero.\n\n      She staggers for her house's front door -- but a moment later\n      KRUEGER crashes down atop her!  NANCY struggles to her knees just\n      as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades.  But\n      instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes\n      him in a desperate bearhug!\n\n      The surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him\n      --and they fall into the jumble of torn-down trellis of roses\n      beneath her window.  Almost at that very second we HEAR the\n      jarring, deafening RINGING of NANCY's alarm clock!\n\n                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n\n\n186.  INT.  NANCY'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     186.\n\n      NANCY sprawls out of her bed onto the floor, twisting from the\n      jabs of the already vanished thorns, briars and brush.  Gasping,\n      she takes a second to get her bearings\n\n      ANGLE ON THE BED as she recovers quick as she can, snatching up\n      the net, ready for an assault from any direction.\n\n      But the room is empty.\n\n      Hardly able to catch her breath, her hair tangled, her nightgown\n      torn, she drops the net.  She sits on the bed, turns on the\n      bedside lamp and re-examines her room.  No one there but herself.\n\n      It's a terrible blow, despite the fact that she's safe.  Her face\n      is covered with tears, she's shaking and breathless.  She rattles\n      her head in confusion and despair, realizing her own madness.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I'm crazy after all...\n\n      At that very instant FRED KRUEGER leaps up from the far side of\n      the bed with an EXPLOSIVE SHOUT of rage!\n\n      He lunges across the table for her, missing by inches as NANCY\n      pitches backwards and scrambles for the window.  But she's\n      stopped by the bars.\n\n      KRUEGER, incredibly fast, regains his feet and leaps again -- the\n      girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head.  As he\n      crashes backwards NANCY flings open the door of her room and\n      dives through -- only to rebound off someone on the other side --\n\n\n187.  INT.  HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                                             187.\n\n      MARGE, knocked flying by NANCY'S charge, hits the floor hard,\n      knocking the wind out of herself.  NANCY sees what she's done,\n      jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt\n      home.  Next instant she gingerly ties a string to the door's\n      knob, a string that trails down from the ceiling, attached to\n      something up there that's still just barely out of sight.\n\n      Next instant she's dragging her MOTHER towards the woman's\n      bedroom as fast as she can.\n\n      KRUEGER is already splintering the doorway behind her as NANCY\n      dips and makes it into MARGE's room, SLAMMING the DOOR behind her\n      and locking it in a flash.\n\n      The MANIAC breaks the bolt and rips open the door.\n\n      But the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly\n      pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific\n      force.\n\n      CLOSE ANGLE ON THE CEILING.  The string jerks against a\n      single-edged razor, which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord\n      holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling.\n\n      WIDER as the thing falls free, pivoting at the hinge at the far\n      end of its handle, and drives straight into KRUEGER'S groin with\n      a terrific blow.  As he catapaults backwards with an incredulous\n      shriek, the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to\n      camera just what it is!\n\n      ANGLE DOWN ON KRUEGER, clawwing his way up despite his agony,\n      lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull.\n\n      WIDER ANGLE IN THE HALLWAY as KRUEGER roars out -- only to\n      immediately strike the length of WIRE strung across the hallway,\n      catching it just above the thigh.  He cartwheels head-over-heels\n      and lands flat on his back!\n\n      Instantly the DOOR to NANCY's MOTHER's bedroom flies open and\n      NANCY brings a brass lamp down over KRUEGER's head with all her\n      might!  It sounds like a line-drive caroming off a metal\n      flagpole.\n\n      NANCY SLAMS the DOOR as KRUEGER struggles up, clutching his\n      head.\n\n      Enraged, the huge man CRASHES against the door with terrific\n      force, and rears back and starts smashing against the door like\n      the utter homicidal lunatic that he is.\n\n                                                   CUT TO:\n\n\n188.  EXT.  ELM STREET/NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                             188.\n\n      HIGH ANGLE at the second floor level.  NANCY jerks open the\n      window to her MOTHER's bedroom and jams her face to the bars.\n      The AMBULANCE is pulling away with a tremendous WAIL of its SIREN\n      as NANCY SCREAMS down, trying to make herself heard.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Help!  Hey -- Daddy -- I got\n                      him trapped!  Where are you!?\n\n189.  ANGLE ON the street.  PARKER, assigned to guard the house, sees    189.\n      NANCY -- hair white, eyes wide -- pounding on the bars and\n      screaming like a lunatic.  But her meaning is utterly lost in the\n      noise of the ambulance next to him.\n\n                                      PARKER\n                              (yelling up at her)\n                      Everything's going to be all\n                      right!  Everything's under\n                      control!\n\n      ANGLE at the window.  Close on NANCY's face, incredulous at his\n      response.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Get my father, you asshole!\n\n      PARKER does a little take.  That almost sounded sane.\n\n                                      PARKER (OS)\n                      You heard what I said!  Now get\n                      back inside or I'll tell your\n                      dad!\n\n191.  Behind her the DOOR SPLINTERS.  NANCY whirls around just in time   191.\n      to see KRUEGER bull in!  NANCY's eyes go wide -- she's trapped\n      against the bars and has nowhere to go.  The man bunches his\n      knives into a single thick blade and rushes her, stabbing.  NANCY\n      closes her eyes --\n\n      Then from OUT OF FRAME Marge leaps between the two.\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      No!\n\n      She blocks the charge perfectly -- blocking the knives.\n      Both she and NANCY are slammed backwards against the bars\n      behind.\n      Drunk though she is, is hanging onto KRUEGER'S weapon hand,\n      keeping the knives inside herself, away from her daughter!\n\n                                      MARGE\n                      Nancy -- for god's sake's run!\n\n      But NANCY turns to the window instead, screaming for her father.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Daddy!

NIGHT.                                          192.\n\n      PARKER, just about to turn back to the business at GLEN's house,\n      sees NANCY and SOMEONE else fall just inside the window.\n      Something begins to dawn on the man.  Just a little.\n\n                                      PARKER\n                      Poor woman's got her hands full \n                      with that kid.  Maybe I better \n                      tell the lieutenant.\n\n      He turns and jogs towards GLEN's house.\n\n\n193.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     193.\n\n      ANGLE ON KRUEGER, hauling MARGE up in rage, knocking her\n      senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives\n      raised.  NANCY wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys\n      with her fists, spilling him back off the bed, then running past\n      him for the door.  She makes it to safety,\n      then turning back.  She flips the monster the bird, her eyes wild\n      with pain and fury.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Hey fuckface -- can't catch me!\n\n      The bait works -- KRUEGER leaves MARGE and howls after NANCY.\n\n\n194.

NIGHT.                                         195.\n\n      The girl careens down the stairs, across the room and to the\n      front door, banging against it with terrified fury.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (screaming)\n                      Come on -- he's in here!\n                      Daddy!

Daddyyyyyyy!!!!\n\n      KRUEGER, bloody and spewwing threats, staggers for her -- NANCY\n      dives behind the couch.\n\n      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S FEET as they hit another wire.\n\n      CLOSE ON the Lifesaver jerking out -- the clothespin snapping\n      together, completing the circuit with a CRACKLING SPARK.\n\n      WIDER ON THE EXPLOSION that rips out of the floor lamp next to\n      KRUEGER and knocks him sprawling across the room.\n\n      NANCY peeks out from behind the couch.  The man lies in a smoking\n      heap.  NANCY runs to the windows and screams out again.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      Hey -- Daddy!  Hey!

NIGHT.                                              197.\n\n      She careens down the stairs, throwing on the lights, the man\n      thundering after her.\n\n      ANGLE AT THE FAR END OF THE CELLAR.  NANCY brakes at the wall.\n      Nowhere left to hide.\n\n      THE SCRAPPING of the blades against brick turns her to see the\n      huge killer holding his knife-laden fingers up for her.\n\n                                      KRUEGER\n                      Ready for these?\n\n198.  ON NANCY -- she ducks behind the furnace -- comes out the other    198.\n      side with the big jug of gasoline and lets KRUEGER have it\n      straight over the head.  The heavy container shatters, showering\n      its contents over every square inch of the man.\n\n      He staggers backwards with a ROAR of fury, NANCY screaming after\n      him with a box of kitchen matches.  Before the man can realize\n      what she's up to, she ignites the whole box and throws it in\n      KRUEGER's face.\n\n      There's a blinding WHOOSH -- and KRUEGER goes up in a terrific\n      BALL OF FIRE.  Faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling\n      maniac and makes for the stairs, KRUEGER after her in full\n      pyrrhic rage.\n\n\n199.  INT.  NANCY'S KITCHEN.  NIGHT.                                     199.\n\n      NANCY holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment.\n      Just as the burning, blind monster tops the stairs, NANCY brings\n      the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a\n      great RINGING CONCUSSION.  It sends him windmilling backwards and\n      down the stairs in an ass-over-teakettle sprawl of sparks and\n      flames.\n\n      NANCY slams the door and throws the deadbolt home.\n\n      No sooner does she accomplish this than the man is SLAMMING again\n      and again against the door from the cellar.\n                           The terrible SCREAMS and CURSES PEAK,\n      THEN GROW WEAKER AND MORE GARBLED.  Then there's just silence.\n\n      NANCY staggers, half blind, from the kitchen.\n\n      As the room begins seething SMOKE from every pore, we\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n\n200.  INT.  GLEN'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                             200.\n\n      The CORONER steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber\n      gloves.  Pale and sweating.\n\n                                      CORONER\n                      Found you something, Donald.\n                      Should remind you of something...\n\n      The man shoves out his hand to LT THOMPSON.  THOMPSON stares at\n      it without touching it.  A long, thin steel blade, razor sharp,\n      attached to some sort of ring and armature -- broken off...\n\n\tThe CORONER gives a sweaty, grim smile.\n\n                                      CORONER (CONTD)\n                      Only place I ever heard of such\n                      a thing before was ten years\n                      ago.  Remember that fucker\n                      Fred Krueger?\n\n      LT THOMPSON has just knocked PARKER sprawling in his race to the\n      stairs.\n\n                                      PARKER\n                      Hey -- your daughter's acting \n                      kinda -- !\n                              (THOMPSON'S gone)\n                      Strange...\n\n\n201.  EXT.  NANCY'S HOME.  NIGHT.                                        201.\n\n      CRASH as NANCY breaks another window and presses against the\n      bars.  The house shudders and glows orange behind her.  She sees\n      her father bursting out the front door of Glen's house!\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      DAD!  GET US OUTTA HERE!\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      Oh, Jesus -- Nancy!\n                              (to his men)\n                      Hey!  We got a fire!\n\n202.  ANGLE ON NANCY'S FRONT DOOR.  Many MEN batter the door down as     202.\n      black smoke pours from the windows and NANCY's SCREAMS and SHOUTS\n      fill the air.  Within moments they've destroyed the door and LT\n      THOMPSON has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms.\n      But NANCY immediately fights free and darts right back to the\n      front door -- beckoning him to follow -- gesturing like a wild\n      woman.\n\n                                      NANCY \n                      I got him -- I got Fred Krueger!\n\n      THOMPSON stares at his wild little girl in astonishment, then\n      runs in after her.  The others follow, coughing and choking.\n\n\n203.  INT.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                         203.\n\n      THOMPSON collides with NANCY as she brakes, frozen.  THE SMOKE IS\n      BELCHING OUT OF THE CELLAR, but whoever was locked in there\n      certainly isn't now.  The door is flat on the kitchen floor.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      What the hell are you talking about,\n                      Nancy?\n\n      NANCY wheels without answering.  A series of tiny, isolated fires\n      burn across the living room and up the stairs.  Firesteps.\n\n                                      NANCY (CONTD)\n                      He's after Mom!  Come on!\n\n      She darts across the living room, following the flaming\n      footprints of FRED KRUEGER up the stairs before THOMPSON can stop\n      her.\n\n                                      LT THOMPSON\n                      NANCY!\n\n\n204.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     204.\n\n      NANCY STOPS IN THE SPLINTERED DOORWAY -- a ragged gold-red light\n      splashing her horrified face.\n\n205.  REVERSE IN HER POV -- FRED KRUEGER, literally a man of fire, has   205.\n      a screaming MARGE pinned to the bed and is crawling all over\n      her!  NANCY gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and\n      brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him.\n\n      By the time LT THOMPSON races into the room NANCY'S seized a\n      heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames.\n      The father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving\n      another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the\n      flames.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      He's under there!  Watch it!\n\n206.  THOMPSON pushes the girl back -- yanks out his .38 and pulls off   206.\n      the first cover.  No movement.  He pulls back a second one,\n      ready to fire.  But the only thing he sees is the blackened\n      half-skeleton of his ex-wife, smoking and seething and sinking\n      into the fluid-like mattress, sinking right down through it as if\n      she were sinking into a lake.  A blackened, gnarled hand goes\n      last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared.\n      And it's as if no one was ever there.\n \n      NANCY turns and looks at LT THOMPSON, her face white as her\n      ghostly hair.  THOMPSON shoves his .38 back in its holster and\n      finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely\n      manage.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      Now do you believe me?\n\n      PARKER barges in.  The room is filled with smoke, the bed is\n      stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.\n\n                                      PARKER\n                      You find him?\n                              (looking closer\n                               at THOMPSON)\n                      Sir?\n\n      LT THOMPSON just walks by him.  PARKER chases after.\n\n                                      PARKER (CONTD OS)\n                              (fading)\n                      Sir -- here, let me light that\n                      for you -- Lieutenant?  What \n                      happened?\n                              (gone)\n\n      WIDER, ON NANCY alone in the room.  She turns and looks at the\n      bed.  MUSIC slips in and builds.  The bed has changed color.\n      It's now an ash-darkened red and yellow.\n\n207.  CLOSER ON NANCY from the direction of the bed.  MUSIC SUDDENLY     207.\n      STOPS, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in\n      its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a\n      head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over NANCY.\n\n      Then FRED KRUEGER's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and\n      red mass -- and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops\n      through.\n\n      NEW ANGLE -- KRUEGER, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer,\n      clumps onto the floor between NANCY and the door.\n\n      NANCY falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a\n      strange, almost sublime transformation.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (quietly)\n                      I know you're there, Krueger.\n\n      She turns and faces him.\n\n                                      FREDDIE\n                      You think you was gonna get\n                      away from me?\n\n      NANCY shakes her head.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      I know you too well now,\n                      Freddie.\n\n      KRUEGER smiles bitterly.  Coming closer.\n\n                                      FREDDY\n                      And now you die...\n\n      There's a SLICKERING RATTLE at his side, and he raises the only\n      thing on him not charred -- the gleaming steel talons.\n\n208.  NANCY simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the    208.\n      end of her long, long tunnel.  And the way she says the words,\n      they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.\n\n                                      NANCY\n                      It's too late, Krueger.  I\n                      know the secret now -- this\n                      is just a dream, too -- you're\n                      not alive -- the whole thing\n                      is a dream -- so fuck off!\n                      I want my mother and friends\n                      again.\n\n      KRUEGER grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.\n\n                                      FREDDIE\n                      You what?\n\n                                      NANCY\n                              (even, firm)\n                      I take back every bit of\n                      energy I ever gave you.\n                      You're nothing.  You're\n                      shit.\n\n      And then she turns her back on him.  KRUEGER bunches his\n      fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and\n      raises his hand over the back of her head and neck.\n\n      NANCY closes her eyes and steps to the door.\n\n      CLOSE ON HER HAND, touching the door knob.\n\n      CLOSE ON KRUEGER'S KNIFE-FINGERS poised.\n\n      MUSIC BUILDS then SHRIEKS as KRUEGER stabs down, right through\n      NANCY -- as if she were an optical illusion -- loosing his\n      balance and falling down, down, down...  And he's gone.\n\n                                              CUT TO:\n\n\n209.  EXT.  ELM STREET.

WIDER ON NANCY as she walks to the curb.  The whole scene is       210.\n      wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog, bright yet diffuse.  We notice\n      that NANCY's house no longer has bars on its windows.  Then we\n      see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb, top down.  TINA\n      and ROD are in the back seat.  They all wave to MARGE as NANCY\n      climbs in.\n\n                                      GLEN\n                              (calling)\n                      You believe this fog?\n\n                                      MARGE\n                              (laughs)\n                      I believe anything's possible.\n\n      TINA slaps five with NANCY.\n\n                                      TINA\n                      Lookin' good, girl!\n\n      ANGLE INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE.  GLEN slips into the seat next to\n      NANCY.  Someone else is driving, it seems.  NANCY looks up to the\n      DRIVER.  The big MAN turns and grins at NANCY, a terrible,\n      scarred, hideous leer of a grin -- FRED KRUEGER'S grin!\n\n      ANGLE BACK OUTSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE as its top clamps over the\n      kids within -- a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast\n      and hard as a beartrap!  NANCY'S frightened face flies to the\n      window, pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away\n      from the curb and into the thick fog.\n\n211.
