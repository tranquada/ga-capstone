A huge BOILER ROOM is what it\n                 is, although we only glimpse it piecemeal.\n                 Then we SEE a MAN'S HAND, dirty and nail-bitten,\n                 reach INTO FRAME and pick up a piece of METAL.\n\n              -- ANOTHER ANGLE as the HAND grabs a grimey\n                 WORKGLOVE and slashes at it with a straight\n                 razor, until its fingertips are off.\n\n              -- CLOSE ON SAME HANDS dumping four fishing knives\n                 out of a filthy bag.  Their blades are thin,\n                 curved, gleaming sharp.\n\n              -- MORE ANGLES, EVEN CLOSER.  We can HEAR the MAN's\n                 wheezing BREATHING, but we still haven't seen\n                 his face.  We never will.  We just SEE more metal\n                 being assembled with crude tools, into some sort\n                 of linkage -- a splayed, spidery sort of apparatus,\n                 against a background light of FIRE, and a deep\n                 rushing of STEAM and HEAVY, DARK ENERGY.\n\n              -- And then we see this linkage attached to the glove.\n\n              -- Then the BLADES attached to all of it.\n\n              -- Then the MAN'S HAND slips into this glove-like\n                 apparatus, filling it out and transforming\n                 it into an awesome, deadly claw-hand with\n                 four razor/talons gleaming at its blackened\n                 fingertips.  Suddenly the HAND arches and STRIKES\n                 FORWARD, SLASHING THROUGH a DARK CANVAS, tearing\n                 it to shreds.\n\n\n1.    EXT.  LOS ANGELES.  NIGHT.  (2nd Unit)                             1.\n\n      A PULSATION OF LIGHT AND SHADOW.  MUSIC DROPS AWAY to a hushed\n      RUSHING OF WIND and DISTANT SIRENS.  CAMERA RACKS INTO FOCUS on a\n      HIGH PANORAMA of the San Fernando Valley, its night sky lit from\n      within by a strange GREENISH LIGHT.  TITLES BEGIN.\n\n      CAMERA TILTS DOWN and ZOOMS SWIFTLY into the valley's web of\n      light.\n\n<b>                                                CUT TO:\n</b>\n<b>     \n</b><b>2.    INT.  CONCRETE PASSAGEWAY.                                         2.\n</b>\n      TITLES CONTINUE as TINA GRAY, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin\n      night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor.  Her\n      steps quicken as TITLES appear in the portion of frame she leaves\n      free.\n\n      A subliminal COLLAGE of SOUND threads in and out of the MUSIC.\n      Distant insane LAUGHTER.  Slamming iron DOORS.  A bleating animal\n      CRY.  A LAMB, white and blank-faced, skitters across her path and\n      on into the dark.  No reason why it's there.\n\n      Then another SOUND, much nearer -- the slithering SCRAPE of\n      something like <u>fingernails</u> across slate.  It sets our teeth on\n      edge, twists the MUSIC, and sends TINA running.\n\n\n<b>3.    INT.

She\n      stops, listening intently as the SOUND of tiny hooves suddenly\n      turns into the rattle of DISTANT RAIN.\n\n      Then she hears RIPPING FABRIC.\n\n      Someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas,\n      approaching TINA.\n\n      CLOSER ON THE CANVAS.  The long curved fingerblades suddenly\n      punch through, flashing in the firelight, and begin ripping\n      through the thick fabric, as easily as scalpels through flesh.\n      They make a hideous, extended RIPPING SOUND.\n\n      TINA rushes away, hands over her ears.\n\n      ANOTHER ANGLE -- as the blinded girl stumbles backwards.  Then\n      the canvas flaps free.  The blades are gone.  The TITLES END, and\n      everything goes silent.\n\n      CAMERA CIRCLES until TINA's looking right into our eyes.  The\n      light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress,\n      leaving her naked and vulnerable.  Then a deep, ragged VOICE\n      whispers at her as CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HER FACE.\n\n<b>                                      VOICE (O.S.)\n</b>                      One two, Freddie's coming for\n                      you...\n\n      TINA opens her mouth to scream but only a dry, yellow dust pours\n      out.  And at that precise moment a huge shadowy MAN with a grimey\n      red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred\n      face lunges at her.  And it's <u>his</u> fingers that are tipped with\n      the long blades of steel, glinting in the boney light and giving\n      the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator.\n\n      TINA dodges away, her legs suddenly elephantine and slow.  The\n      MAN seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back.\n\n      The MUSIC shrieks as TINA manages to tear free -- the MAN lurches\n      after her with a hoarse SHOUT as we --\n\n<b>                                              SMASH CUT TO:\n</b>\n\n<b>4.

A MAN\n      hovers BACKGROUND.  TINA'S mother waves him away without looking,\n      shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes.  She appraises\n      her daughter.\n\n<b>                                      TINA'S MOTHER\n</b>                      Some dream, judging from that.\n\n      She nods at TINA's nightshift.\n\n      TINA looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill\n      penetrating it from the room.

Thinking.  We can just hear her HEART beating.  She\n      sighs and turns on her side.\n\n      Immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue,\n      with a broad yellow smear across its center.  All unseen by\n      NANCY, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's\n      beat.\n\n      CLOSE ON NANCY'S FACE.  She closes her eyes.\n\n<b>      ANGLE BACK UP ON THE CEILING JUST ABOVE HER HEAD.  SOMETHING\n</b>      presses against the surface from the inside.  The plaster buldges\n      out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing\n      pressing from inside -- <u>taking the shape of a man's face</u>.  The\n      face opens its mouth.  The knives rake through the surface.\n\n      ANGLE ON NANCY -- as plaster dust snows down on her.\n\n      She jerks awake, sitting bolt upright.

There are three parallel cuts\n      in the plaster there.  About eight inches long.  As if cut by\n      sharp knives.  Nothing else.\n\n      Back on NANCY.  She draws the covers around her and shivers.\n      Eyes wide open.\n\n\n<b>16.   EXT.  TINA'S HOUSE.  NIGHT.                                        16.\n</b>\n      Not a car or person in sight.

A\n      moment later a PEBBLE bounces off the pane.

Shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown.\n\n      A sharp crank of METAL, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of\n      an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals\n      noisily down.\n\n26.   LOW REVERSE ACROSS LID TO TINA.  Despite herself she comes over    26.\n      and touches it.  She comes up with long worms on her fingers.\n\n      Next moment the exact same shambling MAN from her nightmare\n      staggers into view fifty feet behind her.  TINA falls back into\n      the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion.  The\n      MAN turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his\n      right hand as he spreads his arms wide.  He starts scraping the\n      steel FINGERNAILS along a cinderblock wall.  Orange sparks spurt\n      out -- his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the\n      alley to the other -- and TINA is cut off from her home!\n\n      CLOSE ON HER as the SCRAPING of the blades gets louder and\n      closer.

WIDER ANGLE IN THE ALLEY -- a terrifying, all-out footrace         27.\n      between the girl and her pursuer.  The MAN is fast; the distance\n      between them closes with each heartbeat.  TINA overturns ashcans\n      -- claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a\n      window.  Ashen FACES appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and\n      disappear in fright.\n\n\n<b>28.   EXT.  TINA'S STREET.

In fact, the only response is for all the porch lights on\n      the block to be turned off.  The MAN roars out from behind a tree\n      -- a tree too narrow to have hidden him -- nearly upon the girl!\n      TINA runs in panic -- at last making her own home, only to be\n      trapped against its locked front door.\n\n      She hammers against its thick wood.\n\n<b>                                      TINA\n</b>                      Nancy!

He wears the same dirty\n      yellow sweater from the first nightmare -- from the wall-hanging\n      and blanket too -- and has the same sagging hat and leering grin\n      over his misshapen face.  And on his fingers are the steel\n      talons.\n\n29.   CLOSE ON HIM as he takes the blade on the end of his right index   29.\n      finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand.

He leers at TINA -- then suddenly lunges at her,\n      sweeping with his cutting hand!\n\n      TINA's no weak sister -- blocks his arm, deflecting the spines,\n      and grabs the MAN's ugly face with her other hand.  <u>But the face</u>\n      <u>only slides off to the bone</u>.  The MAN presses in, and TINA\n      contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder --\n      cutting her deeply.\n\n29A.  TINA staggers backward, GROANING, her foot now inexplicably        29A.\n      caught in bedclothes!  She falls over her bed's conformter, twists\n      away from the man and, like a child, pulls the cover over her!\n      The skull-faced MAN crushes down, and there's a fierce grappling\n      -- punctuated by his GRUNTS and the girl's DEAFENING SCREAMS --\n      and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter -- until\n      they're beneath it, fighting for life and death.\n\n\n<b>30.

Next instant, her\n      nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her\n      torso.  From no visible instruments!  A huge irrigation of blood\n      floods the bed.\n\n      Terrified, ROD dives for the light -- but at the same moment\n      something invisible grabs TINA, wielding her body in the air and\n      bringing it around in a swift blow that knocks ROD crashing into\n      the light -- smashing it to bits.\n\n31.

But just as she sees it, it tips and\n      pitches headlong through a doorway -- like some godawful rotten\n      tree finally timbering down.  She can hear the sickening\n      CRUNCHING of it falling down a long flight of stairs.\n\n      NANCY runs for it again.

NANCY turns to check\n      out the HALLGUARD.  She's vanished.  NANCY turns and looks down\n      through the open door.

Everything about the place feels\n      dreadfully wrong, and the MUSIC is deep into the NIGHTMARE THEME\n      when it pauses.\n\n      TIGHT ON NANCY.  Slow terror moves into her face.

Then from behind this, deeply\n      shadowed but still identifiable, steps TINA's KILLER.  The same\n      filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted\n      face twisting into a smile, the same GARBLED LAUGH as he slides\n      the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends\n      of his bony fingers.\n\n<b>                                      NANCY\n</b>                      Who <u>are</u> you?\n\n<b>                                      MAN\n</b>                      Gonna get you.\n\n57.

Ahead of her perhaps twenty-five feet, covered with a thick        90.\n      plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face, is\n      TINA.  Standing square in the middle of the street.  A dark ooze\n      of BLACK EELS roil out of its bottom, and at its top, the zipper\n      CHATTERS down and the greenish-white face of TINA lolls out.  She\n      gestures, supplicating, her watery eyes desperate to convey some\n      desperate message.\n\n      The MUSIC FALLS TO A HUSH.\n\n91.
