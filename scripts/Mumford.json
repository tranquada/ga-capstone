MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY\n\n               A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of \n               the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man \n               gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE \n               NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up \n               suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his \n               shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He \n               wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. \n               [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & \n               WHITE.]\n\n                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)\n                         I get outta the truck in this two-\n                         bit town.

BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling \n               picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO \n               RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.\n\n                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)\n                         ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- \n                         an angle.\n\n               He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, \n               then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.\n\n                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)\n                         I was thinking -- if it weren't for \n                         bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck \n                         at all...\n\n                                     LANDLADY (O.S.)\n                         Can I help you?\n\n               The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding \n               the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, \n               small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front \n               and clings with sweat to her generous curves.\n\n                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)\n                         Either my luck had just changed, or \n                         Fate just bought me another round of \n                         trouble.\n\n               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY\n\n               The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the \n               narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third \n               story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We \n               can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:\n\n                                     LANDLADY\n                         ...not very fancy... house needs \n                         repairs...

The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous \n               body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. \n               His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the \n               door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying \n               with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.\n\n                                     FOLLETT (V.O.)\n                         It couldn't 'a been any clearer what \n                         the set-up was. The next move was up \n                         to me...\n\n               The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction --\n\n                                     MUMFORD (V.O.)\n                         Don't tell me!\n\n               INT.

[The movie is now in COLOR.] \n               His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer \n               in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's \n               a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding \n               hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his \n               fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but \n               now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         I have eighteen more minutes!\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I don't want to hear any more today.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Why not?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't \n                         you?\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Well, I don't know...

LILY'S CAF\u00c9- DAY\n\n               Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, \n               crossing from the two-story building that houses his office \n               on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is \n               also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter \n               to pick up some take-out.

BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC\n\n               Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the \n               edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights \n               just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it \n               for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp \n               from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks \n               like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and \n               turns his head to watch the beam move about.\n\n               WE CUT BACK WIDE.

Right now he's \n               sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.\n\n               SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone \n               in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons \n               greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. \n               He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford \n               and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting \n               for his attention.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         Hi.\n\n               Mumford looks up, smiles.

Lionel is lying on the couch, \n               talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority \n               complex.

He snaps back to life and stares hard at \n               the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting \n               to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --\n\n                                     LIONEL\n                         ...which is no problem for me, because \n                         I remembered it was coming and I've \n                         attended every class, so I'm totally \n                         prepared.

Lily, the owner of the \n               restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the \n               greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees \n               Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around \n               Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         Doc.\n                              (doesn't look up)\n                         Ainge...\n\n               The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries \n               up the stairs.\n\n               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC\n\n               Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen \n               counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and \n               picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the \n               channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just \n               beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode -- \n               disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack \n               hosting.\n\n               CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole \n               show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the \n               show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the \n               bags.\n\n               INT. COOK'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY\n\n               Mumford is comparing different stepladders. MR. COOK, the \n               sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but \n               now --\n\n                                     COOK\n                         Dr. Mumford.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                              (doesn't really know \n                              him)\n                         Mr. Cook.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         Could you come with me please?\n\n               Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the \n               back.\n\n               BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat \n               of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand. \n               Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --\n\n                                     COOK\n                         I know I shoulda come to your office. \n                         I was gonna, actually, but then when \n                         you walked in here today...\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta \n                         problem.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         What's that?\n\n                                     COOK\n                         We're not sure.

Some \n                         of 'em are callin' it --\n                              (wants to get this \n                              right)\n                         -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest \n                         are callin' it...

Some people think \n                         it's all in their heads.\n                              (more intense)\n                         It's been so bad she's had to move \n                         back here to Mumford and live with \n                         us. And I'm not sure that's the best \n                         thing, either...\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Why's that?\n\n                                     COOK\n                         Oh... a lot of things. Several \n                         different factors. Will you see her, \n                         Doctor Mumford?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Sure.

She's in a \n                         mood. Do you ever go to somebody's \n                         house?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Generally that doesn't work out so \n                         well. It sends the wrong message to \n                         people who need to make a change.\n\n               Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But \n               he's worried.\n\n               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY\n\n               Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-\n               foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. \n               Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Hello, Lionel.\n\n                                     LIONEL\n                         You've got to have the right ladder \n                         for the job. You don't know what \n                         you're doing, you can get yourself \n                         in trouble.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         You're right, as usual. See you.\n\n               Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who \n               watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small \n               medical building.\n\n               INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, \n               vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her \n               thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, \n               listening.

He doesn't want to tell her the truth -- \n               everything.\n\n               EXT. BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and \n               beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the \n               outskirts of town.\n\n               INT. HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed \n               house. The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor, \n               is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked \n               everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling \n               their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some \n               hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered \n               housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If \n               it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything \n               can), it is here. Althea sounds very nervous, cheery.\n\n                                     ALTHEA\n                         -- sorry everything's in such an \n                         uproar.

REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a \n               spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an \n               elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford \n               toward.\n\n                                     ALTHEA\n                         I'm awful I know, but will you please \n                         help yourself. I just got a new copper \n                         sauciere from Williams-Sonoma and \n                         I'm afraid it'll be the death of us \n                         all if I don't get back in there...\n\n               She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford \n               gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees \n               something out there.\n\n               MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods \n               and down toward the house is a teenage boy.\n\n                                     KATIE (O.S.)\n                         You're the doctor, aren't you?\n\n               Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter \n               KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt \n               are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         You must be Katie. People call me \n                         Doc.\n\n                                     KATIE\n                              (motioning urgently)\n                         C'mere. Quick... c'mon!\n\n               Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the \n               porch.\n\n               INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance. \n               Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one \n               of two facing doors and waits for him.\n\n               When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for \n               safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in \n               closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is \n               packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons \n               that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless \n               move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing \n               door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was \n               once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of \n               cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.\n\n               Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks \n               in a hypnotic WHISPER --\n\n                                     KATIE\n                         Cuddledown... Linen & Lace...

REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN, \n               Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up \n               onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket \n               with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-\n               Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but \n               properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                         Is this him?\n\n                                     KATIE\n                              (nods)\n                         I showed him.\n\n                                     MARTIN\n                              (to Mumford)\n                         Do you get it now? This is no joke.\n\n               Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly, \n               their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that \n               Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has \n               come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late \n               arrival.\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         Hey, kids. Oh, hi.\n\n               Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his \n               hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his \n               Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. \n                         Jeremy Brockett.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Doc.

Have another drink, \n                         I'll be back in five.\n\n               Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with \n               each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.\n\n                                                               DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda \n               carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish \n               and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, \n               who immediately gets up.\n\n                                     ALTHEA\n                         I'll be back.\n\n               She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy \n               makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         I think you'll like this.

After exhaling a huge cloud of \n               smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         Makes the whole thing that much \n                         better.\n\n               Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He \n               gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to \n               light up --\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         Just hold the flame a little bit \n                         below the end... that's it... now \n                         just turn it slowly as you draw...\n\n               Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         Are you a man who likes to treat \n                         himself right?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I've had my moments.\n\n                                     JEREMY\n                         I am.

Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around \n               his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, \n               then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with \n               varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is \n               tiring for her, but she's committed.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         ...so we get on this incredible steam \n                         engine train that runs up into the \n                         mountains...\n                              (she tosses a paper, \n                              grunting)\n                         ...and this trip is everything it's \n                         cracked up to be... an open car, \n                         great views, the mountain air blowing \n                         through. We're sitting there, married \n                         for six years, and he says how he \n                         likes it better when I put my hair \n                         back...\n\n               Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all \n               her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, \n               who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         That wasn't so good.\n\n               Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips \n               the paper deftly onto the porch.

MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine \n               pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED \n               SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE \n               to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- \n               from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity \n               Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or \n               fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- \n               jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff \n               or anorexic, but always severely beautiful.

Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed \n               magazine on her chest.\n\n                                     NESSA\n                         I don't think you know what you're \n                         talking about.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Uh-huh.\n\n                                     NESSA\n                         This shrink school you went to... \n                         did you hear about it on an \n                         infomercial?\n\n               Mumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.\n\n                                     NESSA\n                         I want to live in the world these \n                         people are in.

It's when people \n                         start talking that everything goes \n                         to shit.\n\n               Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.\n\n                                     NESSA\n                         There's this kid at school...

But \n                         I know I don't like being watched. \n                         Nobody's ever paid any attention to \n                         what I did, and I liked it just fine. \n                         Where does he get off telling me I \n                         disrespect myself?\n                              (a beat)\n                         Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.\n\n               EXT. LILY'S CAF\u00c9, MAIN STREET - DAY\n\n               Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with \n               \"APPLEJACK TOURS\" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, \n               a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file \n               neatly into Lily's Caf\u00e9. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside \n               greeting them merrily.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         What's the deal?\n\n               Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered \n               sign in her front window -- \"Closed for Lunch. See you \n               tomorrow.\"\n\n                                     LILY\n                         They come through a few times each \n                         year.\n                              (greeting one cheerily)\n                         Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you \n                         again!\n                              (back to Mumford)\n                         It's a tour.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Where am I supposed to eat?\n\n                                     LILY\n                         You're on your own today, honey.\n\n               Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across \n               the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, \n               then back out there.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on \n               his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed \n               Mumford.\n\n                                     MUMFORD (O.S.)\n                         Hey, Skip!\n\n               Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, \n               barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily \n               skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-\n               flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. \n               Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         Doc.\n\n               Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately \n               distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited \n               to meet the local celebrity.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Lily, I want you to meet Skip.

Yeah, it's \n                         very nice... I heard your shower.\n\n               Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other \n               two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but \n               he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has \n               charmed her. Something's happening here.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         I've seen you going by on your board, \n                         but I didn't realize -- you're so \n                         young... to be so...\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         What?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         ...so rich?\n\n                                     LILY\n                              (gives him a look)\n                         ...so accomplished.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         I may be young, but Doc can tell \n                         you, I'm very immature.\n\n               He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're \n               all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches \n               the last of the tour enter the restaurant.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         So, is this like a Japanese \n                         restaurant?\n\n                                     LILY\n                         I'd better get in there.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         That's a lot of people all at once.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         It's okay.

Mumford makes a \n               \"what about me?\" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the \n               sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.\n\n                                     DELBANCO (O.S.)\n                         Dr. Mumford.\n\n               Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the \n               shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes \n               a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking \n               hands --\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Dr. Delbanco.

Mumford considers, trapped.\n\n               INT. THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY\n\n               The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler \n               are in a red leather booth. Sheeler listens with rapt, \n               admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --\n\n                                     DELBANCO\n                         ...annihilation anxieties engendered \n                         by bad experiences with a depriving \n                         mother... but no one can escape the \n                         fear of death. It is, as Henry James \n                         put it, \"the worm at the core.\" Try \n                         as we may to forget or ignore our \n                         mortality, James said --\n                              (theatrically)\n                         -- \"the skull will grin in at the \n                         banquet.\"\n\n               Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary \n               listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's \n               adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --\n\n                                     DELBANCO\n                         I've run on.

But that's \n               secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy \n               body framed in the doorway -- is having on him. She's been a \n               customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the \n               first time.

Her informal uniform, and all the other \n               details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif. \n               As they head down the main corridor --\n\n                                     SKIP (O.S.)\n                         Hey, Doc!\n\n               Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending \n               from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of \n               ramps designed for that purpose alone.

They approach a heavy steel door, the \n               entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits \n               at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area. \n               Skip shouts down there --\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         It's just me, Dino!\n\n               The old man nods, barely awake.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Skip, I've got a problem and I need \n                         some advice.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         You want my advice? Far out!\n\n               Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some \n               lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. \n               Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He \n               hesitates, suddenly concerned --\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         I hope nothing you're about to see \n                         will shake your faith in me.\n\n               Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open \n               far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind \n               them.\n\n               INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY\n\n               Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What \n               at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized. \n               Many different disciplines interface here:\n\n               THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some \n               incredibly life-like, anatomically correct, \n               sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect \n               them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends \n               from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a \n               huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.\n\n               THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens, \n               some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated \n               motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer \n               generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.\n\n               THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips, \n               limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber \n               vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.\n\n               THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make \n               rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer \n               designed.\n\n               All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high-\n               tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe, \n               picking up the odd item.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         Pretty creepy, huh?

But I'm very stoked.\n\n               Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by \n               an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic \n               section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         Doc, how I can be of help to you?\n\n               Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a \n               button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and \n               sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes \n               a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         Sorry...\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Wow.\n\n               Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford.\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         I'm here for you, Doc.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Skip, you know that it's improper -- \n                         completely unethical -- for a licensed \n                         psychologist to carry on a romantic \n                         relationship with one of his patients?\n\n                                     SKIP\n                         I guess that makes sense.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Yes, yes it does...\n\n               Mumford sinks into silence.

Sorry to have wasted your \n                         time with such...\n\n               She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco \n               is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the \n               doctor least wants to see.\n\n               INT. LILY'S CAF\u00c9 - DAY\n\n               Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily \n               busily working the midday rush. She sees him grinning at \n               her, but doesn't say anything for a while. Finally, blushing --\n\n                                     LILY\n                         Stop it! He's a kid.

LIVING ROOM, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's \n               thirtyish brother, BEN, are in there, watching television. \n               Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand, \n               muting the TV with a remote.\n\n                                     COOK\n                         Look who's here.

Used to work with \n                         her.

Excellent. Roxy.\n\n               Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other \n               two have not.\n\n               EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY\n\n               Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and \n               into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two \n               adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.\n\n               MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking \n               intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa \n               and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. \n               Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the \n               view is interrupted by a wall.\n\n               Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.\n\n               EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY\n\n               There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to \n               the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. \n               When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on \n               the metal screen.\n\n               INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n               Follett's private space is above and at the back of his \n               drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as \n               Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the \n               store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.\n\n               The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         What is it?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         It's a thought I had.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Should I open it now?\n\n               Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto \n               knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go \n               on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Let me just say something here... I \n                         have no idea if this is going to \n                         help.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         What exactly is it supposed to do?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         You remember when I asked you about \n                         pornography --\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         -- I find it degrading.

Still, \n                         there's some kind of imagery that's \n                         haunting you and, I think, getting \n                         in your way --\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         -- Which I don't necessarily agree.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         But you did come to me.\n\n               Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         My guess is these images were burned \n                         into your brain when you were young. \n                         Maybe if we could nail down the exact \n                         fantasies that are haunting you -- \n                         maybe you could get past them... \n                         Anyway, I thought we could try an \n                         experiment.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                              (indicating the box)\n                         And the experiment is in here?\n\n               Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         You know what?

I \n                         want to know what's in here.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                              (pulling on the box)\n                         There's absolutely no reason to think \n                         this is going to have any impact on \n                         you. I'm embarrassed to have --\n\n               Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession. \n               Loud --\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Hey! I agree with you that you don't \n                         know what you're talking about. That's \n                         what I've been saying all along. And \n                         I can guarantee you that looking at \n                         the Lost Ark or whatever you got in \n                         here is not going to mean diddly to \n                         me...\n                              (quieting down)\n                         ...but if you think I'm going to let \n                         you walk out of here without seeing \n                         what's in this box, you don't know \n                         much about Henry A. Follett.\n\n               Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe \n               to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with \n               much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett \n               carefully cuts open the package.\n\n               THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the \n               flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which \n               has been set a low-rent catalogue: \"METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES -- \n               Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia.\" Follett lifts away \n               the wrapping --\n\n               There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties \n               and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank, \n               Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag \n               Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative \n               illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors \n               Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video \n               tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW \n               CABIN.\n\n               We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands \n               shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very \n               soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear: \n               voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out \n               of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous \n               businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters, \n               and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the \n               erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.\n\n               SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized, \n               galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a \n               tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes \n               from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing \n               that could wreck his mood now, is --\n\n                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST (O.S.)\n                         Mr. Follett --\n\n               Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young \n               Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams \n               everything back into the box as best he can and tries to \n               cover it.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         What?! What the hell is so important \n                         I can't have five minutes --?\n\n               The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the \n               room.\n\n                                     YOUNG PHARMACIST\n                         It's her, sir. You told me to get \n                         you when she came to pick up her \n                         prescription.\n\n               It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does, \n               his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist \n               with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to \n               Mumford.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to...\n                              (indicates box)\n                         ...I really appreciate what you're \n                         trying to... uh, I can't thank you \n                         enough for...\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         My pleasure.\n\n               Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to \n               check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         I'll see you on... whatever...\n\n               He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks \n               down through the one-way mirror.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription \n               counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she \n               looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and \n               begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett \n               motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He \n               comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea \n               something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back \n               against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in \n               Follett's first fantasy.\n\n               Mumford reacts, bemused.\n\n               EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY\n\n               Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite \n               her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous \n               progress since we first saw her.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         When I was in high school we used to \n                         come up here and make out.

She was so horrible, \n                         you decided you couldn't desert me.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I thought only action movies had \n                         villains like that.\n\n               Sofie gestures ahead.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         That's the cut-off, isn't it?\n                              (Mumford nods)\n                         I know why you were going to quit \n                         seeing me.\n\n               Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the \n               woods.\n\n               EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY\n\n               Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she \n               steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of \n               her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle \n               herself.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         You feel like a fake, an imposter...\n\n               Mumford looks up, sharply.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         ...as if maybe you don't know what \n                         you're doing.\n\n               She puts a hand on his arm.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Everybody feels that way sometimes... \n                         like we're not who we're supposed to \n                         be. But I have to tell you, Dr. \n                         Mumford --\n\n               He winces at her formality.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         -- you've been a tremendous help to \n                         me.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Yeah?\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         I can't tell you how much I admire \n                         you.

Mumford's \n               glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the \n               end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets \n               up.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I'm very happy for you, Henry.\n\n               Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it \n               vigorously.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I feel like we're making real progress \n                         here.\n\n                                     FOLLETT\n                         Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you \n                         what that package meant to me --\n\n               Mumford stops him with a \"don't mention it\" gesture. Follett \n               accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone \n               still wants to use that door.\n\n               Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers \n               when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not \n               expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office \n               door and opens it.\n\n               Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. \n               She peers past him to see if he's alone.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can \n                         I come in?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Of course.\n\n               Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing \n               her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         We haven't met in this office since \n                         that first time. This is how a real \n                         professional and his client are \n                         supposed to see each other.\n\n               Mumford waits.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         It might've been more appropriate if \n                         we had followed a traditional approach \n                         to the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Is something wrong, Sofie?\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. \n                         Mumford.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         You're upset.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         How intuitive! That must take years \n                         of training right there. Maybe you \n                         can guess what has upset me.\n\n               Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing \n               through his mind. Finally, carefully --\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Is it something you've heard about \n                         me?\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         No, it is not something I've heard \n                         about you! It is someth--\n                              (stops suddenly)\n                         Why? Is there something I should \n                         have heard about you?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Why don't you tell me what's on your \n                         mind?\n\n               Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she \n               looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the \n               couch --\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         May I?\n\n               Mumford gestures \"of course.\" Sofie swings her legs up and \n               lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's \n               face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) \n               This seems to help Sofie a bit.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         All right... I'm going to come right \n                         out and say this, because that's \n                         what your shrink is for, right, so \n                         you can tell him what's bothering \n                         you?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Um-huh.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                              (tone still rough)\n                         First of all, I have been feeling \n                         much better lately. I don't know if \n                         the syndrome is over -- if it's just \n                         run its course or something -- but I \n                         feel a hundred per cent better than \n                         when I first came to you.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I'm glad.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Given that, I'm obviously not going \n                         to be judging things in the most \n                         realistic way.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I don't follow you.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                              (sharply)\n                         I'm saying that since I'm doing so \n                         much better -- which I attribute to \n                         you -- I'm liable to misinterpret \n                         some of my feelings.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                              (tentative)\n                         Okay...\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         The point is this -- I am not a blank \n                         page. I did not just fall off the \n                         turnip truck. Do you know what I \n                         mean?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I think so.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         I know a little about psychology. I \n                         took three different courses in \n                         college. It's true, none of them \n                         were above the two hundred level, \n                         but I took them... And there was one \n                         concept I remember very well.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         What was that?\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Transference!\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Transference.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Yes, and that is what I have got \n                         right now. I have taken my feelings \n                         of gratitude... and relief... and \n                         transferred them onto... you. I have \n                         taken all those warm, grateful \n                         emotions and confused them with \n                         feelings for you... So that now I am \n                         under the delusion...\n                              (a deep breath)\n                         ...that I am in love with you.\n\n               Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence \n               in the room. Sofie does not look back there.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Hello?\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Hello.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         I think you can understand why I \n                         have some serious questions about \n                         your methods. I mean, obviously it \n                         becomes much more likely that I'm \n                         going to have confusion about this \n                         when your idea of treatment is to go \n                         walking in the woods and up to make-\n                         outs-ville and do all these highly \n                         romantic activities --\n\n               Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but \n               refuses to acknowledge it.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         -- We had a paper route together, \n                         for godssake! Do you understand how \n                         I might be a little resentful? Knowing \n                         that this so-called \"love\" I'm feeling \n                         is totally bogus, and just a pathetic \n                         case of... transference?\n\n               Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Yes.\n\n               Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back \n               of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, \n               but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.\n\n                                     SOFIE\n                         Maybe you ought to think about how \n                         you're going to fix this. And when \n                         you do...\n                              (suddenly losing her \n                              will)\n                         ...please get back to me.\n\n               Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a \n               step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.\n\n               EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC\n\n               Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into \n               the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front \n               yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         Hey, Ainge.\n\n               Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the \n               garden.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         Doc...\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                              (keeps walking)\n                         Lily.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         Doc.\n\n               Mumford reluctantly stops.

That's tough, I mean it. \n                         I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says \n                         you're in love.\n\n               Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.\n\n                                     LILY\n                         Then it's worth it.\n\n               Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the \n               fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over \n               to her side.\n\n                                     MUMFORD\n                         I'll tell her tonight.\n\n               Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.\n\n               INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC\n\n               Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange \n               juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. \n               Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter \n               and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares \n               inside.\n\n               UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a \n               story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from \n               Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near \n               Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented \n               delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied \n               by appropriate footage:\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         ...A drug rehabilitation center in \n                         the lonely southwestern desert... \n                         run by reclusive monks... becomes \n                         the point of departure in a mysterious \n                         vanishing...\n\n               A CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture \n               of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. \n               His name is not visible.\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         ...as an intrepid government \n                         investigator disappears -- without a \n                         trace.\n\n               In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:\n\n               LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters, \n               etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from \n               Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like \n               Mumford playing him.\n\n               IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly, \n               it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently, \n               lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up. \n               When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the \n               hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa \n               cushion.\n\n               ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's \n               version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses -- \n               are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         ...despite brilliant promise as a \n                         fearless investigator... found himself \n                         on a downward spiral of drug abuse \n                         and dissolution...\n\n               MUMFORD'S SISTER, the real thing, a plain, middle-aged West \n               Virginia woman, appears in a \"dramatic\", badly-lit interview. \n               (As with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered \n               title.)\n\n                                     MUMFORD'S SISTER\n                         ...we didn't talk much after our \n                         folks died, but I know he felt his \n                         life had taken a wrong turn...\n\n               A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for \n               a flash. Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his \n               neck encircled by Gregory's arm. Candy is on the other side \n               of Gregory.\n\n               A shot of the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a State Police Cruiser \n               zips by.\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         His former undercover partner at the \n                         IRS... is now a trooper with the \n                         Pennsylvania State Police...\n\n               GREGORY, in State Police uniform, with a sadistic glint in \n               his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by.\n\n                                     GREGORY\n                         The guy was obsessed... didn't always \n                         know where to draw the line... but I \n                         would have trusted him with my wife -- \n                         er, my life --\n                              (looks off camera, \n                              laughing)\n                         -- What'd I say?

He's polite, but not \n               cooperative.\n\n                                     BROTHER TIMOTHY\n                         We don't talk about the people who've \n                         been our guests... but I can tell \n                         you this about our order -- we believe \n                         everybody has the right to start \n                         over... everybody deserves a second \n                         chance.\n\n               Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway.\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         And perhaps... that is exactly the \n                         chance the now-sober pilgrim took... \n                         on a blustery November day... walking \n                         away from the rehab center... never \n                         to be heard from again...\n\n               MUMFORD'S SISTER AGAIN:\n\n                                     MUMFORD'S SISTER\n                         I'd like to know if he's alive.

A 1-800 telephone number appears across \n               the bottom of the frame.\n\n                                     ROBERT STACK\n                         If you have any information about \n                         this man or know anything about his \n                         whereabouts, contact the Sheriff's \n                         Department in Cochise County, Arizona, \n                         or call this number...\n\n               EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of \n               Mumford.\n\n               WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape, \n               one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV \n               light.\n\n               EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT\n\n               MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In \n               fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of \n               breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the \n               doorbell, and waits.\n\n               Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially \n               sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.\n\n                                     MRS.
