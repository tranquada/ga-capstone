TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1\r\n\r\n\r\n           -EARLY APRIL, 1841-\r\n           We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A\r\n\r\n           FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.\r\n\r\n           WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high\r\n           end piece, but it is quite nice.\r\n\r\n           WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair\r\n           with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late\r\n           twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,\r\n           is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.\r\n           Someone who has known manual labor in his time.\r\n\r\n           Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing\r\n           the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to\r\n           play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\n           INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING\r\n\r\n           We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being\r\n           thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In\r\n           attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are\r\n           FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women\r\n           are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense\r\n           that for the most part they are people of means.\r\n\r\n           The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At\r\n           the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a\r\n           REEL.\r\n\r\n           The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,\r\n           having cut directly from the tune he was previously\r\n           playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no\r\n           way seems possessed with empty servitude.\r\n\r\n           Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into\r\n           enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal\r\n           thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear\r\n           that despite their respective races there is much\r\n           admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\n           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING\r\n\r\n           It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is\r\n           ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We\r\n           see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and\r\n           ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed\r\n           kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          2.\r\n\r\n                         3 CONTINUED: 3\r\n           she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if\r\n           preparing to pose for a portrait.\r\n           They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.\r\n           He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY\r\n           stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,\r\n           he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his\r\n           greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and\r\n           well and provided for. He goes to his children, and\r\n           hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss\r\n           on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n\r\n           EXT. STREET - DAY\r\n\r\n           Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets\r\n           and groves of Saratoga.\r\n\r\n           The streets are well populated this morning with many\r\n           people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are\r\n           BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly\r\n           easily - though not always completely - with the whites.\r\n           We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their\r\n           WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south\r\n           and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are\r\n           not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are\r\n           well dressed and \"leading apparently an easy life\" -\r\n           comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.\r\n\r\n           As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an\r\n           intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart\r\n           traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the\r\n           muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for\r\n           Solomon to help her across.\r\n\r\n                          ANNE\r\n           Solomon...\r\n           Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile\r\n           waving her forward:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Come, Anne. Jump.\r\n\r\n           The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on.\r\n\r\n                          ALONZO MARGARET\r\n           Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make\r\n           it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          ANNE\r\n           I will not ruin my dress. Catch\r\n           me!\r\n\r\n           Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's\r\n           still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne\r\n           gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon\r\n           replies.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          3.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           I will catch you, Anne.\r\n\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           I will.\r\n           Again, lightly stern:\r\n\r\n                          ANNE\r\n           You will.\r\n\r\n           And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,\r\n           swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to\r\n           the delighted applause of the children. That done,\r\n           Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.\r\n\r\n           As Solomon and his family make their way, among the\r\n           slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.\r\n           As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon\r\n           and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of\r\n           this most handsome and harmonious group should be\r\n           obvious.\r\n\r\n           With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the\r\n           STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.\r\n           Suddenly a voice barks out-\r\n\r\n           A VOICE (O.S.)\r\n           Jasper! Come on!\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n           INT. STORE - LATER\r\n\r\n           We are inside the store of MR. CEPHAS PARKER; a white man\r\n           and a supplier of general goods. Solomon greets him\r\n\r\n                          WITH:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Mr. Parker.\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.\r\n\r\n           With money in hand the Northup children move quickly\r\n           about the store looking for items to purchase.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          CONTINUED:\r\n\r\n\r\n           Anne looks over some silks and fabrics. Parker suggests\r\n\r\n                          TO SOLOMON:\r\n\r\n                          PARKER (CONT'D)\r\n           A new cravat, Solomon?

Children, come\r\n           see what your father has just\r\n           purchased for me.\r\n           As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the\r\n           new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered\r\n           the store.\r\n           At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY\r\n           HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the\r\n           book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           If you would sign our condolence\r\n           book. My hope is to find a way to\r\n           forward it to the Widow Harrison.\r\n           Sad days for the nation.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Yes, certainly. Poor Mrs. Harris\r\n           and her children.

It's as though he'd like to\r\n           engage, but is unsure of as to how. Noting Jasper, Parker\r\n\r\n                          SAYS:\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           A moment, sir, and you will be\r\n           assisted.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           If we could discuss the price...\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          5.\r\n\r\n                         5 CONTINUED: (3) 5\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

It is a cold glare as\r\n           though he wasn't speaking to, and has no interest in a\r\n           response from a black man. Looking back to Parker:\r\n\r\n                          FITZGERALD\r\n           Good day, sir.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         6 6\r\n\r\n           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/DINING ROOM - EVENING\r\n\r\n           Anne, busy in the kitchen, puts the final touches to the\r\n           meal, which is just about to begin. Solomon, in the\r\n           meanwhile, sits at the head of the table reading from a\r\n           NEWSPAPER. He reads to his children solemn news of the\r\n           funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President\r\n           Harrison.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           \"Thus has passed away from earth\r\n           our late President.\"\r\n           Solomon starts from the top of the article.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)\r\n           \"During the morning, from sunrise,\r\n           the heavy bells had been pealing\r\n           forth their slow and solemn toll\r\n           while the minute guns announced\r\n           that soon the grave would receive\r\n           its trust.

WASHINGTON - DAY 18\r\n\r\n           The city is a swarm of people. At the moment the populace\r\n           is displaying both sorrow and anticipation. Sorrow for\r\n           the loss of the President. Many are dressed in black,\r\n           and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere. Black armbands\r\n           are frequently seen, and the occasional American Flag\r\n           hung at half mast. As well, there are portraits of\r\n           Harrison at varying locations.\r\n           Having arrived in Washington, Solomon, Hamilton and Brown\r\n\r\n           RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         19 19\r\n\r\n           INT.

He crosses to, and BLOWS OUT A\r\n           CANDLE. The room goes dark with a blackness more than\r\n           night. Brown and Hamilton exit. Solomon lays in the\r\n           dark and moans.

He finds himself in a nearly lightless\r\n           room about twelve feet square with walls of solid\r\n           masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small\r\n           window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only\r\n           furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box\r\n           stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are\r\n           CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and\r\n           his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But\r\n           that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.\r\n           He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He\r\n           does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails\r\n           about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and\r\n           beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams\r\n           without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his\r\n           flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.\r\n           After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,\r\n           slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed\r\n           state he remains.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         25 25\r\n\r\n           INT. BURCH'S DUNGEON - MORNING\r\n\r\n           Solomon again awakens. He hears sounds beyond the\r\n           door...footsteps. Eventually the door opens. Enter\r\n           JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER\r\n           RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer.\r\n           As the door opens, this is the first light to seep into\r\n           the otherwise near-black room. The shine is painful to\r\n           Solomon's eyes. With no salutation whatsoever, Burch\r\n\r\n                          ASKS:\r\n\r\n                          BURCH\r\n           Well, my boy, how yah feel now?\r\n           Solomon rises up as best he can. With all the resolve he\r\n           can put together he states what he considers to be fact:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           I am Solomon Northup. I am a free\r\n           man; a resident of Saratoga, New\r\n           York. The residence also of my\r\n           wife and children who are equally\r\n           free. I have papers. You have no\r\n           right whatsoever to detain me--\r\n\r\n                          BURCH\r\n           Yah not any--\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           And I promise you - I promise -\r\n           upon my liberation I will have\r\n           satisfaction for this wrong.\r\n\r\n                          BURCH\r\n           Resolve this. Produce your\r\n           papers.\r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          17.\r\n\r\n                         25 CONTINUED: 25\r\n           With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his\r\n           trousers. He searches one, then the other, but they are\r\n           empty. He feels quickly about himself, but clearly his\r\n           papers have been lifted. Solomon's confidence shifts,\r\n           but to resolve rather than fear. Papers or none, he will\r\n           not be easily cowed. Still, Burch asserts:\r\n\r\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah no free man. And yah ain't\r\n           from Saratoga. Yah from Georgia.\r\n           A moment. Not a word spoken among the trio, but Solomon\r\n           and Burch do some serious eye fucking, neither man\r\n           yielding. Burch says again:\r\n\r\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah ain't a free man. Yah nuthin'\r\n           but a Georgia runaway.\r\n           Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce. Solomon does not\r\n           in any way. Both men exchange a long and daring stare.\r\n           The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off. Burch,\r\n           leans to Radburn, SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT\r\n\r\n           DISTINGUISH.\r\n           Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of\r\n           \"instruments:\" a PADDLE - the flattened portion, which is\r\n           about the size in circumference of two open hands, and\r\n           bored with a small auger in numerous places. He also\r\n           carries a WHIP. A cat-o-nine tails; a large rope of many\r\n           strands. The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the\r\n           extremity of each. Burch says again:\r\n\r\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia.\r\n           Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism. He will say\r\n           nothing of the kind.\r\n           As that is the case, Solomon is seized by both men. He is\r\n           pulled over the bench, face downward, shirt still on his\r\n           back. Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS, holding Solomon\r\n           down in a bent position.\r\n           With no preamble, Burch begins to beat Solomon about the\r\n           back with the paddle. Burch strikes him wordlessly - no\r\n           taunting, no sneering. Solomon screaming against each\r\n           blow. His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND\r\n\r\n           BRUISES.\r\n           This beating continues on and on and on until quite\r\n           literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort.\r\n           Dripping in sweat and panting:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          18.\r\n\r\n                         25 CONTINUED: (2) 25\r\n\r\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah still insist yah a free man?\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           ...I...I insist...\r\n           Burch regrets hearing this. Not from sympathy, but\r\n           rather because he's nearly too tired to go back to\r\n           beating Solomon. Yet, as if returning to work, Burch\r\n           returns to pummeling Solomon. Burch punctuates the blows\r\n\r\n                          WITH:\r\n\r\n                          BURCH\r\n           Yah a slave. Yah a Georgia slave!\r\n           Burch continues to strike, and strike... This time until\r\n           the paddle SNAPS IN HALF. Burch then GRABS THE WHIP.\r\n           Hardly missing a stroke, he whips Solomon relentlessly,\r\n           the flails cutting into Solomon's back. Again, Burch's\r\n           arm tires before Solomon \"breaks.\"\r\n\r\n                          BURCH (CONT'D)\r\n           Are yah slave?\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           ...No...\r\n           Burch goes back to whipping and whipping, and whipping...\r\n\r\n           SOLOMON'S BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND\r\n           OOZING WITH BLOOD. Finally Burch can whip no more. He\r\n           pours sweat and sucks air, leaving himself just enough\r\n           energy to take up his instruments and EXIT. Radburn\r\n           lingers for a moment. He takes the irons off Solomon's\r\n           legs. Opens the window some. As he makes these\r\n           gestures, in a patronizing and confidential manner, one\r\n           wrought with poor sincerity::\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN\r\n           I seen a good many of the black\r\n           kind just where yah're. Sick.\r\n           Make me sick. Often times the\r\n           situation was resolved, and I\r\n           think; what was all the beatin'\r\n           and abuse for? Things end as they\r\n           should, and the violence was for\r\n           naught. So why cause trouble when\r\n           they ain't no cause for it? Be of\r\n           a cooperative nature, and things\r\n           don't need be particularly\r\n           unpleasant.\r\n\r\n                          (BEAT)\r\n           Or, yah can carry on like yah\r\n           been, and I fear yah won't live to\r\n           see Sunday next.\r\n           With that thought, Radburn exits. Solomon rests. But to\r\n           rest seems like giving in to defeat. He begins pulling\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          19.\r\n\r\n                         25 CONTINUED: (3) 25\r\n           on his chains. But for all his struggling, the chain\r\n           loosens none. Solomon calls out:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Help me! Someone help me!\r\n           If anyone at all hears him, they do not respond.

BURCH'S DUNGEON/YARD - DAY 30\r\n\r\n           It is a yard just beyond Burch's. The yard is hemmed in\r\n           by a brick wall. In the yard are two men, and a boy.\r\n           The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age.\r\n           He is well educated. JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years\r\n           old. He is born and bred a slave, is lacking in\r\n           education, and overwhelmed with fear of the situation.\r\n           Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who\r\n           answers to the name of Randall.\r\n           Solomon, Clemens Ray, John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED.\r\n           Though they try to cover their privates a bit, they are\r\n           all aware of the uselessness of modesty. Radburn is\r\n           present. He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD\r\n           WATER. He throws water on the naked men.\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN\r\n           Go on. Warsh up.\r\n           The men, soaking in humility as well as water, begin to\r\n           scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them.\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN (CONT'D)\r\n           The boy, too. Get him clean.\r\n           Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall.\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN (CONT'D)\r\n           Scrub now. Git 'em clean.\r\n           Solomon scrubs harder. Randall - clearly cold and\r\n           uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon.\r\n\r\n                          RANDALL\r\n           Do you know when my Mama will\r\n           come?\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN\r\n           Hush him up!\r\n           Seeing Solomon has no answer for him, Randall begins to\r\n           cry.\r\n\r\n                          RANDALL\r\n           Mama ..!

Be silent!\r\n           On the seeming strength of Solomon's promise, Randall\r\n           goes silent. Solomon looks to Radburn, who just throws\r\n           water on the soapy men.\r\n\r\n          22.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         31 OMITTED 31\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          A32 INT.

Radburn also has a SHIRT.\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN\r\n           That old thing of yours is just\r\n           rags and tatters.

Put it on.\r\n           With slow defiance, Solomon does as instructed. He\r\n           removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was\r\n           wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one\r\n           Radburn brought him. The shirt's ill-fitting and dirty.\r\n           Despite that, Radburn says:\r\n\r\n                          RADBURN (CONT'D)\r\n           There. Tha's fine.

As usual, he\r\n           calls out for his \"Mama.\" By now, however, his calls\r\n           should feel like little more than background noise.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           This can't stand.

This is reflected in her airs and\r\n           her speech. The other is a little girl, light in skin\r\n           color, of about seven or eight. This is EMILY, Randall's\r\n           half sister.\r\n           As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight,\r\n           then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy.

He bends \r\n           down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her \r\n           face. \r\n           Solomon rouses, and looks across to witness the scene. \r\n           From his vantage point, we see Eliza stand to interrupt \r\n           the Sailor. The Sailor looks at Eliza, Eliza looks back \r\n           at him. Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the \r\n           hold. \r\n           As she does so, Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand \r\n           between Eliza and the Sailor. Stretching out a firm hand \r\n           to the sailor's shoulder, Robert's look says \"No you \r\n           don't.\" \r\n           Clemens Ray is awake now, watching. \r\n           There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor \r\n           and Robert, an impasse. \r\n           We focus on the Sailor's face. Slowly, a greasy smile \r\n           erupts upon it. Back now to Robert's face, a look of \r\n           incomprehension. \r\n           Robert looks down. We follow his gaze to the knife that \r\n           has already been jabbed unseen between Robert's ribs. \r\n           The sailor withdraws the bloody blade. \r\n           A wide shot of the two men. Robert collapses to the \r\n           floor like a sack of potatoes. \r\n           Clemens Ray and Solomon react.

These are humans held in strict bondage -\r\n           herded like cattle, chained together as if in a \"chain\r\n           gang.\" Slaves are evident not merely by the color of\r\n           their skin.

Mistress Ford is\r\n           present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to\r\n           them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by\r\n           way of compassion.\r\n\r\n                          FORD\r\n           \"But as touching the resurrection\r\n           of the dead, have ye not read that\r\n           which was spoken unto you by God,\r\n           saying, I am the God of Abraham,\r\n           and the God of Isaac, and the God\r\n           of Jacob. God is not the God of\r\n           the dead, but of the living. And\r\n           when the multitude heard this,\r\n           they were astonished at his\r\n           doctrine. Then one of them, which\r\n           was a lawyer, asked him a\r\n           question, tempting him, and\r\n           saying, Master, which is the\r\n           great commandment in the law?\r\n           Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt\r\n           love the Lord thy God with all thy\r\n           heart, and with all thy soul, and\r\n           with all thy mind. This is the\r\n           first and great commandment. And\r\n           the second is like unto it, thou\r\n           shalt love thy neighbor as\r\n           thyself.

As they lunch Solomon\r\n           reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           But he that is greatest among you,\r\n           let him be as the younger; and he\r\n           that is chief, as he that doth\r\n           serve.

But I am among you as he\r\n           that serveth.\r\n           A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound\r\n           of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over.

Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings\r\n           the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road\r\n           ahead of them.\r\n           Standing in the middle of the road is a group of\r\n           CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their \"usual\" dress of\r\n           buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic\r\n           colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them\r\n           DOGS and HORSES.

As\r\n           well the group share a smoke on a pipe.\r\n           One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an \"INDIAN\r\n           FIDDLE.\" The Chickasaws perform a customary dance;\r\n           trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a\r\n           guttural, sing-song noise.\r\n           The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon\r\n           particularly taken by the music...if not entirely\r\n           enthralled by it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          46.\r\n\r\n                         73 CONTINUED: 73\r\n           After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the\r\n           group.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74\r\n\r\n           Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the\r\n           river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO\r\n           DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing\r\n           waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a\r\n           thought far greater than relieving himself has come to\r\n           him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants.\r\n           Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were\r\n           a man possessed.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         75 75\r\n\r\n           EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY\r\n\r\n           Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as\r\n           Tibeats listens.

It's all just\r\n           a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic\r\n           to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the\r\n           slaves go at it like they've got something to prove.

He is alone other than Rachel and\r\n           Mistress Ford who, shocked by that which she witnesses,\r\n           runs out to the field to fetch Chapin. Solomon's\r\n           instinct is to run, but he stands his ground as Tibeats\r\n           marches back whip in hand.\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\r\n           Strip yer clothes!\r\n           Solomon does no such thing.\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\r\n           Strip!\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           I will not.\r\n           With \"concentrated vengeance,\" Tibeats springs for\r\n           Solomon, seizing him by the throat with one hand and\r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          55.\r\n\r\n                         84 CONTINUED: (2) 84\r\n           raising the whip with the other. Before he can strike\r\n           the blow, however, Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar\r\n           of his coat and pulls him in close. Reaching down,\r\n           Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back\r\n           with the other hand. Tibeats tumbles to the ground. A\r\n           violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to\r\n           Tibeats throat, and then in a frenzy of madness snatches\r\n           the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the\r\n           handle again and again and again.\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS\r\n           Yew will not live ta see another\r\n           day, nigger!

The stiff stock of the whip wraps around\r\n           Tibeats's cringing body until Solomon's arm aches.\r\n           Tibeats's cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and\r\n           then pleas for mercy:\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS (CONT'D)\r\n           Murder!

A long moment, Solomon stands alone. He\r\n           looks around, not sure what to do; to stay or to flee.\r\n           Anxiety mounts on his features.\r\n           A moment more, and Tibeats EXITS the house. He saddles\r\n           his horse and rides off to beat the devil. Or, worse, to\r\n           fetch him.\r\n           Chapin comes running back out of the house. He is\r\n           visibly excited, and when he speaks he is quite earnest.\r\n           Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off\r\n           an air of impending trouble.\r\n\r\n                          CHAPIN\r\n           Do not stir.

The two converse at a\r\n           distance from Solomon, then they head off for the log\r\n           kitchen.\r\n           Solomon is now very much alone, and he waits for what is\r\n           to come. AND WE WAIT WITH HIM. And we wait, and we\r\n           continue to wait... Moment by moment, the dread of the\r\n           unexpected mounts.\r\n           Solomon's eyes begin to well. He has beaten a white man,\r\n           and he knows that death awaits him.\r\n\r\n           A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS\r\n           THROAT, but he is too choked up to fully speak it.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          57.\r\n\r\n                         84 CONTINUED: (4) 84\r\n           Chapin has now returned to the piazza.

It's Tibeats.\r\n           He returns with two accomplices; RAMSAY and COOK. They\r\n           carry with them large whips and a coil of rope.\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS\r\n           Tha's the one. Tha's him.\r\n           Dismounting, they move with menace that is tinged with\r\n           perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence. Solomon\r\n           tries to fight back, but he is strong armed and tied by\r\n           TIBEATS - his wrists, and then ankles bound in the same\r\n           manner. In the meantime the other two have slipped a\r\n           cord within Solomon's elbows, running it across his back\r\n           and tying it firmly. Solomon is then dragged toward a\r\n           peach tree. A lynching is in store. The naked horror of\r\n           it intensely palpable.\r\n           Solomon looks toward the piazza, but Chapin is now gone.\r\n           Tears of fear flow down Solomon's cheeks. He is on the\r\n           verge of panic; a man heading toward his own execution,\r\n           he begins to struggle and fight.\r\n           A rope goes around Solomon's neck, then is tossed over\r\n           the branch of the tree. The trio begin to hoist Solomon.\r\n           He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the\r\n           life is choked from him.\r\n           With suddenness, Chapin comes from the house brandishing\r\n           a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson .36 caliber\r\n           \"Holster\" pistols with 9\" barrels. Chapin moves with\r\n           determination toward the lynch mob. He is sharp and\r\n           matter of fact. With the guns in hand, he really doesn't\r\n           need to be much more demonstrative.\r\n\r\n                          CHAPIN\r\n           Gentlemen...

Ford holds\r\n           a mortgage on Platt of four\r\n           hundred dollars. If you hang him,\r\n           he loses his debt. Until that is\r\n           canceled you have no claim to his\r\n           life.\r\n           Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          58.\r\n\r\n                         84 CONTINUED: (5) 84\r\n\r\n                          CHAPIN (CONT'D)\r\n           As for you two, if you have any\r\n           regard for your own safety...I\r\n           say, begone!\r\n           Ramsay and Cook don't need to be told twice. The pistols\r\n           Chapin's gripping make the situation real clear. Without\r\n           further word, they mount their horses and ride away.\r\n           Tibeats remains, and his anger with him.\r\n\r\n                          TIBEATS\r\n           Yah got no cause.

The scene is both tranquil and horrific. Life on\r\n           the plantation continues. The OTHER SLAVES work in the\r\n           field. CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard.\r\n           It should all underscore the fact that a black, hanging\r\n           even partially from a tree, is nothing unusual in this\r\n           time and space.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          59.\r\n\r\n                         85 CONTINUED: 85\r\n           Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his\r\n           hands.

He may not die from hanging, but he may\r\n           very well expire before the day is over.\r\n           Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly, and as though she\r\n           were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of\r\n           water from a tin cup, pouring it in Solomon's mouth for\r\n           him.

It is sharp contrast to\r\n           the bleak surroundings, shacks and dungeons Solomon has\r\n           largely been accustom to during his time of slavery.

MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/BACK PORCH - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n           -END OF JANUARY, 1842-\r\n           From the back porch, we come into the scene on EDWIN\r\n           EPPS; a repulsive and coarse man. His language gives\r\n           speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed\r\n           the advantages of an education.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          61.\r\n\r\n                         90 CONTINUED: 90\r\n           Epps reads the Bible to his slaves, eight of them\r\n           altogether. ABRAM; a tall, older slave of about sixty\r\n           years. WILEY, who is forty eight. PHEBE, who is married\r\n           to Wiley. BOB and HENRY who are Phebe's children, EDWARD\r\n           and PATSEY. Patsey is young, just 23 years old...though\r\n           in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. She\r\n           is the offspring of a \"Guinea nigger,\" brought over to\r\n           Cuba in a slave ship. She nearly brims with unconversant\r\n           sexuality.\r\n           MISTRESS EPPS, Epps's wife, is also present. She sits\r\n           with, holds quite lovingly, some SLAVE CHILDREN. WITH\r\n           THEM SHE IS VERY \"MOTHERLY.\" We also see Epps's overseer\r\n           TREACH. Treach constantly sports a LOADED PISTOL.\r\n           Though Epps reads the word of the Lord, he lacks the tone\r\n           of compassion with which Ford read.\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           \"And that servant which knew his\r\n           Lord's will...WHICH KNEW HIS\r\n           LORD'S WILL and prepared not\r\n           himself...PREPARED NOT HIMSELF,\r\n           neither did according to his will,\r\n           shall be beaten with many\r\n           stripes...\" D'ye hear that?\r\n           \"Stripes.\" That nigger that don't\r\n           take care, that don't obey his\r\n           lord - that's his master - d'ye\r\n           see? - that 'ere nigger shall be\r\n           beaten with many stripes.

As we move out, we identify\r\n           PATSEY, a 23 year old striking black woman. The camera\r\n           moves out again to a wider shot. This reveals several\r\n           lines of slaves picking cotton, with Patsey way out in\r\n           the lead. \r\n           We cut to another pair of black hands. This time,\r\n           revealing SOLOMON, clumsy and unskilled hands, picking\r\n           cotton. A lash bears down on him.\r\n           It is August, \"cotton picking\" season.\r\n           We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom. It\r\n           presents a visual purity, like an immaculate expanse of\r\n           light, new-fallen snow. The cotton grows from five to\r\n           seven feet high, each stalk having a great many branches\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          62.\r\n\r\n                         91 CONTINUED: 91\r\n           shooting out in all directions and lapping each other\r\n           above the water furrow.\r\n           There is a slave to each side of the row. They have a\r\n           sack around their necks that hangs to the ground, the\r\n           mouth of the sack about breast high. Baskets are placed\r\n           at the end of the furrows. Slaves dump their sacks of\r\n           cotton in the baskets, then pick until their sacks are\r\n           again filled.\r\n\r\n                          EDWARDS\r\n           Pick that cotton. Move along now.\r\n\r\n           THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE\r\n\r\n           RUSTLE OF LABOR, THE MALE CICADAS BUGS \"TYMBALS\" IN THE\r\n           HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES.\r\n           Despite the heat, there is no stopping for water. The\r\n           slaves are \"driven\" by Edward, who is himself \"driven\" by\r\n           Treach.\r\n\r\n                          TREACH\r\n           C'mon.

The slaves are now assembled in\r\n           the gin house with their baskets of cotton which are\r\n           being weighed by Treach.

Corn is ground in a small\r\n           hand mill. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,\r\n           placed in the fire and baked. When it is \"done brown\"\r\n           the ashes are scraped off. Bacon is fried.

A few moments of\r\n           Epps's lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear.\r\n           Jealousy mounting, she snatches up a CARAFE. With all\r\n           her might she throws it at Patsey. It hits Patsey square\r\n           in the face. TOO THICK TO SHATTER, IT LEAVES HER BLOODY\r\n           AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR. The dancing, the music stop.\r\n           The slaves, however, react as though it is not the first\r\n           time they've seen as much from the Mistress.\r\n           Mistress Epps, screaming like a hellion:\r\n\r\n                          MISTRESS EPPS\r\n           Sell her!\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           C'mon, now.

ROAD - DAY\r\n\r\n           Solomon walks along a well-worn path, shopping bag draped \r\n           over one shoulder. We see his feet. As the walk slowly \r\n           gathers pace, Solomon suddenly turns left into dense \r\n           foliage. His tread is now a full blown sprint, trees \r\n           flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods. \r\n           The sound of branches cracking underneath. His feet, \r\n           heartbeat and breath almost deafening. He is desperate. \r\n           The violence of his advance abruptly stops, there is \r\n           silence. We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers, \r\n           preparing for a lynching of two young men. Solomon's \r\n           eyes meet theirs. The two men look back at Solomon with \r\n           a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose \r\n           around their neck. Suddenly the bloodhounds start \r\n           barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of \r\n           Solomon. Solomon's whole body shakes with anticipation. \r\n\r\n                          PATROLLER \r\n\r\n                          (AGGRESSIVELY) \r\n           Boy, where are you going? \r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON \r\n           (almost tripping over \r\n\r\n                          HIS WORDS) \r\n           To the store, Sir, to \r\n           Bartholomew's. I was sent there \r\n           by Mistress Epps. \r\n           The patroller reaches out for Solomon's free pass around \r\n           his neck, yanking him forward. He looks at it. \r\n\r\n                          PATROLLER \r\n           Get there and get there quick. \r\n           The patroller kicks Solomon hard, sending him on his way. \r\n           Solomon walks on, looking one more time at the two young \r\n           men; again there is a moment of connection. \r\n           Solomon turns. The two men are hoisted up, kicking and \r\n           spitting, behind his shoulder. \r\n           Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards \r\n           Bartholomew's, his face now full of shock and \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n           68A.\r\n\r\n          A101 CONTINUED: A101\r\n           trepidation.

As she does so, the slave, a YOUNG\r\n           WOMAN, commences to pour tea.\r\n           As if to punctuate her thought, the Mistress takes a sip\r\n           of her tea.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         105 105\r\n\r\n           EXT.

Waiting on\r\n           the porch of the Great House, a drunk Epps beckons for\r\n           Patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n           72.\r\n\r\n                         105 CONTINUED: 105\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           Pats...!

He lifts himself and\r\n           moves toward the pair in a rage.\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           Patsey...!\r\n           Solomon moves between Epps and Patsey, cutting Epps off\r\n           as Patsey continues on. Playing up his \"ignorance\" of\r\n\r\n                          THE SITUATION:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Found her, Master, and brought her\r\n           back just as instructed.\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           What'd you jus now tell her?\r\n           What'd you say to Pats?\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           No words were spoken. None of\r\n           consequence.\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           Lie! Damned liar! Saw you\r\n           talkin' with 'er.

Epps gives chase. Solomon begins to run around\r\n           the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. Epps,\r\n           however is undeterred. He moves after Solomon as\r\n           speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all.\r\n           And quickly he tires. Epps is forced to bend over and\r\n           suck air. Solomon maintains his distance, barely\r\n           breathing hard. His breath returned to him, Epps starts\r\n           up the chase again. Solomon runs on out of reach.\r\n           Shortly, Epps again stops, gets his breath... And now in\r\n           what should be quite comical, Epps again runs after\r\n           Solomon. Again, Epps's vigor leaves him before he can\r\n           even get close to the slave.\r\n           Dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          73.\r\n\r\n                         105 CONTINUED: (2) 105\r\n\r\n                          EPPS (CONT'D)\r\n           Platt... Platt, liquor filled me.\r\n           I admit that it did, and I done\r\n           over reacted. It's the Lord's\r\n           day. Ain't nothin' Christian in\r\n           us carryin' on like this. Help me\r\n           ta my feet, and let us both pray\r\n           to the Lord for forgiveness.\r\n           Epps extends a hand to Solomon. Cautiously, Solomon\r\n           moves close, but not too close. As Solomon draws within\r\n           striking distance, Epps lunges for him. He chases\r\n           Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more\r\n           drops down. And again offering a treaty:\r\n\r\n                          EPPS (CONT'D)\r\n           I'm all done in, Platt. I have\r\n           met my limitations, and I ain't\r\n           equal to 'em. I concede to yah,\r\n           but in the name of valor, help yer\r\n           master to his feet.\r\n           Solomon cautiously moves closer to help. Again he is\r\n           attacked by Epps - this time by knife. Sort of. Epps is\r\n           too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and\r\n           chased far around the field by Epps. ALL OF THE\r\n\r\n           PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING. A CHANGE\r\n\r\n           OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE\r\n\r\n           LIFE.\r\n           Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair.\r\n\r\n                          MISTRESS EPPS\r\n           What? Wha's the fuss?\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           A misunderstanding is all.

Upon\r\n           returning, Master Epps believed\r\n           Patsey and me to be in\r\n           conversation when we were not. I\r\n           tried to explain, but it lead to\r\n           all this.\r\n\r\n                          MISTRESS EPPS\r\n           What is it?

As before THEY SING A\r\n           SPIRITUAL, the only thing that distracts them from the\r\n           tedium at hand.\r\n           But there is no distracting from the heat. We see Henry\r\n           begin to falter before it... And eventually collapse\r\n           right in the dirt. Though the other slaves take note,\r\n           none move to help him. None dare.\r\n           From Treach rather matter of factly:\r\n\r\n                          TREACH\r\n           Get him water.\r\n           Edward runs to fetch a gourd.

MASTER EPPS'S PLANTATION/SMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\n           On top of a wood pile, in the back of the smoke house -\r\n           Epps shoves Patsey. He stops, stands as if gathering his\r\n           manhood, then he's all over Patsey. He is rough and\r\n           clumsy. It looks like something between an awkward rape\r\n           and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter.\r\n           Patsey does not respond in any way other than to\r\n           continually turn her head from Epps, but otherwise remain\r\n           as still as possible. If there is such a thing, she is\r\n           vicious with her passive aggressiveness.\r\n           Epps's frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw\r\n           had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to\r\n           violence. He begins slapping Patsey to get a response\r\n           from her. When that fails, he punches her which only\r\n           leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey\r\n           MERCILESSLY. Still, she gives him nothing. Beaten,\r\n           Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton, Epps deep\r\n           breathing above her. The desire for sex now having left\r\n           him.\r\n           Epps heads from the field.

As he walks, SOLOMON LOOKS AROUND CASUALLY. When\r\n           he is certain he is alone, he sets down the sack, opens\r\n           it and appropriates A SINGLE SHEET OF THE PAPER which he\r\n           folds and places in his pocket. That done, he cinches up\r\n           the sack and continues on his way.\r\n\r\n          76.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         111 OMIT 111\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          112 INT.

He\r\n           acts as though he's hiding away found gold. In reality\r\n           it's more than that.

Coming in\r\n           quick from the previous scene, we go from Solomon holding\r\n           his fiddle, to playing it as the slaves are again made to\r\n           dance.\r\n           Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked\r\n           pastries. She sets them down on a table.\r\n\r\n                          MISTRESS EPPS\r\n           A moment from the dancing. Come\r\n           sample what I baked for y'all.\r\n           The slaves, thankful for the rest as much as the food,\r\n           file toward the tray reciting a chorus of \"Thank you,\r\n           Mistress.\" As Patsey moves toward the pastries:\r\n\r\n           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)\r\n           There'll be none for you, Patsey.\r\n           Patsey merely turns away. Her non responsiveness,\r\n           however, serves only to incite the Mistress. Screaming:\r\n\r\n           MISTRESS EPPS (CONT'D)\r\n           Yah see that?

For a few beats she avoids eye contact\r\n           with Solomon. She seems, like Solomon, to be\r\n           unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened\r\n           by them. Eventually her eyes meet Solomon's. She makes\r\n           no sound, but great apprehension spills from her eyes.\r\n           Whatever's next, whatever horror awaits, she can barely\r\n           stand to face. Fear, proximity...

Solomon\r\n           tries to jerk his hand away, but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE.\r\n           Manipulating Solomon's hand, she begins to massage her\r\n           breast. Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -\r\n           really, neither does Anna. THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE\r\n\r\n           ANNA IS JUST SO VERY, VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT,\r\n\r\n           FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN\r\n\r\n           AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE\r\n\r\n           SOLOMON.\r\n           The need quickly compounds. Anna presses her lips to\r\n           Solomon's. Eventually, SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER\r\n           DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS. Solomon, with slightly more\r\n           compassion than a guy making union wages, BEGINS TO\r\n           MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND. The act remains more\r\n           perfunctory than passionate.\r\n           We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual\r\n           release. But more - or substantially less - than joyous\r\n           sex, it is really just a drug-like inoculation against\r\n           reality. But the feeling quickly fades. All that\r\n           remains, as with most chance encounters, is regret.\r\n           And there is shame, too. This is put on display as Anna\r\n           turns away from Solomon. As quickly as it began, it is\r\n           as though the act had not happened at all.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         122 122\r\n\r\n                          OMIT\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          123 EXT.

It is yellowed, showing age, but still usable.\r\n           Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed\r\n           berries, Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper.\r\n           The berry juice, too free-flowing, is unusable as ink.\r\n           Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle.

They are engraved onto \r\n           the violin, in the hidden area where Solomon would rest \r\n           his chin. \r\n           Solomon looks at it for a moment, moving his fingertips \r\n           across the engraving.

A group of REVELERS have gathered and are on the\r\n           dance floor, in fancy dress. Their faces are covered with\r\n           a variation of decorative masks. The party is a feast of\r\n           celebration. As entertainment, SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A\r\n           GROUP OF MUSICIANS, no more than three. And as he does\r\n           so, they all play with jovial liveliness.

As he walks, Solomon eats from a\r\n           HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD. Obviously part of his haul from\r\n           the evening. Solomon again hears noises coming from the\r\n           brush just up ahead of him. Solomon tears off some of\r\n           the bread, kneels and holds it out before him.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           C'mere.

Instead, from the dark and\r\n           the brush step TWO BLACK MEN. Solomon stands. He looks\r\n           the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves\r\n           covered in dirt. It becomes quite clear they are not\r\n           just slaves. A fact confirmed when they step menacingly\r\n           toward Solomon, ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND.\r\n           At first it seems they want Solomon's food or money.\r\n           Worse, THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE.\r\n           Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is\r\n           attacked, TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM. Solomon fights back,\r\n           PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the\r\n           head. That takes the fight out of him, and both men\r\n           retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         A129 A129\r\n\r\n           EXT.

From the\r\n           edge of the bayou, coming forth like an apparition arisen\r\n           from the earth, is CELESTE. She is a young woman of\r\n           about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks.\r\n\r\n           \"IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER\r\n           FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD.\" Beyond\r\n           that, she is pale and haggard, but still lovely.\r\n           Dressed in a white gown, she emerges from the water.\r\n           Draped on her dress, her period. A line in her skirt.\r\n           It's very visible, but not shocking. A ribbon of red in\r\n           her dress.\r\n           Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation. As\r\n           Solomon, startled, takes her in, Celeste says quite\r\n\r\n                          PLAINLY:\r\n\r\n                          CELESTE\r\n           I am hungry.

Soon, Solomon realizes he is in quite\r\n           literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then\r\n           neck deep. With no way to orient himself, no means to\r\n           guide him in the dark, Solomon's reserve begins to\r\n           crumble.

His panic should be that tangible.\r\n           It is either force of will, or survival instinct...or\r\n           maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he\r\n           reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing.

I\r\n           miss them so. It would be an\r\n           unspeakable happiness to clasp my\r\n           wife and my family again.\r\n           Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and\r\n           looks over his shoulder, as if to camouflage the\r\n           conversation by work. They both lift it toward the\r\n           floorboards.

I've been traveling this\r\n           country for the best part of\r\n           twenty years. My freedom is\r\n           everything. The fact that I can\r\n           walk out of here tomorrow gives me\r\n           most pleasure. I see the aching in\r\n           your eyes, the pain of not being\r\n           attached to your loved ones. My\r\n           life doesn't mean much to anyone,\r\n           but it seems your life means a lot\r\n           to a lot of people. What you have\r\n           just said to me scares me, and I\r\n           must say, sir, I am afraid. Not\r\n           just for you, but for me.\r\n           They continue working, fixing the floorboards in unison.\r\n           Solomon, slightly confused.\r\n\r\n                          BASS (CONT'D)\r\n           I will write your letter sir, for\r\n           if I could bring freedom to you,\r\n           it will be more than a pleasure.\r\n           It will be a duty.

Drearily he walks. His\r\n           eyes acknowledge something we yet cannot see to his left.\r\n           Almost simultaneously, his eyes retract back to the path\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                          (CONTINUED)\r\n\r\n          116A.\r\n\r\n          A165 CONTINUED: A165\r\n           towards Epps'.

As they do so, Bass peels\r\n           away from the structure to have an overview. He beckons\r\n           Solomon toward him, out of earshot from the slaves who\r\n           are continuing to work on the gazebo. As Solomon\r\n           approaches, Bass shouts-\r\n\r\n                          BASS\r\n           And bring those markers!\r\n           Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and\r\n           approaches Bass.\r\n\r\n                          BASS (CONT'D)\r\n           No letter yet.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           You are certain?\r\n           Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the\r\n           earth.\r\n\r\n                          BASS\r\n           I have inquired thoroughly.

But in the strength of\r\n           their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold\r\n           each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how\r\n           greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,\r\n           we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The\r\n           moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither\r\n           man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment\r\n           longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his\r\n           way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.\r\n           Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         166 166\r\n\r\n                          OMIT\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         167 OMIT 167\r\n\r\n          118.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n          A168 EXT. ROAD BY EPPS' PLANTATION - EVENING A168\r\n\r\n           Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in\r\n           hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on\r\n           something that is a million miles away.\r\n           Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg\r\n           tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound\r\n           is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as\r\n           if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the\r\n           breaking point of sound, there is a snap.\r\n           He then repeats the action.\r\n           Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb\r\n           and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it\r\n           at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it\r\n           from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the\r\n           ground.\r\n           He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it\r\n           falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small\r\n           bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of\r\n           violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in\r\n           an odd way, respectful.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         168 168\r\n\r\n           EXT.

As it will be\r\n           my pleasure to bankrupt you in the\r\n           courts. Your decision.\r\n           By this time, the slaves in the plantation have overcome\r\n           their fear of penalty, and left their work and gathered\r\n           in the yard as witnesses. They stand behind the cabin,\r\n           out of sight of Epps.\r\n           Mistress Epps also bears witness, standing on the veranda\r\n           next to her house slave. Her face is of a strange mixed\r\n           emotion.\r\n           Epps looks to Solomon. Solomon icily, stoically holds\r\n           his ground. He makes it quite clear in his countenance\r\n           that nobody owns him. Sheriff, hand on his gun, is there\r\n           to back Solomon up. Epps, with no other recourse than to\r\n\r\n                          BACK DOWN:\r\n\r\n                          EPPS\r\n           You think this is the last you'll\r\n           see of me, boy?

Solomon is pulled back\r\n           by the call of Patsey's voice:\r\n\r\n                          PATSEY\r\n           Platt...\r\n           Disregarding Parker, Solomon crosses over to Patsey.\r\n           Under the circumstances, neither really knows how to\r\n           engage. Finally, suddenly, Patsey throws her arms around\r\n           Solomon and they embrace.\r\n           Epps, now mounted on his horse, witness the encounter.\r\n           Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse, he\r\n           rides off furiously.\r\n           Calling from the carriage, mindful of Epps:\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           Solomon...if we know what's wise,\r\n           we should depart.\r\n           A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other. They\r\n           separate, Solomon heading back to the carriage. He and\r\n           Parker alight.

As they move on, Patsey sinks down to the\r\n           ground, where she remains in a weary and half-reclining\r\n           state, the other slaves around her.\r\n           WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further\r\n           from the slaves - who are diminished by distance.\r\n           Solomon waves a hand to them, but the carriage rounds a\r\n           bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes\r\n           forever more.\r\n\r\n                          BLACK\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         A169 A169\r\n\r\n           EXT. NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n           -MARCH, 1853-\r\n           We now see Solomon in front of a door. A door we have\r\n           seen before at the very beginning of our story. Solomon,\r\n           aged significantly since then, stands nervously,\r\n           swallowing, and adjusting his attire. He breaths in and\r\n           holds his breath. He blows out and closes his eyes. A\r\n           tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he\r\n           wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and\r\n           looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places\r\n           his hand on Solomon's shoulder. He says gently-\r\n\r\n                          PARKER\r\n           Are you ready?\r\n           Solomon swallows and nods.\r\n\r\n                         \r\n\r\n                         169 169\r\n\r\n           INT. NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER\r\n\r\n           THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS. Mr. Parker enters, Solomon\r\n           behind. We first see Anne, in her finest attire; the\r\n           Northup children: Alonzo, who is now seventeen and\r\n           Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A\r\n           BUNDLE. Also present is MARGARET'S HUSBAND. The family\r\n           waits patiently, dutifully...but anxiously.\r\n           Anne rises to greet him, but holds back. All around, the\r\n           body language of the family is stiff and awkward. They\r\n           are, after all - after twelve years - little more than\r\n           familiar strangers.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           I apologize for my appearance. I\r\n           have had a difficult time of\r\n           things these past many years.\r\n           Solomon looks among his family; trying to recall them as\r\n           much as they look to see familiarity within him. To his\r\n\r\n                          CHILDREN:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)\r\n           Alonzo... Margaret, yes? You do\r\n           not recognize me, do you?

Looking to the\r\n\r\n                          UNKNOWN MAN:\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON (CONT'D)\r\n           And who is this?\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           He is my husband.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           Husband?\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET'S HUSBAND\r\n           It is very good to meet you, sir.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           We have much acquainting to do.\r\n           Margaret rises, she presents her bundle to her father.\r\n\r\n                          MARGARET\r\n           And this is your grandson.\r\n           Solomon Northup Staunton.\r\n\r\n                          SOLOMON\r\n           ...Solomon...\r\n           The fact his grandson carries his name, is overwhelming.\r\n           Solomon breaks down.
