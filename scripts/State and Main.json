JOE'S ROOM - DAY\n\n   Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil.  He sits on the\n   bed.  On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red\n   hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been\n   knitted in baby blue.  There is a card in the picket that\n   reads \"Better than new -- it's got a story!\"  He puts it\n   down.\n\n   He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: \"The\n   Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same\n   mistake twice.\"\n\n   He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts\n   the lure, which still has the attached card reading \"The\n   truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth \n   - Joseph Turner White.\"\n\n   Joe goes to the bed.  On the bed is a small package tied with\n   ribbon.  Joe opens it.\n\n   ANGLE INS.\n\n   It is a small thing of maple syrup.  Attached to it is a card\n   reading: \"It is your invention which makes everything sweet.\"\n\n   He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook.  Out of\n   his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford\n   Sentinel.\n\n   He picks it up.\n\n   ANGLE JOE'S POV\n\n   The masthead: Waterford Sentinel \"The Voice of the Mountains,\n   You Shall Not Bear False Witness.\"\n\n   He puts the newspaper down.  Picks up the maple sugar card\n   again, and looks at it.\n\n   He sees an arrow and turns it over\n\n   ANGLE INS.\n\n   The back of the card reads: \"How about an Associate Producer\n   credit...?\"\n\n   He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the\n   trash.  He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the\n   typewriter.  Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it\n   in the trash.  Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and\n   starts packing...\n\n   EXT. ANN'S STREET - DAY\n\n   On Doc Wilson, as he walks down the street.
