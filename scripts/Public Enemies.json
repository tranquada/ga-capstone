MILAN WOMEN'S PRISON - GRANITE WALL - DAY\n</b>\n          PAN LEFT and fall EXTREMELY CLOSELY onto the face of Charles\n          Winstead. He waits.\n\n<b>          WIDER - WINSTEA.D\n</b>          is in an interview cell.\n\n<b>          INT. CELL BLOCK - TRACKING A WOMAN'S FEET\n</b>\n          in prison issue shoes down the cellblock corridor. ARM UP. It\n          is Billie Frechette. She walks with two guards behind her.\n\n<b>          INT. INTERVIEW CELL - DOOR OPENS\n</b>\n          Billie enters. She's surprised to see Winstead.\n\n<b>          WINSTEAD\n</b>          How are you doing, Billie?\n\n<b>          BILLIE\n</b>\n<b>          (SITS)\n</b>          If you come here to ask me more damned\n          questions. \"Where's this one or that one?\n          Did I know Vern Miller?

Billie senses none of the cunning of the lawyer/special\n          agents she's been dealing with. She leans forward, indicates\n          a cigarette out of Winstead's pocket.\n          He hands her one and lights it.\n\n<b>          BILLIE\n</b>          Okay, Mr. Winstead.

And\n          I put my ear next to his mouth and what I\n          think he said was this.

Winstead knows this.\n          It is the measure of this man that he respected the privacy\n          of John Dillinger's message and only told her.\n\n\n\n<b>                               THE END\n</b>\n\n\n\n\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b>\n<b>          \n</b><b> \n</b>\n</pre><br/>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\" width=\"85%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/posters/Public-Enemies.jpg\"/>\n</td><td><h1>Public Enemies</h1><br/><br/>\n<b>Writers</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ronan Bennett\" title=\"Scripts by Ronan Bennett\">Ronan Bennett</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Michael Mann\" title=\"Scripts by Michael Mann\">Michael Mann</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/writer.php?w=Ann Eiderman\" title=\"Scripts by Ann Eiderman\">Ann Eiderman</a><br/>\n<b>Genres</b> : \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Crime\" title=\"Crime Scripts\">Crime</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama</a>\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"/genre/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller</a><br/><br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com/Movie Scripts/Public Enemies Script.html#comments\" title=\"Public Enemies comments\">User Comments</a>\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=\"1\" src=\"http://www.imsdb.com/images/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"/><br/>\nBack to IMSDb</a>\n</div><br/>\n<br/><br/>\n</td>", "scraped": "2018-03-10 22:13:59.162254"}
