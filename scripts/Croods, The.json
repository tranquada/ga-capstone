She was alive because she\r\n           listened to her father and lived her life\r\n           in routine and darkness and terror. So\r\n           she was happy.

Outside, we hear the\r\n          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.\r\n                         \r\n          But then, SILENCE.\r\n                         \r\n          And then cutting through the primordial night is a\r\n          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps\r\n          around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the\r\n          \"door\" to peer outside, when suddenly--\r\n                         \r\n          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around\r\n          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.\r\n          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to\r\n          catch it in her hands.\r\n                         \r\n          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to\r\n          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more\r\n          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the\r\n          disappearing light.\r\n                         \r\n          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the\r\n          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she\r\n          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes\r\n          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just\r\n          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.\r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

The hot night wind blows against her face\r\n          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is\r\n          exhilarating.\r\n          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it\r\n          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her\r\n          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels\r\n          herself.\r\n                         \r\n          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING\r\n          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to\r\n          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,\r\n          we...\r\n                         \r\n                          CUT TO:\r\n                         \r\n                         \r\n          EXT.

As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was\r\n          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.\r\n                         \r\n          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on\r\n          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.\r\n                         \r\n          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,\r\n          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and\r\n          creeps up behind her.\r\n                         \r\n          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away\r\n          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at\r\n          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her\r\n          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs\r\n          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.\r\n          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps\r\n          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash\r\n          the Creature's brains in.\r\n                         \r\n                          CREATURE\r\n           Nuh!

Finally, she stood at the very\r\n           edge, and she saw a light.
