She looks\nat her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;\nbright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --\n\nBELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)\n\nAll of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare\ndown at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly\nravenous vampires...\n\nSLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's\nside. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and\nstands between her and the others.\n\n                                                           17.\n\n\n\n                          CARLISLE\n              Emmett, get Jasper out of here.                     \n                   (no response)\n              Emmett.\n\nEmmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the\nsnarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits\nwith the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --              \n\n                          ALICE                                   \n              I'm sorry, I... can't...                            \n\nShe slips out the door.

Go.                                \n\nEdward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing\nCarlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But\njust before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's\nagonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...\n\nINT.

It's late.                      \n\nHe climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side       \ndoor for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -       \nhe softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.         \n\n                          BELLA                                 \n              I'll leave my window open for you.\n\n                          EDWARD\n                   (quietly)                                    \n              I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.            \n\n                          BELLA                                 \n              Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's           \n              still my birthday.                                \n                   (off his nod)                                \n              Kiss me?                                          \n\n                                                           20.\n\n\n\nHe lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins               \ncarefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with      \nan almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.                    \n\nAbruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks         \noff into the night. Off Bella...                                  \n\nINT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out.

HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                                \n\nBella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,\nthrow things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.         \n\nFLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND          \nmoving away from hers...\n\nBACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --               \n\nINT.

He looks down at Bella's               \nSCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it          \nout, takes a closer look...                                       \nEXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                          \n\nON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls         \ninto the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house         \nbut stops, relief washing over her --\n\n                           BELLA\n              Edward.   You're here.\n\nHe stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows\nwhen she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.\n\n                          EDWARD\n              Walk with me?\n\n                                                        21.\n\n\n\nEdward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets\nhim guide her toward the woods...\n\nEXT. WOODS - DAY\n\nEdward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella.\n\n                          EDWARD\n              We need to leave Forks.                          \n\n                             BELLA                             \n              What?

EDWARD appears on her left     \nnow; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.\n\nON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She\ngathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,\nexhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve\nin the road ahead, and realizes --\n\n                          BELLA\n                   (yelling to Jacob)\n              I don't -- how do I turn!?\n\n                           JACOB\n              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!\n\nJacob races toward her.

Edward\nnever loosens his grip on Bella's hand.\n\nTheir path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides\nforward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN\nHOLE in the street; it's a drain.

Finally, they reach --\n\nA FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.\nThey all enter.
