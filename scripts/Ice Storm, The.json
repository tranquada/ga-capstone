Based on the novel by Rick Moody. First Draft Revised January 5, 1996\n\n\n\nEXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN\n\nSuburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The\nstill after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches\ntorn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The\ntrain lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow\nemergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from\nthe track.\n\nINT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN\n\nVarious passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.\n\nOn Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up\nin his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads\nhis Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the\nemergency exit sign.\n\nSuddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the\ntrain's engines returns.\n\nThe conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic\nnasal voice.\n\n\t\t\tCONDUCTOR \n\tGood morning ladies and gentlemen --\n\nHe sounds like a baseball announcer.\n\n\t\t\tPASSENGERS\n\t\t(mumbling, ad lib)\n\tWhat ladies?\n\n\t\t\tCONDUCTOR \n\t-- this train originating at New\n\tYork's Grand Central Station is\n\tback in service - next stop will be\n\tNew Canaan, Connecticut. New\n\tCanaan, Connecticut, next stop!\n\nHe moves on to the next car.\n\nThe train begins to move.\n\nPaul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the\nstill-dark early morning.\n\nHe looks back down at his comic book.\n\nOn the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has\nzapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the\ndestructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. \n\nThe Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look\non, stunned.\n\t\"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A\n\tVEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON.\" \"DON'T\n\tYOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO\n\tPOWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD\n\tCONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE\n\tDESTROYED THE WQRLD!\"\n\nPaul looks up again, thinking.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\tIn issue number 141 of The\n\tFantastic Four, published in\n\tNovember 1973, Reed Richards has to\n\tuse his anti-matter weapon on his\n\town son, who Annihilus has turned\n\tinto a human atom bomb. His son is\n\tthe result of Richards' coupling\n\twith the earthling Sue Storm, and\n\tthe problem is that the cosmic rays\n\tthat infused Richards and the rest\n\tof the Fantastic Four on their\n\taborted moon mission have made\n\tyoung Franklin a volatile mixture\n\tof matter and anti-matter.\n\nEXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN\n\nThe train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested\nlandscape.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\tAnd that's what it is to come from\n\ta family, if you analyze it\n\tclosely. Each of them is negative\n\tmatter for the other ones. And\n\tthat's what dying is -- dying is\n\twhen your family, which is in fact\n\tyour personal negative matter from\n\twhich you emerge -- it's when the\n\tfamily takes you back, thus hurling\n\tyou back into negative space...\n\nINT. TRAIN. CONT'D.\n\nOn Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows\nwarmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic\nbook.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n\tSo it's a paradox -- the closer\n\tyou're drawn back in, the further\n\tinto the void you're thrown.\n\nEXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING\n\nThe train slowly pulls in.\n\nThe train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night,\nemerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the\nplatform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining\ntraces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant\neven in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen\nsuburban Lolita.\n\nHe pauses, regarding them.\n\nThey stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.\n\nEXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING\n\nTo establish. A typical New England prep school.\n\nINT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING\n\nCramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with\nFrancis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.\n\nPaul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and\njumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie\nuniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail\nuntucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his\ndesk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tArise and shine, young Hood.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tI hope you changed the water in\n\tthat bong from last night.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\t\t(finishing a hit)\n\tThe water, as you call it, is a\n\tspecial mixture of amaretto and\n\tBen&Ben blended for just the exact\n\tchemical interaction with the last\n\tof our precious Thai stick.\n\nPaul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs,\nspewing uninhaled smoke.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS (CONT'D)\n\tWaste not Master Hood -- that was\n\t$20 for the bag.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\t\t(gathering books, papers,\n\t\t almost talking to\n\t\t himself)\n\tMan, Francis, you are one drug\n\taddled elitist freak, and when the\n\trevolution comes I do not want to\n\tbe lined up with you and shot,\n\t'cause you're fucking ripe for\n\tpolitical reeducation, you know,\n\tlike in the fields.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tPaul, cancel your mental\n\tappointments, baby. What are you,\n\tlike still stoned from last night?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\t\t(spraying some chloroform\n\t\t mouth spray)\n\tI gotta get to English class.\n\nINT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY\n\nAn English class in progress.\n\nPaul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the\nteacher call out.\n\n\t\t\tTEACHER \n\tLibbets?\n\n\t\t\tLIBBETS \n\tWhat Dostoyevsky is saying here is\n\tthat to be a Christian is to\n\tchoose, because you have to choose\n\tof your own choice, but since you\n\tcan't choose to be good because\n\tthat would be too rational you have\n\tto choose to be bad -- it's\n\texistential.\n\n\t\t\tTEACHER \n\tThank you Libbets, that's a very\n\tcompelling summary, but --\n\nPaul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his\nlook.\n\nINT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY\n\nAs class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tUm, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm\n\talso really a fan, and what you\n\twere saying, you know, have you\n\tever read The Idiot?\n\n\t\t\tLIBBETS \n\tThe Idiot?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tIf you liked Notes from\n\tUnderground, you'll love The Idiot.\n\n\t\t\tLIBBETS\n\t\t(turning to go)\n\tGreat, thanks for the tip.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t(after her)\n\tThe Idiot.\n\nINT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY\n\nPaul walks with Marge.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tI'm in love with Libbets Casey.\n\n\t\t\tMARGE \n\tYeah, well, you've been in love\n\twith like every other girl here, I\n\twas wondering when you'd get around\n\tto Libbets.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tIt's beyond mere physical\n\tattraction.\n\n\t\t\tMARGE \n\tThat's good, because I don't think\n\tLibbets is capable of the sex act.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tTruly? Do speak.\n\n\t\t\tMARGE \n\tMy diagnosis is messed in the head.\n\tA poor little rich girl -- I mean\n\tcheck out the jeans and fur look.\n\tAnd lend your ears to this\n\tbrutality. Like her mom and step\n\tdad and her step-sisters are going\n\tto Switzerland to ski over\n\tThanksgiving break -- and like they\n\tdidn't invite her!\n\n\t\t\tPAUL\n\tHow do you know this shit?\n\n\t\t\tMARGE \n\tThey did it last year too. It's\n\tlike traditional or something.\n\tThey've got this humongoid Park Ave\n\tapartment and she just holes up\n\tthere with a wad of cash. \n\t\t(beat)\n\tAren't the hugely wealthy sad?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\t\t(pause)\n\tYou think Francis is going to beat\n\tme to the punch here?\n\n\t\t\tMARGE \n\tSince he sleeps with every girl you\n\tever show an interest in, why don't\n\tyou just keep your Libbets thing a\n\tsecret from him?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tGood thinking Marge.\n\nINT. SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT\n\nPaul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room.\nVarious kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm\nstyle undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul\nthe tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tNo more man. I'm about to drop as\n\tit is.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tSee ya.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tWhere you going?\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tPaul, let me enlighten you about\n\tsomething.\n\tYou and I exist on two opposite\n\tsides of a great existential\n\tdivide, that being your pathetic\n\tvirginity on the one hand and my\n\tastonishing number of sexual\n\tconquests on the other. I'm off to\n\tget laid. See you.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tFlame on, asshole.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tAnd remember, with your erogenous\n\tzones lubricated as such with the\n\tmighty herb, do not attempt\n\tterrestrial contact with members of\n\tthe opposite sex -- because you\n\tdrone on like a motherfucker when\n\tyou're stoned.\n\nHe waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic\n\"stoned\" gesture, then wanders off.\n\nPaul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the\ndance floor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLATER:\n\nINT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D\n\nPaul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from\nacross the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends.\n\nINT. PARTY. CONT'D\n\nPaul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music.\nThere are just a few people left, most of them making out\nwith each other.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\t\t(stoned)\n\t-- because I've been reading\n\tKerouac and Ginsberg and those guys\n\twere creating beat culture and\n\ttraveling and sleeping wherever,\n\tand, of course, with all kinds of\n\tpeople, but when you read carefully\n\tthe various contemporary accounts\n\tof their lives, and, uh, these guys\n\tdidn't bathe much, I mean they were\n\treally filthy, with like genital\n\tcrabs, lice, exceptionally strong\n\tbody odor...\n\nLibbets smiles through her yawn.\n\nEXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT\n\nPaul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.\nSome kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.\n\nINT. DORM ROOM. EVENING.\n\nPaul is at his desk. Francis enters, wrapped in a towel,\nfresh from the shower.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tHow can you do that man?\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tDo what?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tSleep all day. I mean, look, it's\n\talready getting dark outside, and\n\tyou're just getting up.\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\t\t(beat)\n\tUm, Libbets Casey.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tWhat?\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tAha! I could sense the vibe.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tWhat do you mean?\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tAm I right or am I right?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tShit. You're not planning --\n\n\t\t\tFRANCIS \n\tMy man, I speak to you solely as a\n\tcomrade in arms offering\n\tunconditional aid. I've been giving\n\tthis one a lot of thought, and I\n\tbelieve that the two of you\n\ttogether might just reach that\n\thigher ground that --\n\nA knock at the door.\n\n\t\t\tSTUDENT  (O.S.)\n\tHood, telephone.\n\nPaul rolls off his bed, opens the door.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tDon't mess with Libbets. I mean it!\n\nINT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT\n\nPaul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tHello?\n\nINTERCUT - HOOD HOUSEHOLD. NIGHT\n\nIt's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper,\netc.) suburban house.\n\nBen Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tPaul?\n\nIn the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on\nTV.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tHi dad.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHey guy. Things ok up there? You\n\tall right?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tI'm fine dad.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tWell good. Just confirming. You'll\n\tbe on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tWell dad, actually I thought I'd\n\ttake the morning train on\n\tThanksgiving -- got a lot of\n\tstudying, papers, you know, lab\n\texperiments --\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tLab experiments? Right smart guy --\n\tPaul, you know your mother's gonna\n\tbe disappointed not to see more of\n\tyou -- In fact, let me make this\n\tmore than a simple request guy, I\n\tthink you should...\n\nIN THE BACKGROUND:\n\n\t\t\tNIXON\n\t\t(on TV, from San Clemente\n\t\t press conference) \n\tWell, with regard to the questions\n\tas to why Americans feel we were\n\twrong to make the tapes, that is\n\tnot particularly surprising. I\n\tthink that most Americans do not\n\tlike the idea of taping\n\tconversations and, frankly, it is\n\tnot something that particularly\n\tappeals to me...\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHold on for a second.\n\t\t(turning)\n\tWendy, you want-to say hi to your\n\tbrother?\n\nShe frowns.\n\n\t\t\tBEN (CONT'D)\n\tCome on!\n\nShe gets up sullenly and goes to the phone.\n\n\t\t\tWENDY \n\tCharles.\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tCharles. Have you been keeping out\n\tof my shit? Have you refrained from\n\tentering the sacred precincts of my\n\troom?\n\n\t\t\tWENDY \n\tI have not touched your sh--\n\t\t(looks at father)\n\tStuff. You watching this?\n\n\t\t\tPAUL \n\tWatching what?\n\n\t\t\tWENDY \n\tNixon, doofus! It's incredible. He\n\tshould be shot.\n\n\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t(overhearing)\n\tHey, that's the president of the\n\tgoddam United States you're talking\n\tabout, Wendy!\n\nFrom the kitchen, Elena overhears. She's dressed to go out,\nbut in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese\ndinner for Wendy.\n\n\t\t\tWENDY \n\tHe's a liar!\n\t\t(still talking more to her\n\t\t father than into the\n\t\t phone)\n\tDean told him on March 21st about\n\tKalmback and Hunt, all about the\n\tpayoffs to the Watergate burglars,\n\tso you tell me where the so-called\n\t\"Dean Report\" is, but you can't\n\tbecause it doesn't exist, because\n\the lied about Haldeman and\n\tErlichman and the April 17 tape,\n\tthat's why! Liar!\n\nBen retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink.\n\n\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t(muttering)\n\tOK, OK, the defense rests.\n\t\t(to Elena in the kitchen)\n\tWant another?\n\n\t\t\tELENA (O.S.)\n\tNo thank you. We should be off.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tGotcha.\n\nHe puts the bottle back down without pouring.\n\nINTERCUT BACK TO PAUL:\n\n\t\t\tPAUL\n\t\t(on the phone)\n\tHey Charles. Charles, calm down --\n\tI wasn't in on it.\n\nElena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives\nWendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes\nto Paul on the phone.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tDinner's on the counter. We'll be\n\tat the Williams's -- you know the\n\tnumber. \n\t\t(takes the phone from\n\t\t Wendy)\n\tPaul. Hi. Is there anything you'll\n\twant, any particular kind of food\n\tor snack or anything we can stock\n\tup on?... You're all right? ... OK.\n\tSee you next week. I love you.\n\nBack to Nixon on the TV.\n\n\t\t\tNIXON \n\tWe must recognize that one excess\n\tbegets another, and that the\n\textremes of violence in the 1960s\n\tcontributed to the extremes of\n\tWatergate...\n\nOn Wendy as she regards the TV, hearing her parents'\nfarewells as they leave through the front door.\n\nEXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT\n\nA large New England Colonial, with a few modern additions and\ntouches. We hear the sound of dinner chatter.\n\nINT. WILLIAMS DINING ROOM. NIGHT\n\nThe kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and Mikey\nand Sandy Williams emerge, each holding platters of food.\nMikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen\nand barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their\nforearms -- they are the evening's \"waiters\".\n\nThey move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents\nJaney (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43,\nlarge and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with\ntheir guests, Ben and Elena Hood, and neighbors Dorothy and\nTed Franklin.\n\nWe jump cut through the evening's conversations, seen mostly\nfrom the furtive POV's of the boys.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHis brother came back --\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tFrom where?\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tVietnam.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tOh. Are we going to talk about\n\tthis, about...?\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tYou should hear. It's very sad, he\n\twas --\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJUMP CUT:\n\nJaney is whispering something into Mikey's ear, who returns\nto the kitchen.\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\tIt was a benefit for the ACLU or\n\tsomething, and Harry Reems himself\n\twas there --\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tThe man with the -- from Deep\n\tThroat?\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\tThe very one -- something about a\n\tfirst amendment defense fund --\n\twell I believe in it --\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tTed took me to see it.\n\n\t\t\tJANEY \n\tTed, how romantic.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\tI have to say, the movie didn't do\n\tmuch for me. But being in that\n\ttheater, surrounded by all those\n\thorny young college boys and\n\tperverts, there was something in\n\tthe air that --\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJUMP CUT:\n\nThe boys are pouring wine.\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\t-- pulls right up to the pump,\n\tjumps out like there's no gas\n\tshortage, oblivious, and by this\n\tpoint everybody in line's piling\n\tout of their cars ready to kill the\n\tguy, when they notice it's that\n\tReverend Edwards --\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tThe Unitarian? The new one?\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\tYeah -- claims he pulled off Creek\n\tRoad and didn't notice the line\n\tgoing back Mill Street for half a\n\tmile.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHe's either got his head in the\n\tclouds or up his --\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tI hear he's slept with half the\n\twomen in his congregation --\n\n\t\t\tTED \n\tLucky bastard!\n\nAs this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben.\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHell! -- I mean, no problemo there\n\tMikey. Here, I --\n\nJaney leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe\nof Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson\nbetween Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is,\nElena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nThe boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a\ncombination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out\ncoffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the\ncoffee pot with some nervousness.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t(unconvincing)\n\tSo fascinating. Do you get free\n\ttickets to the movies, that kind of\n\tthing?\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tNo, my job is just to analyze the\n\tentertainment stocks and advise our\n\tinstitutional investors on where to\n\tput their money. It's --\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tDon't be so modest, Ben. It's a job\n\tthat requires a certain prescience\n\twith regards to entertainment\n\ttrends. You were the first to\n\tpredict that Billy Jack would be a\n\thit --\n\n\t\t\tBEN\n\t\t(with a bit too much\n\t\t conviction) \n\tAnd as usual no one believed me...\n\nSilence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCUT TO:\n\nThe dinner party has moved to the living room for after\ndinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the\ntable. She stacks a plate on top of another.\n\n\t\t\tJANEY \n\tPlease don't.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tIt's not a bother.\n\n\t\t\tJANEY \n\tI insist.\n\t\t(beat)\n\tDon't touch them.\n\nElena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tOh.\n\n\t\t\tJANEY\n\t\t(realizing she's gone too\n\t\t far)\n\tIt's really quite all right.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tOf course.\n\nINT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT\n\nThe party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their\nstomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tAnd to think -- they met at a key\n\tparty of all things.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tA key party?\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tYou know, it's a California thing.\n\tThat scuzzy husband of hers dragged\n\ther kicking and screaming to one\n\twhen they were out in L.A. you\n\tknow, the men put their car keys in\n\ta bowl, and then at the end of the\n\tevening the women line up and fish\n\tthem out and go home with whoever's\n\tkeys they've got. Anyhow that's how\n\tshe met this Rod person or whatever\n\this name is and he's left his wife\n\tand she's packing for California.\n\tIrwin is devastated. It's so\n\tironic.\n\n\t\t\tJANEY\n\tIronic? \n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY\n\t\t(caught out)\n\tWell, um, yes. Ironic. His name is\n\tRod.\n\nINT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT\n\nThe guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss,\nand the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tThank you Janey.\n\n\t\t\tDOROTHY \n\tIt was lovely!\n\n\t\t\tBEN \n\tHey Jim, next time you've got to\n\tfill me in on whatever it is you're\n\tup to these days.\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\tWill do.\n\nINT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT\n\nAt the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey\nfinish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy,\nand they silently head back the upstairs hall.\n\nINT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT\n\nThey enter Mike's room -- the door has a \"nuclear waste \npositively no admittance\" sign on it.\n\nAs Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and\nstarts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto\nthe bed, his head leaning over the far side.\n\nSandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed.\nTaken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks\nit up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of\nMike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice.\n\n\t\t\tSANDY\n\tStupid!\n\t\t(pause, looking sullenly\n\t\t at Mike's back)\n\tIs Wendy Hood your girlfriend?\n\n\t\t\tMIKEY\n\t\t(not looking up, but\n\t\t alarmed)\n\tWho said so?\n\n\t\t\tSANDY\n\tNo one.\n\n\t\t\tMIKEY\n\tI don't have a girlfriend.\n\nMikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman,\nobviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose.\nAs he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING\nSOUND begins to fill his ears.

Just\n\tgeometry.\n\nHe looks at the book.\n\n\t\t\tMIKEY (CONT'D)\n\t\t(drawing out his examples\n\t\t on a piece of paper) \n\tIt's like, you know when they say\n\t\"two squared\"? And you think it\n\tmeans 2 times 2, equals 4? But\n\treally they really mean a square. A\n\tsquare with a side of two. And the\n\tarea of the square is four. Like\n\tevery time you use the word, like\n\tsquared, or cubed, it's really\n\tspace, it's not numbers, it's\n\tspace.\n\tAnd it's perfect space, but only in\n\tyour head, because you can't draw a\n\tperfect square, like in the\n\tmaterial world, but in your mind,\n\tyou can have perfect space.\n\t\t(pause)\n\tYou know?\n\nAs Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear\nfaintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.\n\n\t\t\tSANDY\n\tYeah. But I just need some help\n\twith my homework.\n\nA knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a\nsuitcase in his hand.\n\n\t\t\tJIM \n\tHey guys, I'm back.\n\n\t\t\tMIKEY\n\t\t(honestly confused)\n\tYou were gone?\n\nSandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause.\n\n\t\t\tJIM\n\t\t(a look of\n\t\tdisappointment) \n\tYeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston,\n\tworking on some great new ideas\n\tabout silicon, which comes from\n\tsand, very conductive. How you guys\n\tdoing?

DAY\n\nElena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again.\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP \n\tIn many ways, the church-bound\n\ttradition of the father, son, and\n\tholy ghost is simply a version of\n\tthe parent-child-adult triad within\n\tus all. It's a primitive set of\n\tsymbols for our inner psychology.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tYou're saying that Christ is the\n\tchild, and --\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP \n\t-- And God the angry parent, and\n\tthe Spirit the hope of an\n\tintegrated adult self.\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tAll well and good -- But tell me\n\tagain what is it exactly that you\n\tbelieve in?\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP \n\tYou ask what the point is?\n\n\t\t\tELENA \n\tThat's right.\n\n\t\t\tPHILIP \n\tSelf-realization.

CLASSROOM. DAY\n\nMikey is reading his English paper before the class.\n\n\t\t\tMIKEY \n\tBecause of molecules we are\n\tconnected to the outside world from\n\tour bodies. Like when you smell\n\tthings, because when you smell a\n\tsmell it's not really a smell, it's\n\ta part of the object that has come\n\toff of it -- molecules. So when you\n\tsmell something bad, it's like in a\n\tway you're eating it. This is why\n\tyou should not really smell things,\n\tin the same way that you don't eat\n\teverything in the world around you \n\t- because as a smell, it gets\n\tinside of you. So the next time you\n\tgo into the bathroom after someone\n\telse has been there, remember what\n\tkinds of molecules you are in fact\n\teating.\n\nAn embarrassed silence.\n\nINT. SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM.
