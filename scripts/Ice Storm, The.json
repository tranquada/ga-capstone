Based on the novel by Rick Moody. First Draft Revised January 5, 1996</title>\n\n<pre>\n\n<b>EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN\n</b>\nSuburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The\nstill after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches\ntorn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The\ntrain lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow\nemergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from\nthe track.\n\n<b>INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nVarious passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.\n\nOn Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up\nin his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads\nhis Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the\nemergency exit sign.\n\nSuddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the\ntrain's engines returns.\n\nThe conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic\nnasal voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCONDUCTOR \n</b>\tGood morning ladies and gentlemen --\n\nHe sounds like a baseball announcer.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPASSENGERS\n</b>\t\t(mumbling, ad lib)\n\tWhat ladies?\n\n<b>\t\t\tCONDUCTOR \n</b>\t-- this train originating at New\n\tYork's Grand Central Station is\n\tback in service - next stop will be\n\tNew Canaan, Connecticut. New\n\tCanaan, Connecticut, next stop!\n\nHe moves on to the next car.\n\nThe train begins to move.\n\nPaul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the\nstill-dark early morning.\n\nHe looks back down at his comic book.\n\nOn the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has\nzapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the\ndestructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. \n\nThe Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look\non, stunned.\n<b>\t\"THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A\n</b><b>\tVEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON.\" \"DON'T\n</b><b>\tYOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO\n</b><b>\tPOWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD\n</b><b>\tCONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE\n</b><b>\tDESTROYED THE WQRLD!\"\n</b>\nPaul looks up again, thinking.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n</b>\tIn issue number 141 of The\n\tFantastic Four, published in\n\tNovember 1973, Reed Richards has to\n\tuse his anti-matter weapon on his\n\town son, who Annihilus has turned\n\tinto a human atom bomb. His son is\n\tthe result of Richards' coupling\n\twith the earthling Sue Storm, and\n\tthe problem is that the cosmic rays\n\tthat infused Richards and the rest\n\tof the Fantastic Four on their\n\taborted moon mission have made\n\tyoung Franklin a volatile mixture\n\tof matter and anti-matter.\n\n<b>EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested\nlandscape.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n</b>\tAnd that's what it is to come from\n\ta family, if you analyze it\n\tclosely. Each of them is negative\n\tmatter for the other ones. And\n\tthat's what dying is -- dying is\n\twhen your family, which is in fact\n\tyour personal negative matter from\n\twhich you emerge -- it's when the\n\tfamily takes you back, thus hurling\n\tyou back into negative space...\n\n<b>INT. TRAIN. CONT'D.\n</b>\nOn Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows\nwarmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic\nbook.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL (V.O.)\n</b>\tSo it's a paradox -- the closer\n\tyou're drawn back in, the further\n\tinto the void you're thrown.\n\n<b>EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nThe train slowly pulls in.\n\nThe train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night,\nemerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the\nplatform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining\ntraces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant\neven in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen\nsuburban Lolita.\n\nHe pauses, regarding them.\n\nThey stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.\n\n<b>EXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING\n</b>\nTo establish. A typical New England prep school.\n\n<b>INT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING\n</b>\nCramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with\nFrancis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.\n\nPaul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and\njumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie\nuniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail\nuntucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his\ndesk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\tArise and shine, young Hood.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tI hope you changed the water in\n\tthat bong from last night.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\t\t(finishing a hit)\n\tThe water, as you call it, is a\n\tspecial mixture of amaretto and\n\tBen&amp;Ben blended for just the exact\n\tchemical interaction with the last\n\tof our precious Thai stick.\n\nPaul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs,\nspewing uninhaled smoke.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS (CONT'D)\n</b>\tWaste not Master Hood -- that was\n\t$20 for the bag.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\t\t(gathering books, papers,\n\t\t almost talking to\n\t\t himself)\n\tMan, Francis, you are one drug\n\taddled elitist freak, and when the\n\trevolution comes I do not want to\n\tbe lined up with you and shot,\n\t'cause you're fucking ripe for\n\tpolitical reeducation, you know,\n\tlike in the fields.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\tPaul, cancel your mental\n\tappointments, baby. What are you,\n\tlike still stoned from last night?\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\t\t(spraying some chloroform\n\t\t mouth spray)\n\tI gotta get to English class.\n\n<b>INT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY\n</b>\nAn English class in progress.\n\nPaul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the\nteacher call out.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEACHER \n</b>\tLibbets?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIBBETS \n</b>\tWhat Dostoyevsky is saying here is\n\tthat to be a Christian is to\n\tchoose, because you have to choose\n\tof your own choice, but since you\n\tcan't choose to be good because\n\tthat would be too rational you have\n\tto choose to be bad -- it's\n\texistential.\n\n<b>\t\t\tTEACHER \n</b>\tThank you Libbets, that's a very\n\tcompelling summary, but --\n\nPaul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his\nlook.\n\n<b>INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY\n</b>\nAs class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tUm, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm\n\talso really a fan, and what you\n\twere saying, you know, have you\n\tever read The Idiot?\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIBBETS \n</b>\tThe Idiot?\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tIf you liked Notes from\n\tUnderground, you'll love The Idiot.\n\n<b>\t\t\tLIBBETS\n</b>\t\t(turning to go)\n\tGreat, thanks for the tip.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL\n</b>\t\t(after her)\n\tThe Idiot.\n\n<b>INT.

SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT\n</b>\nPaul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room.\nVarious kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm\nstyle undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul\nthe tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tNo more man. I'm about to drop as\n\tit is.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\tSee ya.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tWhere you going?\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\tPaul, let me enlighten you about\n\tsomething.\n\tYou and I exist on two opposite\n\tsides of a great existential\n\tdivide, that being your pathetic\n\tvirginity on the one hand and my\n\tastonishing number of sexual\n\tconquests on the other. I'm off to\n\tget laid. See you.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\tFlame on, asshole.\n\n<b>\t\t\tFRANCIS \n</b>\tAnd remember, with your erogenous\n\tzones lubricated as such with the\n\tmighty herb, do not attempt\n\tterrestrial contact with members of\n\tthe opposite sex -- because you\n\tdrone on like a motherfucker when\n\tyou're stoned.\n\nHe waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic\n\"stoned\" gesture, then wanders off.\n\nPaul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the\ndance floor.\n\n<b>\t\t\t\t\t\tLATER:\n</b>\n<b>INT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D\n</b>\nPaul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from\nacross the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends.\n\n<b>INT. PARTY. CONT'D\n</b>\nPaul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music.\nThere are just a few people left, most of them making out\nwith each other.\n\n<b>\t\t\tPAUL \n</b>\t\t(stoned)\n\t-- because I've been reading\n\tKerouac and Ginsberg and those guys\n\twere creating beat culture and\n\ttraveling and sleeping wherever,\n\tand, of course, with all kinds of\n\tpeople, but when you read carefully\n\tthe various contemporary accounts\n\tof their lives, and, uh, these guys\n\tdidn't bathe much, I mean they were\n\treally filthy, with like genital\n\tcrabs, lice, exceptionally strong\n\tbody odor...\n\nLibbets smiles through her yawn.\n\n<b>EXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT\n</b>\nPaul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.\nSome kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.\n\n<b>INT. DORM ROOM.

So when you\n\tsmell something bad, it's like in a\n\tway you're eating it. This is why\n\tyou should not really smell things,\n\tin the same way that you don't eat\n\teverything in the world around you \n\t- because as a smell, it gets\n\tinside of you.

I can either\n\twalk you home, or you could crash\n\tin the guest room.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tSure. Maybe coffee.\n\n<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. PRE-DAWN\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tJIM \n</b>\tPhone's out. I hope the pipe's --\n\nHe walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst.\nThere's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle\non the floor.\n\nElena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans\nagainst the counter, picking up the garter belt without\nthinking for a second, then putting it back down.\n\n<b>\t\t\tJIM \n</b>\tOh well. Why don't you put on some\n\tdry socks -- and we've got some\n\train boots in the guest closet back\n\tthere. Last room upstairs -- back\n\tof the hall.\n\nElena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.\n\n<b>INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. CONT'D\n</b>\nElena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy asleep.\nShe stands before the bed, and gazes down on them.\n\nThey look almost angelic.\n\nWendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes,\nslowly coming out of sleep.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA\n</b>\t\t(heartbroken, softly)\n\tGet dressed.\n\nElena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen.\n\nWendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping\npeacefully.\n\nShe looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up\naround him.\n\n<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN\n</b>\nElena and Jim are drinking coffee.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tYou should let him sleep.\n\nWendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWENDY \n</b>\tWhere's dad?\n\n<b>INT. HOOD CAR. DAWN\n</b>\nBen continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window,\nand sees something. He puts on his brakes.\n\n<b>EXT. STREET. DAWN\n</b>\nBen gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy\nembankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a\nparka.\n\nHe walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in\nthe wet ice.\n\nBen leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in\namazement and saddened shock.\n\nHe stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up,\ncarrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now\nthat he is parked just a short block from the Williams's\nhouse.\n\nHe bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward\nthe house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from\ntime to time, then gets back up.\n\n<b>INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nVarious passengers asleep.\n\nPaul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit\nlight, cold. He reads his comic book by the light of the\nemergency exit.\n<b>\t\"DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO\n</b><b>\tPOWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD\n</b><b>\tCONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE\n</b><b>\tDESTROYED THE WORLD!\"\n</b>\nSuddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the\ntrain's engines returns.\n\nThe conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic\nnasal train conductor voice.\n\n<b>\t\t\tCONDUCTOR\n</b>\tGood morning ladies and gentlemen --\n\nOn Paul, squinting in the harsh light.\n\n<b>EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN\n</b>\nThe train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested\nlandscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency\nhighway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in\nflashing yellow lights.\n\n<b>INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN\n</b>\nElena pours Wendy a cup of coffee. They're both in their\ncoats.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWENDY\n</b>\tI don't like coffee.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA\n</b>\tIt'll warm you up.\n\nElena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip\nthe coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.\n\n<b>INT. GUEST ROOM. DAWN\n</b>\nJim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty\nbottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. The noise wakes Sandy\nup. Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip.\n\n<b>\t\t\tSANDY\n</b>\tDad?\n\nJim looks at him.\n\n<b>INT. KITCHEN. DAWN\n</b>\nElena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see\nwhat it is.\n\n<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAWN\n</b>\nElena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's\nbody onto the ground before the front steps.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tBen?\n\nHe's too breathless to speak.\n\nThey stand there, looking down at Mikey.\n\nBehind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.\n\nHe pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\tJim -- he was just up --  in Silver\n\tLane -- I think maybe -- a power\n\tline --\n\nJim picks up his son.\n\nHe carries him silently into the house.\n\nSandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back\nagainst the wall as they pass, without expression.\n\nAfter a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's\nwailing.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN \n</b>\tDo you think? Maybe we should call\n\tsomeone --\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tThe phone's out.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN (CONT'D)\n</b>\tYeah. Well, we can just --\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tBen, I don't think he wants us\n\there.\n\nWendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.\n\n<b>\t\t\tWENDY \n</b>\tWait, I --\n\nShe turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --\n\n<b>INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. CONT'D\n</b>\non the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his\nshoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing.\n\nWendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled\nmomentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward\nher -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike\nhug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and Elena\non the driveway. Sandy watches her go, his face wet with\ntears.\n\n<b>EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. CONT'D\n</b>\n<b>\t\t\tELENA \n</b>\tOh you know, for a minute I thought\n\tit was --\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN\n</b>\tPaul? Yeah. You think --\n\n<b>\t\t\tWENDY \n</b>\tHe's probably been waiting all\n\tnight at the station.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN \n</b>\tC'mon.\n\n<b>EXT. STREET. DAWN\n</b>\nElena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in. The car\nstarts and drives off.\n\nThere are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and\nfixing the power lines as they drive.\n\n<b>EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nThe train slowly pulls in. The Hood family walks down to the\nend of the platform.\n\nThe train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped,\nemerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the\nplatform, and walks to them.\n\nThey stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.\n\nWhen he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get\nin.\n\n<b>INT. HOOD CAR. EARLY MORNING\n</b>\nSunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts\nthe engine.\n\nHe squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.\n\nHe looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children\nsitting in the back seat.\n\nHe turns off the engine. Quietly, he begins to cry.\n\nHe turns to the back seat.\n\n<b>\t\t\tBEN \n</b>\tThere's something -- your mother\n\tand I -- have to tell you two --\n\nElena puts her hand out, almost touching him.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA\n</b>\t\t(softly)\n\tBen.\n\nPaul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening.\n\nShe casts her eyes downward, as does he.\n\n<b>\t\t\tELENA (CONT'D)\n</b>\t\t(her hand still not yet\n\t\t touching him)\n\tBen.\n\n<b>EXT.
