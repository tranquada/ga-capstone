He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz\n               is just noise, just an insolent noise.\n\n<b>     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.\n</b>\n     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into\n     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley\n     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him\n     his share of their fee.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               Gotta run.

An exceptional young man.\n\n     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets\n     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.\n\n<b>     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.\n</b>\n     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and\n     heads for the theater. Music continues.\n\n<b>     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.\n</b>\n     <b>The interval</b>: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming\n     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers\n     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and\n     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.\n\n<b>     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT\n</b>\n     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at\n     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and\n     he closes the curtain.\n\n<b>     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.\n</b>\n     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue\n     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on\n     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves\n     apologetically.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.\n\n<b>     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.\n</b>\n     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A\n     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers\n     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where\n     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a\n     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name\n     over the buildings behind them.\n\n<b>                         HERBERT GREENLEAF\n</b>               Mongibello. Tiny place.

By all accounts they\n               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his\n               sailboat. That's my son's talent,\n               spending his allowance.\n\n     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a\n     sober young man, listens attentively.\n\n                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)\n               Could you ever conceive of going to\n               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?\n                   (Ripley looks doubtful)\n               I'd pay you.

Now you can go for a reason.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.\n</b>\n     <b>A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up</b>.  An exuberant and\n     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides\n     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's <i>The\n     Champ</i>. <b>A HAND</b> ejects the record. When the camera finds the\n     man's face it is <b>BLINDFOLDED</b>. He's hot. He's wearing an\n     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY (O/S)\n</b>               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke\n               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.\n\n     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of\n     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses\n     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.\n\n     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered\n     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper\n     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n</b>\n     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.\n     Chet Baker's <i>My Funny Valentine</i>.  Signs everywhere of\n     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this\n     <b>BASEMENT</b> room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and\n     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows\n     give onto bars and a wall.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               Don't even know if this is a man or a\n               woman.\n\n     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He\n     flinches.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing\n     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:\n     Charlie Parker's <i>Koko</i>.  He listens hard, recognizes the\n     track.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.\n\n     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's\n     right, he smiles.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a\n     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up\n     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment\n     before closing the door behind him.\n\n<b>     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.\n     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's\n     chauffeur.\n\n<b>                         CHAUFFEUR\n</b>               Here.

DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He\n     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.\n     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks\n     and dollars.\n\n<b>                         CHAUFFEUR\n</b>               I can tell you.

NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS &amp; IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.\n</b>\n     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.\n     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.\n     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,\n     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been\n     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall\n     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS\n     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks\n     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around\n     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants\n     his name.  <i>Ripley. Ripley. Ripley!</i> he repeats in the hubbub\n     and joins the crowd around the letter <b>R</b>.  A striking young\n     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.\n\n     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a\n     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith\n     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.\n\n<b>                         MEREDITH\n</b>               What's your secret?\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               Excuse me?\n\n<b>                         MEREDITH\n</b>               No, it's just - you are American, aren't\n               you? - no, I just, I have so much\n               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.\n               It's humiliating.\n\n     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the\n     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.\n\n                         MEREDITH (cont'd)\n               I'm Meredith, by the way.

COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.\n</b>\n     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a\n     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.\n\n<b>     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.\n</b>\n     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a\n     new town. People get off.\n\n<b>     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on\n     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind\n     down through a square, passing the local church.\n\n<b>     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side\n     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men\n     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the\n     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on\n     their Vespas. The Driver chants -\n\n<b>                         DRIVER\n</b><b>               MONGIBELLO!\n</b>\n     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on\n     its way.

NIGHT.\n</b>\n     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast\n     out their version of <i>MOANIN'</i>. Dickie and Ripley arrive and\n     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with\n     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts\n     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is\n     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.\n     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses\n     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for\n     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his\n     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's\n     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to <i>Tu\n     vuo' fa' L'Americano</i> - a hit which reflects the current craze\n     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie\n     up onto the stage.\n\n<b>                         FAUSTO\n</b>                   (improvising in Italian)\n               <i>Ladies and Gentlemen.

Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.\n\n                         FAUSTO (cont'd)\n               <i>And a big round of applause for a new\n               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!</i>\n\n     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls\n     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's\n     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can\n     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience\n     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE (O/S)\n</b>                   (reading)\n               <i>I have bumped into an old friend from\n               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.\n               He says he's going to haunt me until I\n               agree to come back to New York with\n               him...</i>\n\n<b>     INT.

On the dressing table there are toiletries,\n     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and\n     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where\n     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting.

Now I had\n               never spoken to him in my life - he said\n               <i>I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want\n               you to come with me.</i> So I did.\n\n     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men\n     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a\n     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and\n     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.\n     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce\n     en route.

NIGHT.\n</b>\n     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living\n     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a\n     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through\n     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>               I could fuck this icebox I love it so\n               much.\n                   (considering Ripley)\n               What were you actually doing in New York?\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               I played piano in a few places.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>               That's one job, you told me a lot of\n               jobs.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               A few places - that's a few jobs.

DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.\n</b>\n     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next\n     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the\n     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the\n     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a\n     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>               Do you have any brothers?\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               No, no brothers, no sisters.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>               me neither.

I'm like a prune\n               anyway.\n\n     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But\n     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie\n     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with\n     his towel.\n\n<b>     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.\n</b>\n     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's\n     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious.

DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.\n     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are\n     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of\n     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly\n     impatient.

You know - he's\n               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.\n\n     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A\n     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his\n     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and\n     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish\n     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at.

There are two\n     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed\n     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside\n     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,\n     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.\n     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.\n     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the\n     accordion doors.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and\n               meet some friends of Freddie's.

Other times...\n\n     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.\n\n<b>                         DICKIE\n</b>                   (laughing and choking)\n               He's drowning me!\n\n<b>                         MARGE\n</b>               It's always the same whenever someone new\n               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,\n               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -\n               did you meet him, he's a musician? -\n               ... and especially you, of course... and\n               that's only the boys.\n\n     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.\n\n                         MARGE (cont'd)\n               Tell me, why is it when men play they\n               always play at killing each other...?\n               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               What about Cortina?\n\n<b>                         MARGE\n</b>               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to\n               Freddie... apparently it's not going to\n               work out -\n                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge\n                    notices, can't look at him)\n               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.\n\n<b>     EXT.

Freddie takes over the\n     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the\n     water.\n\n     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but\n     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering\n     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of\n     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,\n     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then\n     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted\n     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely\n     betrayed.\n\n                         FREDDIE (cont'd)\n               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,\n               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.\n\n     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting\n     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.\n\n<b>     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.\n</b>\n     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as\n     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting\n     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley\n     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.\n     Dickie notices her too.\n\n<b>     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.\n\n     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with\n     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,\n     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,\n     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their\n     shoulders.\n\n     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual\n     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their\n     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and\n     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from\n     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is\n     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,\n     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is\n     walking on water.\n\n     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,\n     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from\n     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.\n     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the\n     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.\n     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the\n     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -\n     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.\n\n     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people\n     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,\n     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.\n\n<b>     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below\n     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the\n     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,\n     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle\n     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her\n     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls\n     away.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               What's the fight about? That's her\n               fianc\u00c8, isn't it?

It isn't. It's\n               fucking primitive.\n\n     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING\n     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across\n     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.\n\n<b>                         MARGE\n</b>               Dickie!\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               I'll go and see what's the matter.\n\n<b>                         MARGE\n</b>               I'll go.\n\n<b>     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.\n</b>\n     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window\n     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening\n     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,\n     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up\n     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.\n\n<b>                         RIPLEY\n</b>               I know why you're upset.\n                   (Dickie continues playing)\n               I know about Silvana, Dickie.

Then\n     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the\n     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head\n     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.

The boat is\n     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the\n     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come\n     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death\n     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his\n     own blood, loses his grip.\n\n     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like\n     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood\n     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,\n     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's\n     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls\n     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.\n\n     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling\n     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the\n     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.\n\n     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea\n     calms.\n\n<b>     EXT.

Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he\n     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat\n     disappears under the surface.\n\n<b>     EXT. SAN REMO.

DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches\n     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He\n     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.\n\n<b>     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM.

There's a side\n               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,\n               I know no-one else sees it, which is\n               really tender.\n                   (unravelling)\n               I think I should come with you to Rome\n               and just confront him.\n\n     Ripley lights a cigarette.

A key comes\n     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive\n     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the\n     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific\n     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses.

Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of\n     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the\n     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he\n     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry.

He kneels on the floor with\n     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's\n     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a\n     glass, pours himself a drink.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT.

Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner\n     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back\n     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.\n\n<b>     INT.

Ripley\n     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about\n     <i>Signor Greenleaf</i> and <i>Signor Ripley</i>. Ripley hurries inside as\n     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.\n\n<b>     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.\n</b>\n     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open.

As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his\n     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before\n     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.\n<b>     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.\n</b>\n<b>     EXT.

He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES\n     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances\n     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images\n     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE\n     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the\n     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along\n     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an\n     Italian, runs up concerned.\n\n<b>     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.\n</b>\n     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the\n     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips\n     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.\n     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza.

He has placed one\n     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing\n     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks\n     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.\n\n     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and\n     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in.

Then Dickie's\n     saxophone.\n\n     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the\n     revolving blue light of a Police Car.

So when he makes a promise it\n               doesn't mean what it means when you make\n               a promise. Or I do.

I don't\n               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this\n               now, so just write it on a piece of paper\n               or something, and keep it in your purse\n               for a rainy day. <i>Tom loves me.</i>\n\n<b>                         MARGE\n</b>                   (as if she'd heard nothing)\n               Why do you have Dickie's rings?\n\n     His hand goes to his pocket.
